These dual intent signals are\njointly conditioned in a multi-stage generation pipeline that combines\ncontour-preserving structural control with style- and content-aware image\nsynthesis.

Existing knowledge integration solutions\ntypically rely on strong assumptions about training data distributions and\nnetwork architectures, limiting them to learning only from specific types of\nmodels and resulting in data and/or inductive biases. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel framework, namely UNIFORM, for knowledge transfer from a\ndiverse set of off-the-shelf models into one student model without such\nconstraints.

It incorporates a\npoint-native processing pipeline, including token reordering, sequence\nmodeling, and multi-agent spatial alignment. A semantic-aware token reordering\nmodule generates adaptive 1D reorderings by leveraging scene-level and\ntoken-level semantic information. A frequency-enhanced state space model\ncaptures long-range sequence dependencies across both spatial and spectral\ndomains, improving the differentiation between foreground tokens and background\nclutter.

In addition to this qualitative review,\nwe analyze 216 commercially available HSI and multispectral imaging cameras,\nbenchmarking them against key automotive criteria: frame rate, spatial\nresolution, spectral dimensionality, and compliance with AEC-Q100 temperature\nstandards. Our analysis reveals a significant gap between HSI's demonstrated\nresearch potential and its commercial readiness. Only four cameras meet the\ndefined performance thresholds, and none comply with AEC-Q100 requirements. In\naddition, the paper reviews recent HSI datasets and applications, including\nsemantic segmentation for road surface classification, pedestrian separability,\nand adverse weather perception. Our review shows that current HSI datasets are\nlimited in terms of scale, spectral consistency, the number of spectral\nchannels, and environmental diversity, posing challenges for the development of\nperception algorithms and the adequate validation of HSI's true potential in\nADAS/AD applications. This review paper establishes the current state of HSI in\nautomotive contexts as of 2025 and outlines key research directions toward\npractical integration of spectral imaging in ADAS and autonomous systems."}

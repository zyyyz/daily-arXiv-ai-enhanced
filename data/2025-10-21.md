Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward
general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily
rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured
alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome
this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied
agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is
SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating
scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic
learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from
video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for
human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both
prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph
generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently
improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces
agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary
baselines.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its
counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of
adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However,
existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving
it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this
paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class
distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector,
and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware
Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the
training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the
salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects
are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse
multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design
Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences
between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the
aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed
CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark,
CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS,
while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D
demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are
partially or entirely missing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of
closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop
cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require
timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing
automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide
unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper
proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi
defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and
passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware
summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that
includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans,
and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection,
highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and
LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation
on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system
accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We
conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city
wide deployments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold
the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection
(IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide
multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color
of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the
same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated
the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we
explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and
pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based
on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate
detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the
large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation
functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the
visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein
image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically
select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific
aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and
respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion
module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's
perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and
few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets. The codes are available at

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how
radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to
December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT),
structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on
image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.
Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students)
each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized
viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy
(compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per
radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience.
Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni
post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy
was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in
AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$
s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade
counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm
58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s
(FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P <
.001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while
non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the
preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual
attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic
accuracy and user satisfaction.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit
intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of
multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This
paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases
in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation
Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with
interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model
predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation
(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation
intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open
Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves
accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24
percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.
Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance
of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for
analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less
compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two
important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in
quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the
derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning
ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we
also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural
network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have
avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less
accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the
quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is
another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as
well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet
dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent
accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to
train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches
accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit
quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu
instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic
quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

Abstract: Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic
safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection,
however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the
difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high
error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we
propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a
Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large
separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a
Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and
pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale
Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a
dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object
detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses
existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and
mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline,
respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33%
compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while
maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that
StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency,
offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable
infrastructure management.

Abstract: Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in
autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain
vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and
distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a
technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object
detection through object specific transformations at both training and
inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space
perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color
variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic,
diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are
applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to
quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then
used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving
the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K
dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and
uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while
predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared
to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of
ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and
quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and
inference respectively.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the
appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its
wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and
digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the
geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A
straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we
show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we
propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a
pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free
method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.
This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we
experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for
appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach
successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,
outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show
that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their
inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in
absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with
a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like
assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,
our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion
models and guidance functions.

Abstract: Thrombectomy is one of the most effective treatments for ischemic stroke, but

various skeletal landmarks using a regression-based pretext task. Our
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both
regression and classification tasks. Notably, our results indicate that the
positional pretext task significantly enhances downstream classification
performance. Future work will focus on extending this framework toward fully

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data in medical imaging makes
semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from
imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained
popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly
optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially
in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we
propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with
asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or
decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy
conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing
regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance
to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input
pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose
Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen
teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation
datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and
robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable C-arm positioning is essential for fluoroscopy-guided
interventions. However, clinical workflows rely on manual alignment that
increases radiation exposure and procedural delays. In this work, we present a
pipeline that autonomously navigates the C-arm to predefined anatomical
landmarks utilizing X-ray images. Given an input X-ray image from an arbitrary
starting location on the operating table, the model predicts a 3D displacement
vector toward each target landmark along the body. To ensure reliable
deployment, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the
model's predictions and further calibrate them using conformal prediction. The
derived prediction regions are interpreted as 3D confidence regions around the
predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic
loss with skeletal pose regularization to encourage anatomically plausible
outputs. We validate our approach on a synthetic X-ray dataset generated from
DeepDRR. Results show not only strong localization accuracy across multiple
architectures but also well-calibrated prediction bounds. These findings
highlight the pipeline's potential as a component in safe and reliable
autonomous C-arm systems. Code is available at

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive progress in recent years, making
it possible to produce high quality images with a simple text prompt or a
reference image. However, state of the art technology does not yet meet the
quality standards offered by traditional photographic methods. For this reason,
production pipelines that use generated images often include a manual stage of
image quality assessment (IQA). This process is slow and expensive, especially
because of the low yield of automatically generated images that pass the
quality bar. The IQA workload can be reduced by introducing an automatic
pre-filtering stage, that will increase the overall quality of the images sent
to review and, therefore, reduce the average cost required to obtain a high
quality image. We present a formula that estimates the cost savings depending
on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine. This formula is
applied in a use case of background inpainting, showcasing a significant cost
saving of 51.61% obtained with a simple AutoML solution.

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge
in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct
visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a
latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct
images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is
to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces
images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best
supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual
stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more
similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based
space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the
generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of
visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and
relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that
Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate
representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric
diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to
reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module
that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align
with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an
8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of
using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and
image reconstruction.

Abstract: Mapping agriculture in tropical areas through remote sensing presents unique
challenges, including the lack of high-quality annotated data, the elevated
costs of labeling, data variability, and regional generalisation. This paper
advocates a Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) perspective and
pipeline, emphasizing data quality and curation as key drivers for model
robustness and scalability. It reviews and prioritizes techniques such as
confident learning, core-set selection, data augmentation, and active learning.
The paper highlights the readiness and suitability of 25 distinct strategies in
large-scale agricultural mapping pipelines. The tropical context is of high
interest, since high cloudiness, diverse crop calendars, and limited datasets
limit traditional model-centric approaches. This tutorial outlines practical
solutions as a data-centric approach for curating and training AI models better
suited to the dynamic realities of tropical agriculture. Finally, we propose a
practical pipeline using the 9 most mature and straightforward methods that can
be applied to a large-scale tropical agricultural mapping project.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to
transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state
recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,
whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training
methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to
fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are
often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic
scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models
suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and
temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal
inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a
model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos.
Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves
the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying
temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates
model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM,
which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to
seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long,
complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of
flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On
short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks,
StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%,
with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore,
our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more
robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition
scenarios.

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a complex and challenging computer vision
task, aiming to model the subjective and intricate nature of human aesthetic
perception. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), have made significant strides, they often struggle to capture
the global, holistic facial features that are critical to human judgment.
Vision Transformers (ViT) address this by effectively modeling long-range
spatial relationships, but their quadratic complexity can be a bottleneck. This
paper introduces a novel, heterogeneous ensemble architecture,
\textbf{VM-BeautyNet}, that synergistically fuses the complementary strengths
of a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model, a recent advancement in
State-Space Models (SSMs). The ViT backbone excels at capturing global facial
structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone efficiently models long-range
dependencies with linear complexity, focusing on sequential features and
textures. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark SCUT-FBP5500 dataset. Our
proposed VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
\textbf{Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9212}, a \textbf{Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.2085}, and a \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2698}.
Furthermore, through Grad-CAM visualizations, we provide interpretability
analysis that confirms the complementary feature extraction of the two
backbones, offering new insights into the model's decision-making process and
presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common type of head
and neck cancer. Due to the subtle nature of its early stages, deep and hidden
areas of development, and slow growth, OCSCC often goes undetected, leading to
preventable deaths. However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply
kernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern
recognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing
this neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow
increased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a
Convolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a
physical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to
determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was
trained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as
well as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean
Average Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of
randomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was
chosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test
data set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the
basis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture
detailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to
facilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of
increasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic
scale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts.

Abstract: Human behaviors are the major causes of scene dynamics and inherently contain
rich cues regarding the dynamics. This paper formalizes a new task of proactive
scene decomposition and reconstruction, an online approach that leverages
human-object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the
environment. By observing these intentional interactions, we can dynamically
refine the decomposition and reconstruction process, addressing inherent
ambiguities in static object-level reconstruction. The proposed system
effectively integrates multiple tasks in dynamic environments such as accurate
camera and object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and online map
updating, capitalizing on cues from human-object interactions in egocentric
live streams for a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional
object-level reconstruction methods. Aided by the Gaussian splatting technique,
accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling is achieved with photorealistic
and efficient rendering. The efficacy is validated in multiple real-world
scenarios with promising advantages.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot
detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual
grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for
efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules
offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning
during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key
innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The
former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the
latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than
enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show
that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a
151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art
VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time
video analytics.

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in
evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language
models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our
analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional
bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true
membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark
of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are
carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across
three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated
that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance
under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark,
OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and
provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving
techniques.

Abstract: Generating sketches guided by reference styles requires precise transfer of
stroke attributes, such as line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity,

propose Stroke2Sketch, a novel training-free framework that introduces
cross-image stroke attention, a mechanism embedded within self-attention layers
to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences and enable accurate stroke
attribute transfer. This allows our method to adaptively integrate reference
stroke characteristics into content images while maintaining structural
integrity. Additionally, we develop adaptive contrast enhancement and
semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground
emphasis. Stroke2Sketch effectively synthesizes stylistically faithful sketches
that closely resemble handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in
expressive stroke control and semantic coherence. Codes are available at

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake
detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the
number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images.
Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we
construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains
over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than
8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we
observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable
power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake
methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the
number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a
target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake
technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of
pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as
well as the limitations of scaling itself.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation demands both fine-grained
texture synthesis and globally coherent structure, yet current diffusion models
remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive
quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training
data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces
hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling
efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high
resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size
local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear,
while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects
global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local
pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To
maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve
order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in
a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT
achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared
to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$
resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both
quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons,
Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching
or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training.
Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with
guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for
advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have driven remarkable progress in image
generation. However, the generation process remains computationally intensive,
and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired
results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud
resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge
collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In
this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by
rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs
final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise
level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the
trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX
reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5,
while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower
than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating
efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

Abstract: Autoregressive Model (AR) has shown remarkable success in conditional image
generation. However, these approaches for multiple reference generation
struggle with decoupling different reference identities. In this work, we
propose the TokenAR framework, specifically focused on a simple but effective
token-level enhancement mechanism to address reference identity confusion
problem. Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index
Embedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference
images; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature
container to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3).
The identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token
representations toward independently representing the features of each
identity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the
capabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation,
enabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background
reconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in
multi-subject generation, we introduce the InstructAR Dataset, the first
open-source, large-scale, multi-reference input, open domain image generation
dataset that includes 28K training pairs, each example has two reference
subjects, a relative prompt and a background with mask annotation, curated for
multiple reference image generation training and evaluating. Comprehensive
experiments validate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art
models in multiple reference image generation task. The implementation code and
datasets will be made publicly. Codes are available, see

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that
its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense
parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the
understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive
images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning
(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the
significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder
as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of
training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in
strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a
critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through
diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and
segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's
post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on
MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual
representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces
stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,
boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our
findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,
Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,
a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained
counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of
standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path
for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted
Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the
discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due
to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies
in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images
of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are
predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP;
however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical
foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework,
termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong
empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun
based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy
between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output.
Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability
of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes
existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself.
Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the
state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

Abstract: Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered
resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this
paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control,
particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three
aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,
production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging
environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the
scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass
Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first
benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,
MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse
individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected
from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial
imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion
conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and
zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all
models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved
complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By
bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a
realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential
for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available at

previous parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across
various species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation,
subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep

require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many
framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance.
We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and
introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and
accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the
inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency
improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture
significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry
Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we
apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving
accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on
FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5
CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor). Our method is also evaluated on
compound benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to

Abstract: Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object
grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D
segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based
instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack
intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an
innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based
segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform
segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on
their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for
MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM
can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel
Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views
are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization,
aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several
close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained
local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive
experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting
both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly
introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly
supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal,

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating
large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize
visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in
vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning.
Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors,
its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable
reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel
framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of
verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL
objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked
patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human
preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL
substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language
reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify
key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with
the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering
new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's
generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains.
SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal
models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

Abstract: Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has
proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The
backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing
correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been
treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network
that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While
running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity,
the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge
devices.
  Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a
lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in
our architecture is the Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP), which
explicitly exposes the connectivity of the lines to the network, allowing for
efficient communication between nodes. In thorough experiments we show that
LightGlueStick establishes a new state-of-the-art across different benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated
artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional
deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of
transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities
to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for
detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning
explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection
(EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model
(MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes
alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach
first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT)
to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing
rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we
construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which
introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process
to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress
hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In
addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset
(ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality
control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding
performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and
its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.
Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior
solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize
fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned
on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition
and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action
understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action
analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our
previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million
frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using
baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization,
video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier
model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by
incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to
align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to
suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting
fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce
RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation
through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism
combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword,
scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning
trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual
spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute
levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned
cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and
temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that
RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are

Abstract: Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant
challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial
imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object
detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often
underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in
capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss
function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the
Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition,
we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address
the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our
proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a
rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric
properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into
state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and
extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average
Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the
potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object
detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise
and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained
networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive.
Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts
while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning
methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation
space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these
limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce
settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we
introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances
adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically
informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel
representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its
simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight
operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and
dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning. Our code

Abstract: Annotation-efficient segmentation of the numerous mitochondria instances from
various electron microscopy (EM) images is highly valuable for biological and
neuroscience research. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods
can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each
domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical
applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA)
that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which
require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full
use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask
learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with
a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive
learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce
segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL)
selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise
pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse
pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations
and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also
achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.

Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language
Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical
information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the
actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we
draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory
data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object
relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous
to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which
describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking
the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the
task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action
scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the
original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to
effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the
destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast,
photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in
immersive communication. However, in digital human encoding and transmission,
the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by
the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and
reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in
streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical
Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and
high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian
representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a
StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model
to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This
hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and
controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or
text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a
facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and
expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results
demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar
rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual
quality and compression efficiency.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and
reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in
detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and
equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately
undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook
this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors
that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench
(Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first
benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific
papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering
and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on
this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy
and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and
reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to
address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice
evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding
the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations
that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic
cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models
(GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5
with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%),
underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating
progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

Abstract: Out-of-stock (OOS) detection is a very important retail verification process
that aims to infer the unavailability of products in their designated areas on
the shelf. In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based
method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular,
we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with
additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment
products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product
segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation
branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore,
since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth,
we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the
training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method
surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean
average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization
procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages

representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval
process via the representative models we construct for the images and image
categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their
representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights
important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder
to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features
of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives
from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its
representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most
similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments
with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard
contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the
ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic
elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder
to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation
reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual
objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text
Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional
reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a
token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder
reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original
caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns
paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model
derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning
benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up
to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including
NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --
reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former
encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,
while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed
with different wording.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various
applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the
unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially
when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically
use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal
scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to
model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their
specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic
Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for
motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding
attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the
Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the
optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic
Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions
containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static
regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that
GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In
turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted
deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are
trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting
their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes
circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we
introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes
Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes
shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation
of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and
industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform
relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher
performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to
generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to
simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for
politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard
the public in real-world settings.

hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical
bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose
SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three
strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing
noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks
with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate
that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse
benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational

high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression
techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding
critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks,
that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To
address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight
plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end
learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer
module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable
Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the
training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various
arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable
parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various
compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to
superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving
100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by
12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however,
interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and

techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for
real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a

imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system
integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet,
and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including
model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables
flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures,
ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR.
Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%,
segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80
milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and
segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These
results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate
diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI
integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs
operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic
segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,
scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS
or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale
factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into
accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane
detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of
14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a
color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a
lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time
semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be
replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a
controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles
simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a
real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment
demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the
distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while
maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through
end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete
flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing

practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments,

only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the

context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models,
emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a
landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a
user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the
robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for
grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address
the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing
methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context
window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we
propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of
the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide
a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can
retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on
instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against
baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that
using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to
large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large
performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially
reducing the token count of the scene graph content. A video supplement is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for
pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their
capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak
noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts
the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation
models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that
utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of
unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,
we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can
be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP
was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully
degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation
models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a
dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,
but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation
models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various
state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a
significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications
to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these
potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model
robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and
potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure
the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) promise to support a range of new applications in
computer vision. Recent research has explored the feasibility of generalizable
Spectral Reconstruction (SR), the problem of recovering a HSI from a natural
three-channel color image in unseen scenarios.
  However, previous Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) works have only demonstrated
sufficient generalizable results for very sparse spectra, while modern HSI
sensors contain hundreds of channels.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to spectral reconstruction via our
HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA).
  Using a Teacher model that encapsulates latent hyperspectral image data and a
Student model that learns mappings from natural images to the Teacher's encoded
domain, alongside a novel training method, we achieve high-quality spectral
reconstruction.
  This addresses key limitations of prior SR models, providing SOTA performance
across all metrics, including an 18\% boost in accuracy, and faster inference
times than current SOTA models at various channel depths.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding,
remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify
two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming
from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D
information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set
(MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of
3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal
Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this
principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a
versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a
novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts
language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this
information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting
missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and
minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework
produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of
high-quality training data for future models. Source code is available at

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging
technique that provides detailed three-dimensional views of the retina, which
are essential for the early and accurate diagnosis of ocular diseases.
Consequently, OCT image analysis and processing have emerged as key research
areas in biomedical imaging. However, acquiring paired datasets of clean and
real-world noisy OCT images for supervised denoising models remains a
formidable challenge due to intrinsic speckle noise and practical constraints
in clinical imaging environments. To address these issues, we propose SDPA++: A
General Framework for Self-Supervised Denoising with Patch Aggregation. Our
novel approach leverages only noisy OCT images by first generating
pseudo-ground-truth images through self-fusion and self-supervised denoising.
These refined images then serve as targets to train an ensemble of denoising
models using a patch-based strategy that effectively enhances image clarity.
Performance improvements are validated via metrics such as Contrast-to-Noise
Ratio (CNR), Mean Square Ratio (MSR), Texture Preservation (TP), and Edge
Preservation (EP) on the real-world dataset from the IEEE SPS Video and Image
Processing Cup. Notably, the VIP Cup dataset contains only real-world noisy OCT
images without clean references, highlighting our method's potential for
improving image quality and diagnostic outcomes in clinical practice.

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in
practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge
thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict
the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source
domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations
learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality
is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the
performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and
discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the
deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive
learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and
obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive
data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve
intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test
domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in
pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative
transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are
performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code
are provided through https://github.com/weitianxin/DCCL

bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded
Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a
complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building
corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a
method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning
dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments
across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new
framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT
reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning
and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding
scenarios.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric
world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common
ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes,
which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds.
To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that
focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first
establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from
the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous
timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the
changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To
alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to
calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate
different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the
implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning
accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D
occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate
large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such
as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef
distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision
and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary
delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel
se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under
noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN
architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)
block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic
structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a
coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming
conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the
model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate
than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion
that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural
design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect
supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where
reliable labels are scarce.

including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics
that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between
model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language

Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show
limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We
demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive
models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search
substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter
autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across
benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the
discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and
our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning
capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is
critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

Abstract: Generative image super-resolution (SR) is rapidly advancing in visual quality

their tendency to produce artifacts: incorrect, visually disturbing details
that reduce perceived quality. Crucially, their perceptual impact varies: some
artifacts are barely noticeable while others strongly degrade the image. We
argue that artifacts should be characterized by their prominence to human
observers rather than treated as uniform binary defects. Motivated by this, we
present a novel dataset of 1302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR
methods, where each artifact is paired with a crowdsourced prominence score.
Building on this dataset, we train a lightweight regressor that produces
spatial prominence heatmaps and outperforms existing methods at detecting
prominent artifacts. We release the dataset and code to facilitate
prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation of SR artifacts.

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision,

propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for
image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored
images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform
Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image
features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile,
we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to
capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the
model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we
propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to
guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively.
Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of
the model.

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image
regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in
isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part
contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results
in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the
image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for
text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment
between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about
edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to
understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and
harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance
mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with
detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously
matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large
vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references
of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure.
Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned
results. Code is available at:

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in
artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for
clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on
Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited
exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning
techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize
simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing
cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models
dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the
Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a
promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel
X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks
using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into
patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature
extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a
hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and
achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three
widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be

novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose
regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By
leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a
pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by
comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates
color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes
in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy
improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual
Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the
video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,
task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and
limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework
for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically
combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine
learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video
understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a
high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms
a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual
encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the
continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.
These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to
identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By
selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging
the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework
automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.
This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway
for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

Abstract: Integrating diverse visual capabilities into a unified model is a significant
trend in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among these, the inclusion
of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with
pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the
model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process
typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic
generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We
introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel
plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a
completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention
maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features
directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our
approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior
to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully
preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly
degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS
establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the
way for truly multi-talented, unified models.

Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road
segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually
labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to
distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from
geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined
quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal
consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and
penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information
maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the
Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of
0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings
demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal
consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.

Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the
generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic
concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then
learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion
technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows
outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of
photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/

Abstract: Lychee is a high-value subtropical fruit. The adoption of vision-based
harvesting robots can significantly improve productivity while reduce reliance
on labor. High-quality data are essential for developing such harvesting
robots. However, there are currently no consistently and comprehensively
annotated open-source lychee datasets featuring fruits in natural growing
environments. To address this, we constructed a dataset to facilitate lychee
detection and maturity classification. Color (RGB) images were acquired under
diverse weather conditions, and at different times of the day, across multiple
lychee varieties, such as Nuomici, Feizixiao, Heiye, and Huaizhi. The dataset
encompasses three different ripeness stages and contains 11,414 images,
consisting of 878 raw RGB images, 8,780 augmented RGB images, and 1,756 depth
images. The images are annotated with 9,658 pairs of lables for lychee
detection and maturity classification. To improve annotation consistency, three
individuals independently labeled the data, and their results were then
aggregated and verified by a fourth reviewer. Detailed statistical analyses
were done to examine the dataset. Finally, we performed experiments using three
representative deep learning models to evaluate the dataset. It is publicly
available for academic

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as
climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated
monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with
point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS).
ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional
site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level
hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets,
which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not
ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global
scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source
benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and
(ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain
generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification
performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance
is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and
performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare
and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to
catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral
classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained
models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and
conservation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate and quick prediction of wood chip moisture content is critical for
optimizing biofuel production and ensuring energy efficiency. The current
widely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing
time and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods,
including near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and
image-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from
various sources. Variability in the source material can alter data
distributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,
there is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of
source variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture
features have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on
this, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct
texture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture
content. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five
texture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms
individual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust
moisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist
that utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of
wood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We
also proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual
information. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains
by 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of AdaptMoist as a robust
solution for wood chip moisture content estimation across domains, making it a
potential solution for wood chip-reliant industries.

Abstract: Mannequin-based clothing displays offer a cost-effective alternative to
real-model showcases for online fashion presentation, but lack realism and
expressive detail. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called
mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize
identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins.
We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation
framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and
body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular,
M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial
semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across
frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space
compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a
denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising.
Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical
distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS
dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site
demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing
consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to
state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced
neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual
quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In
contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian
disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains
compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality
rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both
geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently
unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that
uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while
maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians
with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D
Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place
cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R
model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the
original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional
training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality
rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings
indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance,
leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction
accuracy.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated
detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat
assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection
approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse
bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for
comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation
models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require
excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios.
This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic
segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve
superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for
resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder
backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class
weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver,
and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while
maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M
parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more
computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable
security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in
distributed security infrastructure.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully
supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS
methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally
critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent
features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative
and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment
in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples
two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For
label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we
devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively
Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch
consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For
representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance
matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex
pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four
public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further
validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality
control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However,
current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature
transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing
local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations
become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection
results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not
only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction
toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this
end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction
framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and
memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on
modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across
samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning
process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning.
This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust
to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments
on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and
generalizability.

Abstract: While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising
results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN
studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing
capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level
model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that
investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in
vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our
approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with
fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP
and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict
biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks
(including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared
representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional
redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's
fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs
exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs
showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity
and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The
architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches
show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design
yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's
influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling
evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.

Abstract: Generative models, especially Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable
capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, including medical images.
However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to
generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting
their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address
this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely,
Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our
Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide
image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better
control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and
diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance,
highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique
integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the
quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Munia03/Class-N-Diff.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however,
models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated
patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training
distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training
framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization.
Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a
likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching
forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more
efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal
reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and
tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to
provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance
group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize
optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks,
scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is
model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to
diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its
wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available at

Abstract: Aviation's non-CO2 effects, particularly contrails, are a significant
contributor to its climate impact. Persistent contrails can evolve into
cirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative
forcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2
emissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and
dissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed
contrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as
contrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due
to limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform
before detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using
ground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high
spatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually
distinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS)
dataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed
using ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft
surveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple
geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal
smoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This
work establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future
research in linking contrails to their source flight.

Abstract: Thermal weapon segmentation is crucial for surveillance and security
applications, enabling robust detection under lowlight and visually obscured

(CNNs) dominate thermal segmentation literature, their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and fine structural details is limited. Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with their global context modeling capabilities, have

adapts and evaluates four transformer-based architectures SegFormer,
DeepLabV3\+, SegNeXt, and Swin Transformer for binary weapon segmentation on a
custom thermal dataset comprising 9,711 images collected from real world
surveillance videos and automatically annotated using SAM2. We employ standard
augmentation strategies within the MMSegmentation framework to ensure robust
model training and fair architectural comparison. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance: SegFormer-b5
achieves the highest mIoU (94.15\%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04\%), while
SegFormer-b0 provides the fastest inference speed (98.32 FPS) with competitive
mIoU (90.84\%). SegNeXt-mscans offers balanced performance with 85.12 FPS and
92.24\% mIoU, and DeepLabV3\+ R101-D8 reaches 92.76\% mIoU at 29.86 FPS. The
transformer architectures demonstrate robust generalization capabilities for
weapon detection in low-light and occluded thermal environments, with flexible

performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation

zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from
segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models,
FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to
learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream
clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid
proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented,
lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of
architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities.
To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and
structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically
categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their
architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks.
Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to
characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We
also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation,
efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along
with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and
advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed
at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs,
thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered
ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing
methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based
approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to
noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global
patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal
dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation)
fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation
views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive
Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an
end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via
Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via
cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific
discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence
encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image
representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective
for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on
three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on
Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to
sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for

Abstract: Given a task and a set of steps composing it, Video Step Grounding (VSG) aims
to detect which steps are performed in a video. Standard approaches for this
task require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or
narrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full
video offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online
decisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without
training. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step
associated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.
We show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms
offline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop
Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting
knowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits
Bayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency
matrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step
progress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over
state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research
remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead
to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose
an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a
classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks,
Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on
CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant
differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video
encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of
certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities,
including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized
for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the
distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and
types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we
systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more
useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small
scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of
remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream
tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID,
an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications
specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring
consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

Abstract: We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding
utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the
capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to
effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage
process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially
transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues
to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded,
using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate
boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched
queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model
is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects
the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding
and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method
significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding
approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while
maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal 3D grounding has garnered considerable interest in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) \cite{yin2025spatial} for advancing spatial reasoning in complex
environments. However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias"
that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization,
largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called
What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via
disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our
approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D
features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as
spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without
modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss
function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted
cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes
overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism.
Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of
W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness,
particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Large fingerprint datasets, while important for training and evaluation, are
time-consuming and expensive to collect and require strict privacy measures.
Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic fingerprint data to address
these issues. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic
fingerprint images (both spoof and live), addressing concerns related to
privacy, cost, and accessibility in biometric data collection. Our approach
utilizes conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3 architectures to produce
high-resolution synthetic live fingerprints, conditioned on specific finger
identities (thumb through little finger). Additionally, we employ CycleGANs to
translate these into realistic spoof fingerprints, simulating a variety of
presentation attack materials (e.g., EcoFlex, Play-Doh). These synthetic spoof
fingerprints are crucial for developing robust spoof detection systems. Through
these generative models, we created two synthetic datasets (DB2 and DB3), each
containing 1,500 fingerprint images of all ten fingers with multiple
impressions per finger, and including corresponding spoofs in eight material
types. The results indicate robust performance: our StyleGAN3 model achieves a
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) as low as 5, and the generated fingerprints
achieve a True Accept Rate of 99.47% at a 0.01% False Accept Rate. The
StyleGAN2-ADA model achieved a TAR of 98.67% at the same 0.01% FAR. We assess
fingerprint quality using standard metrics (NFIQ2, MINDTCT), and notably,
matching experiments confirm strong privacy preservation, with no significant
evidence of identity leakage, confirming the strong privacy-preserving
properties of our synthetic datasets.

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging
central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable
and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces
barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework,
this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance
reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data
from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models
(3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against
expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation
reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via
Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic
modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38
dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians
qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical
meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow
integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71),
radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive
accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed
SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and
smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement
rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with
SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer
prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI
translation.

Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to
enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to
objective functions have been developed to further improve performance.
Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of
research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance.
Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery
image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative
representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that
these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification
metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized
selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to
class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean
average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For
example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet
specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple
re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon
contemporary results

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly
reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in
substantial computational overhead during both training and inference.
Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning
models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as
a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of
micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process
grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or
thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking"
process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by
reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more
certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,
theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at
inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during
inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the
value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable
controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any
dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration
and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our
proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base
instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the
gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any
training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced
by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

Abstract: The trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and their

feature versatility of the general-purpose Hiera encoder against the
segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight,
trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify
the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while
SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like
depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder
underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks
such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss
of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals
that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck.
Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a
quantitative foundation for designing efficient feature coding and adaptation
strategies for diverse downstream applications.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in
applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive
communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their
large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of
high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding,
which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative
by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although
recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable
success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive
decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware
tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density
information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded
adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive
decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive
coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate
improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

Abstract: Multimodal object detection improves robustness in chal- lenging conditions
by leveraging complementary cues from multiple sensor modalities. We introduce

FMCAF combines a frequency- domain filtering block (Freq-Filter) to suppress

to improve intermodal feature sharing. Unlike approaches tailored to specific
datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across
different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On
LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection),
FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50

Abstract: Planes are fundamental primitives of 3D sences, especially in man-made
environments such as indoor spaces and urban streets. Representing these planes
in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical
simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with
extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However,
even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar
regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we
propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and
well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene.
By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane
extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for
planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing
geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic
Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians
with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable
optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the
mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the
number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured
planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of
objects on supportive planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with no
sacrifice in rendering quality, the introduction of planar priors significantly
improves the geometric accuracy of the extracted meshes across various
baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable
Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several
low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods
often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This
issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded
information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two
primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent
modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional
latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a
novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models,
enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method
introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding,
i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors.
Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy
latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is
plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to
provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.

optimizes an LED light source's spectral profile to be minimally visible to the

method jointly considers the human visual system's sensitivity to visible
spectra, modern consumer camera sensors' spectral sensitivity, and narrowband
LEDs' ability to generate broadband spectra perceived as "white light"
(specifically, D65 illumination). To ensure imperceptibility, we employ
spectral modulation rather than intensity modulation. Unlike conventional
visible light communication, our approach enables watermark extraction at
standard low frame rates (30-60 fps). While the information transfer rate is
modest-embedding 128 bits within a 10-second video clip-this capacity is
sufficient for essential metadata supporting privacy protection and content
verification.

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for
synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the
performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on
perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and
insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To
address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that
directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using
off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level
guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to
reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel
space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the
classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,
this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample
generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively
combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We
perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the
effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by
GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part

(KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for
regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating
the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce
an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction
accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while
preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their
kinematic properties.

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples that subtly alter benign facial images, exposing blind spots in these
systems, as well as protecting user privacy. End-to-end FR systems first obtain
preprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the
similarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a
critical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,
we observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.
Our study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different
preprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice
of face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,
whereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively
minimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial
preprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the
unintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.
Based on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using
input transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks
by up to 27%. Our findings highlight the importance of preprocessing in FR
systems, and the need for its consideration towards improving the adversarial
generalisation of facial adversarial examples.

Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual
generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel
generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the
modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To
address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a
training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into
two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding,
followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens.
Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to
complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve
acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining
the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover,
observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic
information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose
Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to
tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high
frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and
text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining
comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1),

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during
real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD)
between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex
morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel
species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid
advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton
recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision
developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address
this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating
various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset
\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection
methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM
\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our
constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with
substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only
provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton
recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton
OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale,

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D head avatars are vital for telepresence, gaming, and VR.
However, most methods focus solely on facial regions, ignoring natural
hand-face interactions, such as a hand resting on the chin or fingers gently
touching the cheek, which convey cognitive states like pondering. In this work,
we present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the
non-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.
  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand
and face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we
propose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose
tracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.
Second, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,
making them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we
learn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand
interaction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of
PCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore,
inspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that
provides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration
artifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.
  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone.
Additionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a
synthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions. We show
that our method can capture better appearance and more accurate deforming
geometry of the face than SOTA surface reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify test-time samples into
either seen categories** -- available during training -- or novel ones, without
relying on label supervision. Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous
access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same
domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution
shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by
requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories,
without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD
method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains
and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error
accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework
that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic
simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we
augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting
while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we
introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes
pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A
unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic
contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates
compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter
further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves
state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently
outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can
process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant
visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many
methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing
approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the
guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this
work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by
introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token
pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our
hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens
and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.
Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves
performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal
accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these
gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and
inference latency.

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also
agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and
vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing
thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,
been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful
general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted
to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset
- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of
Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur
Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,
this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements
that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple
color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and
then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of
riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this
destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a
Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional
methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key
contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in
Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this
critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual
evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which
policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate
its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively
conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical
information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires
complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by
analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the
video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy
by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information,
such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper
reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented
with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy,
especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly
outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself.
This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly
effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for
real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously
adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously
learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively
mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class
imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we
propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for
endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum
Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy
strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized
Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and
intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and
balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected
Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward
new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets
demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods
across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework
effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis,
showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head
pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors
can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user,
potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be
detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based
spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and
spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract
generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention
mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments
conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop:
Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025'' and SiW dataset.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance
across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational
overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number
of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,
\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse
multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a
\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers
recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;
(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few
critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely
on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose
\emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of
vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It
significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across
diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable
guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its
intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval
(SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in
real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods
insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between
current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality
datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new
evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists
of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing
efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we
propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment
boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently
leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through
this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and
robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing
MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings.
Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and
evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically,
on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP,
2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method
establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging
video temporal grounding scenarios. Code is released at

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency,

propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal
feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness

temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve
detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for
non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data
augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies
frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby
mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on
FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA)
architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when
compared to SoTA.

performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and
spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate
formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and
re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across
sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also
encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate
schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity.
Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing
open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of
scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release
the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving

scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion
forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on
the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and
handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We
design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill
this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior
prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance,
while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our
approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open
Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance
improvements across both benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in
microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many
hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability,
complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that
tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature
aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis.
SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and
guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone
(EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are
fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve
complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained
in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification
heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization
to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is
enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks,
allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the
framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting
consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN
and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual
contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers
a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in
clinical workflows.

YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to identify a blue marker placed above the

identified location using two servomotors equipped with tilt-pan brackets. The
YOLO model achieves 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set consisting of annotated
images simulating surgical scenes with the blue spherical marker. By automating
the lighting process, this machine vision-based solution reduces physical
strain on surgeons, improves consistency in illumination, and supports improved

Abstract: In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised

tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as
Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence
across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures,
and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of
training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However,
evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open
challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure
Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective
dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and
empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance.
Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model
selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on
sixteen SSL methods across four benchmarks confirm that model selection
improves mIoU by $3.0\%$ on average with negligible computational cost.
Additionally, DSE regularization consistently mitigates the effects of dense
degradation. Code is available at

(DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable
stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by
causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On
simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically,
when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established
neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to
identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our
network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically
shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks
depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains
undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a
practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental

Abstract: In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object
detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend
against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods
against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack.
However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make
these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense
methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human
body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense
against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also
look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the
defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the
digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of
clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over
64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the

clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license
plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level

license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages
fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license
plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel
Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which
ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby
avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff
significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration
quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on
the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These
results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively
enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and
recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the
closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain
overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify
known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been
proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit,
or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing
approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model
with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR
method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted
logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to
its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with
the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the
NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top
three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two
datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single
dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish
animals. The code can be found

Abstract: Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic
range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction
(E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly
for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due
to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,
ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic
information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a
crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by
existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V
framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality
and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,
Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to
transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation
model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning
the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned
semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)
block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event
representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.
Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a
novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct
semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame
quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient
multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing
computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel
multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth,
edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared
encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task
Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving
task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on
a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time
deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception
systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments.
Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task
models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on
Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all
while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond
benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality
in spatial perception tasks.

However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long
videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this
work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs,
leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to
identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its
understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to
discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss;
2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent
understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for
lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between
efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:
achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected
without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities
under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising
privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical
evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through
extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a
systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition
datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our
methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic
data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity
separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and
benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic
samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard
benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of
synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic
datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and
94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including
CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available
alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our
findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while
maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even
though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control
for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish
synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative
alternative for facial recognition research.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting
potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on
facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains
growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However,
current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of
expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance
across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover,
most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather
than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new
facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates
multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion.
Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class
balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training
samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty.
Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based
feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

Abstract: Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects
simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance
grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable
actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with
image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from
exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the
applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this
study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only
transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to
enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative
mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and
denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered
egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that LoopTrans achieves consistent improvements
across all metrics on image and video benchmarks, even handling challenging
scenarios where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human
body.

Abstract: Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of

this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that
automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using
object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages
YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are
inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall.
To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with
assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system
distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind
spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for
horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to
data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral
monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and
stable management.

Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including
image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry,
and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning
based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong
performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric
changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to
challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to
prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent,
all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical
detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing
outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from
corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a
lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as
labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing
highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded
conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset
demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,
repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of
0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003
(correct matches).

which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In
addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net)
for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we
propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain
removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel
compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for
guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced
enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex
scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the
effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training
views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work
addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point
cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints
(regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal
that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable
performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield
only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's
primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse
views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed
points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it
fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i)
frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view
augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS
self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points,
compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii)
point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform
spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean
and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate
consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a
stronger initialization strategy. Code is available at

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models
for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing
occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which
inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place
classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic
and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,
a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,
powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception
module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and
enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range
perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a
State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based
forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic
queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically
devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and
efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves
state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning
tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the
advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and
efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in
images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision
applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without
a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available.
We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations.
First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry;
second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is
underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce
POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's
single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy
pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and
the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This
split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single
forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard
MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end
unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet
improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and
weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media,

concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital.
Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from
dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset
generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to
capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More
recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models
(LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to
handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled
prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations
into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured,
dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During
inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their
descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries
of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This
contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global
coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1
scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior
zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results
demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based
scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content

particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video

dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that
optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii)
training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation
models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and
performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video
compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and
alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent
state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video
generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations.
More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights,
Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for
video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and

monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up.
Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating
this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However,
existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on
single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for
longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert
labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation
architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the
MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We
introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module,
which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture
temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape
Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent
anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a
semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated
from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert
annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results
showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and
Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even
when trained on limited and noisy data.

Abstract: Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance
in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we
propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with
only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates
three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a
reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing
pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and
reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to
cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels
derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three
components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost
detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that
fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues
from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to
refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints,
enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets
and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to
supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods,
significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and
datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.

Abstract: Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded
Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of
static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets,
these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic
elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To
address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends
VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and
point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge
in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks:
accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while
geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we
propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic
information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for
pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in
dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation,
monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Abstract: With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection,
underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater
environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring,
camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately
segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional
camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated
datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in
underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater
camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which
comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level
annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance
Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM
includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module
(CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning,
effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater
environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is
proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from
camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged
objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature
Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries
of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands,
improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of
camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public
benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D generation from natural language offers significant potential to reduce
expert manual modeling efforts and enhance accessibility to 3D assets. However,
existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor
interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these
limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft,
a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we
propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes
complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby
facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial
relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents
hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine
procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and
interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate
ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and
semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further
show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and
user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive
applications.

Abstract: The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact
structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture
high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure.
However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components
from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and
error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine
learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our
approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point
clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a
railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting
major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale
datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced
training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This
automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure
model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in
structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized
single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class
models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts.
Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to
specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment
barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we
present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD,
which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly
extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less
is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple
element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based
framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across
diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the
foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks
demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities
(2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class,
inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial,
biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented
99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For
multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples
per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and
97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design,
computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a
unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection
applications.

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains

(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,
a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled
samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),
supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on
in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist
models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models
are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental
classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,
evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:
time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental
classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving
temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that
leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.
CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained
visual recognition and generation.

Abstract: Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping
these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire
management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their
inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based
segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1)
visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited
labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation
framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using
high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs
overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath
vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV
introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on
knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual
and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting
various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision
Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj
Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of
colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves
a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains
63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM
derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich
environments with scarce annotations.

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by
comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning
of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact
3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter
CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy
usage under realistic non-IID settings. Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy.
CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and
log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual
reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions
across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for
deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned
vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,
with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings
support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with
selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting
framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in
video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and
lifecycle-aware systems.

Abstract: 4D panoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is critical for highly
dynamic environments, such as evacuating dense crowds and autonomous driving in
complex scenarios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a
constrained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce
4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to
efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be
seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable
real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to
existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS
conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread.
The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to
extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures
timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and
compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate
4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and
nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex
scenes.

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing
models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original
content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying
physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing
an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with
nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on
instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,
how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we
introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across
eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for
most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We
further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses
VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.
Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics
from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most
of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a
challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and
proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive
content editing toward physically consistent realism.

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable
performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation
models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some
limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient
representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical
problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts
boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold
ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.
Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which
enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load
balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability
of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained
weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address
the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further
enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across
three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE
outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively
supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level
features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior
generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation
scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person
using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior
works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local
alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained
cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to
explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are
English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To
alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a
multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for
initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge.
Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation
Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and
modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module
enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing
the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a
multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality
heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all
multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have
made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness
remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D
objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including
novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors
struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D
open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary
expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We
propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect
any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We
introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation
models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for
class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating
complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal
mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal
features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing
open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement
compared to closed-world 3D detectors.

Abstract: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they
still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this
issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE
diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of
function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often
rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving
fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a
simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional
training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further
combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which
mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method
the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource
constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of
people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand
coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried
to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images;
however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack
of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient
data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease
that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing
type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required
features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the
previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each
image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting
features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final
classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from
each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top
performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On
the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen
patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap
of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in

Abstract: Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to
conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired
with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters,
revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches
based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell
flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to
automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell
clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell
clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel
staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study
introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and
identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis
strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups
by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT).
Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from
multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and
staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster
classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated
framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both
bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds
potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell
clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe
occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the
camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing
benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known
camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in
real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap
between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle
these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images
to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline
consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware
3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal
comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world
raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned
image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth,
enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different
focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal
critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on
unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline
components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction
performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud
initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for
developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in
banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable
progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline
signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as
variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade
performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature
forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that
is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using
three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental
pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another
employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several
behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive
superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that
the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the
shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward
robust, cross-domain signature verification.

Abstract: Recent high-performing image-to-video (I2V) models based on variants of the
diffusion transformer (DiT) have displayed remarkable inherent world-modeling
capabilities by virtue of training on large scale video datasets. We
investigate whether these models can generate realistic pedestrian movement
patterns in crowded public scenes. Our framework conditions I2V models on
keyframes extracted from pedestrian trajectory benchmarks, then evaluates their
trajectory prediction performance using quantitative measures of pedestrian
dynamics.

Abstract: We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference
sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation
performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness,
increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational
cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or
aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on
heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose
a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using
multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis
representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce
SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance
data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and
outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes,
with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation
while remaining lightweight.

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly
improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is
challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class
differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting
clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based
framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to
enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and
interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates
(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment
lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the
original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via
multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on
salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module
incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We
evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019
challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC
compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.
These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the
lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These
results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical
data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable
skin cancer classification model.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and
textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image
understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their
scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that
dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient
VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding
stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant
visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during
decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while
preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that
query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an
AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster
prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end
speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on
document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic
pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for
efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic
framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions
(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy
execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,
tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We
present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid
action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic
tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an
automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,
open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine
producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use
scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection
with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online
reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and
high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA
models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while
being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on
WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming
baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,
reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for
tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.
However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive
computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.
In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle
this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a
framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with
vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual
input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an
LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations
for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining
accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context
benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and
decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme
compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text
tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal
tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at
https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled
flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation
models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong
editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation
becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual
errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global
consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as
texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.
Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant
improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for
integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for
overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an
in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention
mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention
control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates
vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and
differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce
consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image
and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and
structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first
approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers
without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which
enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports
progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.

This work\nproposes a perception system for autonomous vehicles on unpaved roads and\noff-road environments, capable of navigating rough terrain without a predefined\ntrail. The Configurable Modular Segmentation Network (CMSNet) framework is\nproposed, facilitating different architectural arrangements. CMSNet\nconfigurations were trained to segment obstacles and trafficable ground on new\nimages from unpaved/off-road scenarios with adverse conditions (night, rain,\ndust). We investigated applying deep learning to detect drivable regions\nwithout explicit track boundaries, studied algorithm behavior under visibility\nimpairment, and evaluated field tests with real-time semantic segmentation. A\nnew dataset, Kamino, is presented with almost 12,000 images from an operating\nvehicle with eight synchronized cameras. The Kamino dataset has a high number\nof labeled pixels compared to similar public collections and includes images\nfrom an off-road proving ground emulating a mine under adverse visibility.

To this end,\nwe introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples\nperception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical,\ninterpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular,\ntraining-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract\ncritical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which\nare hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures.

As organ size differs\nby sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in\nlower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.\nWhile previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,\nno study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.\nThis study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC\nin an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied\nequally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants\nto ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary\nshift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,\naverage DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around\n0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,\nwith sex-based DSC differences close to zero.

The primary contribution of this study is a feature\nmatching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate\nintermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive\nviewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are\nreconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to\ntheir large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for\nscene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For\naccurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed\nby using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate\nhigh-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and\nground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature\nmatching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground\nimages, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences\nthrough intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the\nvalidation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature\nmatching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used\nmethods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can\nprovide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious\nincrease in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide\nenough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based\nscene rendering."}

Building upon this insight,\nwe integrate the diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into\na delicately designed dehazing network to provide instructions for image\ndehazing. Our DiffLI$^2$D avoids re-training diffusion models and iterative\nsampling process by effectively utilizing the informative representations\nderived from the pre-trained diffusion models, which also offers a novel\nperspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\nsuperior performance to existing image dehazing methods.

To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous\nsolutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress\nin this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the\nlack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field\ndeployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study\npresents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models\nfor deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of\nthis work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available\ndataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,\nderived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive\ncomparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO\narchitectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a\nhigh-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing\nplatforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the\nreal-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific\nmodel optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with\nGPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals\nthat smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and\nYOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and\ncomputational efficiency (FPS > 30).

An essential yet\nchallenging condition for effective VTON is pose control, which ensures\naccurate alignment of products with the user's body while supporting diverse\norientations for a more immersive experience. However, incorporating pose\nconditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting\nthe optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional\nparameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.\n  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the\nreference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex\nattention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this\npure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing\nperformance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional\nparameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose\nstitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose\npreservation and output realism. Additionally, we introduce a mixed-mask\ntraining strategy using fine-grained and bounding box masks, allowing the model\nto support flexible product integration across varied poses and conditions."}

This is the preview version; the\n  camera-ready version is still in preparation", "summary": "Existing video generation models excel at producing photo-realistic videos\nfrom text or images, but often lack physical plausibility and 3D\ncontrollability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel\nframework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical\nparameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that\nlearns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic,\nsand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics\nparameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point\ntrajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations\ngenerated by physics simulators. We enhance the diffusion model with a novel\nspatiotemporal attention block that emulates particle interactions and\nincorporates physics-based constraints during training to enforce physical\nplausibility. Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic,\nphysics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video\nmodels, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing\nmethods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

In this work, we introduce\nEditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing\nwithin a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and\nvideo, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to\nachieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and\nflexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and\ndurations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a\nscalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines\nthem with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore,\nwe present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video\nediting covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user\nstudies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nsurpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting\nemergent editing and generation abilities across modalities."}

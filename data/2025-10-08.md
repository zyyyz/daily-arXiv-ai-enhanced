Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

standard evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and
confusion matrices. Among the architectures tested, DenseNet201 delivered the
best results, achieving 99.33% accuracy with consistently strong metrics for
individual classes, particularly excelling in identifying Cutting Weevil and
Bacterial Canker. Moreover, ResNet152V2 and SeResNet152 provided strong
outcomes, whereas InceptionV3 and Xception exhibited lower performance in
visually similar categories like Sooty Mould and Powdery Mildew. The training

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a

we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior

training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video

take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent

paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient

face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying

representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of

we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning

difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort

research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced

standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.
These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,

metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves

active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong

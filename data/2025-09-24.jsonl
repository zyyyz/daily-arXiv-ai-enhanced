OOD detection relies on estimating a\nclassification model's uncertainty, which should increase for OOD samples.\nWhile existing research has largely focused on uncertainty quantification\nmethods, this work investigates the impact of the classification task itself.\nThrough experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four\nclassification tasks, we demonstrate that OOD detection performance\nsignificantly varies with the task, and that the best task depends on the\ndefined ID-OOD criteria; specifically, whether the OOD sample is due to: i) an\nimage characteristic shift or ii) an anatomical feature shift. Furthermore, we\nreveal that superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained\nprediction, underscoring the necessity to align task selection and uncertainty\nstrategies with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis."}

We identify\nthat these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an\nobject's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation,\nwe propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal\ninto (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we\nremove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly\nmask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong\ngeometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB\nimage conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are\nconsidered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry.

We conducted a benchmarking study\nusing three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and\nWikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were\ntested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2)\nclassification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five\nexemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the\nsame datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed\nthe ResNet50 baselines.

We identify two primary weaknesses\ncontributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces\nnoise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with\ndegraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded\nregions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective\nsupervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these\nchallenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual\nfoundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature\nrepresentation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene\ncorrespondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than\nrelying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we\ncreate synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These\ndatasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic\ncontext and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property.

We hypothesize that compositionality, the capacity\nto reason about object-attribute bindings and inter-object relationships, is\nkey to understanding longer captions. In this paper, we investigate the\ninteraction between compositionality and long-caption understanding, asking\nwhether training for one property enhances the other. We train and evaluate a\nrange of models that target each of these capabilities. Our results reveal a\nbidirectional relationship: compositional training improves performance on\nlong-caption retrieval, and training on long captions promotes\ncompositionality. However, these gains are sensitive to data quality and model\ndesign. We find that training on poorly structured captions, or with limited\nparameter updates, fails to support generalization. Likewise, strategies that\naim at retaining general alignment, such as freezing positional embeddings, do\nnot improve compositional understanding. Overall, we find that compositional\nunderstanding and long-caption understanding are intertwined capabilities that\ncan be jointly learned through training on dense, grounded descriptions.\nDespite these challenges, we show that models trained on high-quality,\nlong-caption data can achieve strong performance in both tasks, offering\npractical guidance for improving VLM generalization."}

To deal with these two challenges, a\nMulti-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage\naccident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for\nmulti-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale\nfeature post fusion, respectively.

In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant\nand relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously\nevolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques.

Using vision\nas the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge\nfor training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion,\nwithout the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by\ndecoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level\ncontrol that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model\non a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning\nto map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion\nprior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give\nrise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars.

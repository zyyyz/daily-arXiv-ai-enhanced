To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted\nusing a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally\nintroducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,\nconsisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for\nfacial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The\ncontinuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort\nassociated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief\nor even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style\ninduced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The\ncrossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but\ndoubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates\nthe importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.\nFacial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most\n(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.\nAmong the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4\nshowed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that\nfacial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived\nrisk in automated vehicles.

Since the approaches for general offensive content detection\nface a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions\ntailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a\nnovel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist\ncontent. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module\n(MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the\nContent-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive\ngating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on\nrelevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant\nfeatures. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual\nmodalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features\nsuch as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set\nof misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the\ntext. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the\npredictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has\nbeen evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and\n13,494 samples, respectively.

However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle\nexpressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in\nreal-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain\nadaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source\nmodel using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,\nstorage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging\nscenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled\ntarget data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods\nare not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.\nFurther, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions\ncan be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized\nfeature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image\ntranslation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent\nspace.

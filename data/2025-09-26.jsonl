This process is computationally intensive and\nincreases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly\nmethod for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over\nsignals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a\ndirect quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high\nuncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.\nTo test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements\nderived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and\nuse it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that\nNTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and\nsimple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.\nFurthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding\nonly the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection\nperformance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs\ninto the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or\nNTPs alone.

Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as\nknowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions\nas visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the\ncaptions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and\nLLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning\ncapabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank\nAugmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to\nconvert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples\nfor the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to\nexclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to\nunderstand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the\nmodel's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end\ntraining.

In this work, we\nconduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between\nperceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are\nnot necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment\nemerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while\ndiscriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their\nlearned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone\ninitializations for IQA models.

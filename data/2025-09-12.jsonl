Prior approaches face critical limitations: some\nrely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined\ntoolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single\nreasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate\nsteps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the\nuse of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address\nthis, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual\ninformation of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is\nthat this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation\nconsistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is\nunsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a\nlearnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved\nwith code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive\nframework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct\nvisual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with\nreinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a\ndata-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical\nhallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each\nstrategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode.

We propose a hybrid mechanistic\nlearning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a\nguided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically\nfeasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as\na system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics\nincluding radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These\nestimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that\naligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on\nthe BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices\nof in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our\nframework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity\nmetrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both\nclinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th\npercentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image\ngeneration in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time\npredictions that account for mechanistic priors."}

Existing benchmarks primarily test\nrecognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct\nanswer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for\ntrustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a\nbehavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new\nhallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible\nbut incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and\nattribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained\nscene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and\nprompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a\nrigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a \"None of the above\"\noption, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but\nalso to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized\nreasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights\nwith the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,\nHumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more\nrealistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings.

Using\nreconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the\ncoherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and\ngeneration processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,\na novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the\ndecoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained\nsemantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via\nreinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase\nto gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction\nloss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to\ngenerate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction\nquality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,\nwhere the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to\nleverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and\ngeneration fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first\nbenchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A\nsurprising \"aha moment\" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL\nprogresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while\nthe decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these\nintricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity."}

However, diffusion using this optimal\ndenoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to\ncapture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to\ncharacterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,\nproposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that\nresemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method\nhypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of\nconvolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence\nincorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we\npresent evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a\nstatistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of\nconvolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal\nparametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep\nneural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that\nthis locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural\nimage datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser\nthat better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior\nexpert-crafted alternative."}

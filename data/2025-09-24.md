Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as
critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and
accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing
CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to
observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential
for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a
barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an
explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp
segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of
1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust
segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of
0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96)
on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that
predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency
and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with
interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable,
trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer
prevention.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of vision loss among adults and a
major global health challenge, particularly in underserved regions. This study
presents PerceptronCARE, a deep learning-based teleophthalmology application
designed for automated diabetic retinopathy detection using retinal images. The
system was developed and evaluated using multiple convolutional neural
networks, including ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0, and SqueezeNet, to determine
the optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. The final
model classifies disease severity with an accuracy of 85.4%, enabling real-time
screening in clinical and telemedicine settings. PerceptronCARE integrates
cloud-based scalability, secure patient data management, and a multi-user
framework, facilitating early diagnosis, improving doctor-patient interactions,
and reducing healthcare costs. This study highlights the potential of AI-driven
telemedicine solutions in expanding access to diabetic retinopathy screening,
particularly in remote and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and
mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on
heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We
propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic
regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance
representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed
output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates
smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate
SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and
projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering
complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be
seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to
different network architectures and tasks.
  We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image
classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization.
Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods,
highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning
across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal
to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our
results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic
information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic
segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including
audio classification and time series anomaly detection. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/XiudingCai/SIM-pytorch.

Abstract: We study gradient inversion in the challenging single round averaged gradient
SAG regime where per sample cues are entangled within a single batch mean

inversion attack a novel label inference free framework that senses latent per
image signals by probing random data subsets. MAGIA objective integrates two
core innovations 1 a closed form combinatorial rescaling that creates a
provably tighter optimization bound and 2 a momentum based mixing of whole
batch and subset losses to ensure reconstruction robustness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MAGIA significantly outperforms advanced methods
achieving high fidelity multi image reconstruction in large batch scenarios
where prior works fail. This is all accomplished with a computational footprint
comparable to standard solvers and without requiring any auxiliary information.

Abstract: Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive
script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding
for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In
this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned
specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset
combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a
decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving
general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality,
expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR
systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing
open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing
a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results
highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs
and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich
languages like Arabic.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Monitoring ground displacement is crucial for urban infrastructure stability
and mitigating geological hazards. However, forecasting future deformation from
sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning
framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense
spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time,
the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this
forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural
Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to
simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the
generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful
machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO
regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate
that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and
spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this
task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models
often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of
our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of
ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of
spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Scrapbook framework, a novel methodology
designed to generate extensive datasets for probing the learned concepts of
artificial intelligence (AI) models. The framework focuses on fundamental
concepts such as object recognition, absolute and relative positions, and
attribute identification. By generating datasets with a large number of
questions about individual concepts and a wide linguistic variation, the
Scrapbook framework aims to validate the model's understanding of these basic
elements before tackling more complex tasks. Our experimental findings reveal
that, while contemporary models demonstrate proficiency in recognizing and
enumerating objects, they encounter challenges in comprehending positional
information and addressing inquiries with additional constraints. Specifically,
the MobileVLM-V2 model showed significant answer disagreements and plausible
wrong answers, while other models exhibited a bias toward affirmative answers
and struggled with questions involving geometric shapes and positional
information, indicating areas for improvement in understanding and consistency.
The proposed framework offers a valuable instrument for generating diverse and
comprehensive datasets, which can be utilized to systematically assess and
enhance the performance of AI models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With the increasing integration of multimodal AI systems in creative
workflows, understanding information loss in vision-language-vision pipelines
has become important for evaluating system limitations. However, the
degradation that occurs when visual content passes through textual
intermediation remains poorly quantified. In this work, we provide empirical
analysis of the describe-then-generate bottleneck, where natural language
serves as an intermediate representation for visual information. We generated
150 image pairs through the describe-then-generate pipeline and applied
existing metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and color distance) to measure information
preservation across perceptual, structural, and chromatic dimensions. Our
evaluation reveals that 99.3% of samples exhibit substantial perceptual
degradation and 91.5% demonstrate significant structural information loss,
providing empirical evidence that the describe-then-generate bottleneck
represents a measurable and consistent limitation in contemporary multimodal
systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Detailed structural building information is used to estimate potential damage
from hazard events like cyclones, floods, and landslides, making them critical
for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction. However, such
information is often unavailable in many small island developing states (SIDS)
in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean. To address this data gap, we
present an AI-driven workflow to automatically infer rooftop attributes from
high-resolution satellite imagery, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as our
case study. Here, we compare the utility of geospatial foundation models
combined with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models for
rooftop classification. Furthermore, we assess the impact of incorporating
additional training data from neighboring SIDS to improve model performance.
Our best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.83 for roof pitch and roof
material classification, respectively. Combined with local capacity building,
our work aims to provide SIDS with novel capabilities to harness AI and Earth
Observation (EO) data to enable more efficient, evidence-based urban
governance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models can follow text instructions
according to visual observations of the surrounding environment. This ability
to map multimodal inputs to actions is derived from the training of the VLA
model on extensive standard demonstrations. These visual observations captured
by third-personal global and in-wrist local cameras are inevitably varied in
number and perspective across different environments, resulting in significant
differences in the visual features. This perspective heterogeneity constrains
the generality of VLA models. In light of this, we first propose the
lightweight module VLA-LPAF to foster the perspective adaptivity of VLA models
using only 2D data. VLA-LPAF is finetuned using images from a single view and
fuses other multiview observations in the latent space, which effectively and
efficiently bridge the gap caused by perspective inconsistency. We instantiate
our VLA-LPAF framework with the VLA model RoboFlamingo to construct
RoboFlamingo-LPAF. Experiments show that RoboFlamingo-LPAF averagely achieves
around 8% task success rate improvement on CALVIN, 15% on LIBERO, and 30% on a
customized simulation benchmark. We also demonstrate the developed viewadaptive
characteristics of the proposed RoboFlamingo-LPAF through real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Endometriosis often leads to chronic pelvic pain and possible nerve
involvement, yet imaging the peripheral nerves remains a challenge. We
introduce Visionerves, a novel hybrid AI framework for peripheral nervous
system recognition from multi-gradient DWI and morphological MRI data. Unlike
conventional tractography, Visionerves encodes anatomical knowledge through
fuzzy spatial relationships, removing the need for selection of manual ROIs.
The pipeline comprises two phases: (A) automatic segmentation of anatomical
structures using a deep learning model, and (B) tractography and nerve
recognition by symbolic spatial reasoning. Applied to the lumbosacral plexus in
10 women with (confirmed or suspected) endometriosis, Visionerves demonstrated
substantial improvements over standard tractography, with Dice score
improvements of up to 25% and spatial errors reduced to less than 5 mm. This
automatic and reproducible approach enables detailed nerve analysis and paves
the way for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis-related neuropathy, as well
as other conditions with nerve involvement.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public health challenge, particularly
in countries with heterogeneous road conditions, mixed traffic flow, and
variable driving discipline, such as Pakistan. Reliable detection of unsafe
driving behaviours is a prerequisite for improving road safety, enabling
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and supporting data driven decisions
in insurance and fleet management. Most of existing datasets originate from the
developed countries with limited representation of the behavioural diversity
observed in emerging economies and the driver's face recording voilates the
privacy preservation. We present V-SenseDrive, the first privacy-preserving
multimodal driver behaviour dataset collected entirely within the Pakistani
driving environment. V-SenseDrive combines smartphone based inertial and GPS
sensor data with synchronized road facing video to record three target driving
behaviours (normal, aggressive, and risky) on multiple types of roads,
including urban arterials, secondary roads, and motorways. Data was gathered
using a custom Android application designed to capture high frequency
accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS streams alongside continuous video, with all
sources precisely time aligned to enable multimodal analysis. The focus of this
work is on the data acquisition process, covering participant selection,
driving scenarios, environmental considerations, and sensor video
synchronization techniques. The dataset is structured into raw, processed, and
semantic layers, ensuring adaptability for future research in driver behaviour
classification, traffic safety analysis, and ADAS development. By representing
real world driving in Pakistan, V-SenseDrive fills a critical gap in the global
landscape of driver behaviour datasets and lays the groundwork for context
aware intelligent transportation solutions.

Abstract: We present Qianfan-VL, a series of multimodal large language models ranging

innovative domain enhancement techniques. Our approach employs multi-stage
progressive training and high-precision data synthesis pipelines, which prove
to be critical technologies for enhancing domain-specific capabilities while
maintaining strong general performance. Qianfan-VL achieves comparable results
to leading open-source models on general benchmarks, with state-of-the-art
performance on benchmarks such as CCBench, SEEDBench IMG, ScienceQA, and
MMStar. The domain enhancement strategy delivers significant advantages in OCR
and document understanding, validated on both public benchmarks (OCRBench 873,
DocVQA 94.75%) and in-house evaluations. Notably, Qianfan-VL-8B and 70B
variants incorporate long chain-of-thought capabilities, demonstrating superior
performance on mathematical reasoning (MathVista 78.6%) and logical inference
tasks. All models are trained entirely on Baidu's Kunlun P800 chips, validating
the capability of large-scale AI infrastructure to train SOTA-level multimodal
models with over 90% scaling efficiency on 5000 chips for a single task. This
work establishes an effective methodology for developing domain-enhanced

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Dehazing involves removing haze or fog from images to restore clarity and
improve visibility by estimating atmospheric scattering effects. While deep
learning methods show promise, the lack of paired real-world training data and
the resulting domain gap hinder generalization to real-world scenarios. In this
context, physics-grounded learning becomes crucial; however, traditional
methods based on the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM) often fall short in
handling real-world complexities and diverse haze patterns. To solve this
problem, we propose HazeFlow, a novel ODE-based framework that reformulates ASM
as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Inspired by Rectified Flow (RF),
HazeFlow learns an optimal ODE trajectory to map hazy images to clean ones,
enhancing real-world dehazing performance with only a single inference step.
Additionally, we introduce a non-homogeneous haze generation method using
Markov Chain Brownian Motion (MCBM) to address the scarcity of paired
real-world data. By simulating realistic haze patterns through MCBM, we enhance
the adaptability of HazeFlow to diverse real-world scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that HazeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various real-world dehazing benchmark datasets.

Abstract: As medical diagnoses increasingly leverage multimodal data, machine learning

remaining robust to missing modalities. In this work, we propose a novel
multimodal learning framework that integrates enhanced modalities dropout and
contrastive learning to address real-world limitations such as modality
imbalance and missingness. Our approach introduces learnable modality tokens

unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations. We

Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in challenging and practical scenarios where only a
single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through
successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings
highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach
for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with
significant potential for real-world clinical applications. The code is

segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT)
families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified
testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important
observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective
architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to
this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based
models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based
counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on
large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to
training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may
rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model
architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when
trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be
segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to
both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these
findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for
segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false
negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further
validated on public datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for safe deployment
of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound amidst heterogeneous image
characteristics and clinical settings. OOD detection relies on estimating a
classification model's uncertainty, which should increase for OOD samples.
While existing research has largely focused on uncertainty quantification
methods, this work investigates the impact of the classification task itself.
Through experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four
classification tasks, we demonstrate that OOD detection performance
significantly varies with the task, and that the best task depends on the
defined ID-OOD criteria; specifically, whether the OOD sample is due to: i) an
image characteristic shift or ii) an anatomical feature shift. Furthermore, we
reveal that superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained
prediction, underscoring the necessity to align task selection and uncertainty
strategies with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Accurate visual localization from aerial views is a fundamental problem with
applications in mapping, large-area inspection, and search-and-rescue
operations. In many scenarios, these systems require high-precision
localization while operating with limited resources (e.g., no internet
connection or GNSS/GPS support), making large image databases or heavy 3D
models impractical. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to leveraging
orthographic geodata as an alternative paradigm, which is lightweight and
increasingly available through free releases by governmental authorities (e.g.,
the European Union). To fill this gap, we propose OrthoLoC, the first
large-scale dataset comprising 16,425 UAV images from Germany and the United
States with multiple modalities. The dataset addresses domain shifts between
UAV imagery and geospatial data. Its paired structure enables fair benchmarking
of existing solutions by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching,
allowing isolated evaluation of localization and calibration performance.
Through comprehensive evaluation, we examine the impact of domain shifts, data
resolutions, and covisibility on localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce a
refinement technique called AdHoP, which can be integrated with any feature
matcher, improving matching by up to 95% and reducing translation error by up
to 63%. The dataset and code are available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from
collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many
real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only
the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by
proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the
inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior
(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key
assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,
and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or
stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based
training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for
self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in
DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,
patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual
loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel
fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,
and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves
0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the
fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code
will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet

Abstract: Grounding vision--language models in low-resource languages remains
challenging, as they often produce fluent text about the wrong objects. This
stems from scarce paired data, translation pivots that break alignment, and
English-centric pretraining that ignores target-language semantics. We address
this with a compute-aware Bengali captioning pipeline trained on LaBSE-verified
EN--BN pairs and 110k bilingual-prompted synthetic images. A frozen MaxViT
yields stable visual patches, a Bengali-native mBART-50 decodes, and a
lightweight bridge links the modalities. Our core novelty is a tri-loss
objective: Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) aligns real and synthetic patch
descriptors using decoder cross-attention, InfoNCE enforces global
real--synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based OT ensures balanced fine-grained
patch correspondence. This PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy improves grounding, reduces
spurious matches, and drives strong gains on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR
27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14,
BERTScore-F1 75.40), outperforming strong CE baselines and narrowing the

Abstract: We present TinyBEV, a unified, camera only Bird's Eye View (BEV) framework
that distills the full-stack capabilities of a large planning-oriented teacher
(UniAD [19]) into a compact, real-time student model. Unlike prior efficient
camera only baselines such as VAD[23] and VADv2[7], TinyBEV supports the
complete autonomy stack 3D detection, HD-map segmentation, motion forecasting,
occupancy prediction, and goal-directed planning within a streamlined
28M-parameter backbone, achieving a 78% reduction in parameters over UniAD
[19]. Our model-agnostic, multi-stage distillation strategy combines
feature-level, output-level, and adaptive region-aware supervision to
effectively transfer high-capacity multi-modal knowledge to a lightweight BEV
representation. On nuScenes[4], Tiny-BEV achieves 39.0 mAP for detection, 1.08
minADE for motion forecasting, and a 0.32 collision rate, while running 5x
faster (11 FPS) and requiring only camera input. These results demonstrate that
full-stack driving intelligence can be retained in resource-constrained
settings, bridging the gap between large-scale, multi-modal perception-planning
models and deployment-ready real-time autonomy.

Abstract: Motion blur reduces the clarity of fast-moving objects, posing challenges for
detection systems, especially in racket sports, where balls often appear as
streaks rather than distinct points. Existing labeling conventions mark the
ball at the leading edge of the blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring
valuable motion cues correlated with velocity. This paper introduces a new
labeling strategy that places the ball at the center of the blur streak and
explicitly annotates blur attributes. Using this convention, we release a new
table tennis ball detection dataset. We demonstrate that this labeling approach
consistently enhances detection performance across various models. Furthermore,
we introduce BlurBall, a model that jointly estimates ball position and motion
blur attributes. By incorporating attention mechanisms such as
Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in ball detection. Leveraging blur not only improves detection accuracy
but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction, benefiting real-time
sports analytics.

Abstract: Running a large open-vocabulary (Open-vocab) detector on every video frame is
accurate but expensive. We introduce a training-free pipeline that invokes
OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to
intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors (MV). A simple 3x3
grid aggregation of motion vectors provides translation and uniform-scale
updates, augmented with an area-growth check and an optional single-class
switch. The method requires no labels, no fine-tuning, and uses the same prompt
list for all open-vocabulary methods. On ILSVRC2015-VID (validation dataset),
our approach (MVP) attains mAP@0.5=0.609 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds it remains close to framewise
OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 at 0.2/0.3 versus 0.784/0.780), reflecting that coarse
localization is largely preserved. Under the same keyframe schedule, MVP
outperforms tracker-based propagation (MOSSE, KCF, CSRT) at mAP@0.5. A
supervised reference (YOLOv12x) reaches 0.631 at mAP@0.5 but requires labeled
training, whereas our method remains label-free and open-vocabulary. These
results indicate that compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to
reduce detector invocations while keeping strong zero-shot coverage in videos.

Abstract: Advances in high dynamic range (HDR) lighting estimation from a single image
have opened new possibilities for augmented reality (AR) applications.
Predicting complex lighting environments from a single input image allows for
the realistic rendering and compositing of virtual objects. In this work, we
investigate the color robustness of such methods -- an often overlooked yet
critical factor for achieving visual realism. While most evaluations conflate
color with other lighting attributes (e.g., intensity, direction), we isolate
color as the primary variable of interest. Rather than introducing a new
lighting estimation algorithm, we explore whether simple adaptation techniques
can enhance the color accuracy of existing models. Using a novel HDR dataset
featuring diverse lighting colors, we systematically evaluate several
adaptation strategies. Our results show that preprocessing the input image with
a pre-trained white balance network improves color robustness, outperforming
other strategies across all tested scenarios. Notably, this approach requires
no retraining of the lighting estimation model. We further validate the
generality of this finding by applying the technique to three state-of-the-art
lighting estimation methods from recent literature.

Abstract: Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem,
facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However,
their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud,
underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the
core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of
critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition
(MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are
essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the
same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object
detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets,
a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this
paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field
detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction
with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot
detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment
in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a
hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts
demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore,
this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality
labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object
detection models tailored to institutional needs.

We evaluate ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, finding sharp

plausible but unsupported explanations.
  To address this gap, we introduce CHART NOISe(Chart Hallucinations, Answers,

combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and exam style multiple choice
questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. A key innovation is prompt
reverse inconsistency, where models contradict themselves when asked to confirm

benchmarking state of the art VLMs, exposing systematic vulnerabilities in
chart reasoning; (2) releasing CHART NOISe, the first dataset unifying
corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency; and (3) proposing baseline
mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection.
Together, these efforts establish a rigorous testbed for advancing robustness

Abstract: Four-dimensional MRI (4D-MRI) is an promising technique for capturing
respiratory-induced motion in radiation therapy planning and delivery.
Conventional 4D reconstruction methods, which typically rely on phase binning
or separate template scans, struggle to capture temporal variability,
complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. We introduce a
neural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth,
continuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing
the conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion
modeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the
Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical
representation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by
Transformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent
deformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers
demonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both
regular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and
bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method
significantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from
approximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to
just 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D
volume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at
any respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional
methods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation
therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment.

Abstract: Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking
of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems
in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics
applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot
perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking
methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their
performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects
that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking
methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom
dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p
resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors:
inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters
affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our
experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT
achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared
to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest
processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms.
However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit
significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values:
31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the
unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs.
Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial
improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking
benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving
tiny object tracking applications.

search yields robust crops with negligible overhead. On UCF101, MoCrop improves
accuracy or reduces compute. With ResNet-50, it delivers +3.5% Top-1 accuracy
at equal FLOPs (attention setting), or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer
FLOPs (efficiency setting). Applied to CoViAR, it reaches 89.2% Top-1 accuracy
at the original cost and 88.5% Top-1 accuracy while reducing compute from 11.6

Abstract: Coding images for machines with minimal bitrate and strong analysis
performance is key to effective edge-cloud systems. Several approaches deploy
an image codec and perform analysis on the reconstructed image. Other methods
compress intermediate features using entropy models and subsequently perform
analysis on the decoded features. Nevertheless, these methods both perform
poorly under low-bitrate conditions, as they retain many redundant details or
learn over-concentrated symbol distributions. In this paper, we propose a
Codebook-based Adaptive Feature Compression framework with Semantic
Enhancement, named CAFC-SE. It maps continuous visual features to discrete
indices with a codebook at the edge via Vector Quantization (VQ) and
selectively transmits them to the cloud. The VQ operation that projects feature
vectors onto the nearest visual primitives enables us to preserve more
informative visual patterns under low-bitrate conditions. Hence, CAFC-SE is
less vulnerable to low-bitrate conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method in terms of rate and accuracy.

also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy
over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging
benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with
nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively.
Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation
performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with
4.7$\times$ fewer #Params. Our MK-UNet also outperforms other recent
lightweight networks, such as MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet, with

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Research on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation of
remote sensing images has been extensively conducted. However, research on how
to achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is
inaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited.
Self-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many
high-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data.
Most existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more
supervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain
substantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This
limitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus
restricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel
pseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment
(DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and
propagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality
of newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on
confidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which
utilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a
small number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage
the diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular
distributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed
noise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby
generating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively
avoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels,
significantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the
model's performance in the target domain.

Abstract: In the field of machine learning, hyperbolic space demonstrates superior

Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe
approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently
normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the
embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose
embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ
the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor
to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball
instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss
and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and
classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under
few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic
space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors.
This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate
overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL
benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class
accuracies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the
target object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections.
However, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly
mask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not
explicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack
controllability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify
that these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an
object's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation,
we propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal
into (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we
remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly
mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong
geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB
image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are
considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide
learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven
objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to
remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new
structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their
associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks. The code is available at

Abstract: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) models play an important role
in various real-world applications. Recently, adversarial attacks against
NR-IQA models have attracted increasing attention, as they provide valuable
insights for revealing model vulnerabilities and guiding robust system design.
Some effective attacks have been proposed against NR-IQA models in white-box
settings, where the attacker has full access to the target model. However,
these attacks often suffer from poor transferability to unknown target models
in more realistic black-box scenarios, where the target model is inaccessible.
This work makes the first attempt to address the challenge of low
transferability in attacking NR-IQA models by proposing a transferable Signed
Ensemble Gaussian black-box Attack (SEGA). The main idea is to approximate the
gradient of the target model by applying Gaussian smoothing to source models
and ensembling their smoothed gradients. To ensure the imperceptibility of
adversarial perturbations, SEGA further removes inappropriate perturbations
using a specially designed perturbation filter mask. Experimental results on
the CLIVE dataset demonstrate the superior transferability of SEGA, validating
its effectiveness in enabling successful transfer-based black-box attacks
against NR-IQA models.

D-Markers through parameter-free multiplicative interactions. Through
systematic evaluation of 15 fusion strategies, we demonstrate that Hadamard
multiplicative fusion achieves optimal performance by enabling direct feature
interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed approach
establishes new state-of-the-art results for deep learning methods across four
benchmark datasets: UvA-NEMO (88.7 percent, +0.8), MMI (99.7 percent), SPOS
(98.5 percent, +0.7), and BBC (100 percent, +5.0). Comprehensive computational
analysis reveals 26 percent parameter reduction and simplified training
compared to multi-task alternatives, while feature visualization demonstrates
enhanced discriminative power through direct domain knowledge integration. The
framework's efficiency and effectiveness make it particularly suitable for
practical deployment in multimedia data mining applications that require
real-time affective computing capabilities.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans together with static scenes from monocular
videos remains difficult, especially under fast motion, where RGB frames suffer
from motion blur. Event cameras exhibit distinct advantages, e.g., microsecond
temporal resolution, making them a superior sensing choice for dynamic human
reconstruction. Accordingly, we present a novel event-guided human-scene
reconstruction framework that jointly models human and scene from a single
monocular event camera via 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, a unified set
of 3D Gaussians carries a learnable semantic attribute; only Gaussians
classified as human undergo deformation for animation, while scene Gaussians
stay static. To combat blur, we propose an event-guided loss that matches
simulated brightness changes between consecutive renderings with the event
stream, improving local fidelity in fast-moving regions. Our approach removes
the need for external human masks and simplifies managing separate Gaussian
sets. On two benchmark datasets, ZJU-MoCap-Blur and MMHPSD-Blur, it delivers
state-of-the-art human-scene reconstruction, with notable gains over strong
baselines in PSNR/SSIM and reduced LPIPS, especially for high-speed subjects.

Abstract: Real-time threat monitoring identifies threatening behaviors in video streams
and provides reasoning and assessment of threat events through explanatory
text. However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning
or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding
requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two
objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video
frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This
approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing
the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second,
an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to
filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time
responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a
Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and
logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment
reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and
UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the
crucial dimension of explainability.

Abstract: While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult
to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator,
Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and
aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the
factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object
identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color
block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection,
localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual
understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they
are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they
frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive
expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing
knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To
fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce
a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among
professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large
scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from
PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a
languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image
aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark,
PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual
understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates
clear advantages over existing models.

Abstract: This paper presents an advanced tumor segmentation framework for real-time
MRI-guided radiotherapy, designed for the TrackRAD2025 challenge. Our method
leverages the XMem model, a memory-augmented architecture, to segment tumors
across long cine-MRI sequences. The proposed system efficiently integrates
memory mechanisms to track tumor motion in real-time, achieving high
segmentation accuracy even under challenging conditions with limited annotated

preventing us from reporting precise quantitative results at this stage.
Nevertheless, From our preliminary impressions during development, the
XMem-based framework demonstrated reasonable segmentation performance and
satisfied the clinical real-time requirement. Our work contributes to improving
the precision of tumor tracking during MRI-guided radiotherapy, which is
crucial for enhancing the accuracy and safety of cancer treatments.

Abstract: Multi-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging super-resolution (MC-MRI SR) aims
to enhance low-resolution (LR) contrasts leveraging high-resolution (HR)
references, shortening acquisition time and improving imaging efficiency while
preserving anatomical details. The main challenge lies in maintaining
spatial-semantic consistency, ensuring anatomical structures remain
well-aligned and coherent despite structural discrepancies and motion between
the target and reference images. Conventional methods insufficiently model
spatial-semantic consistency and underuse frequency-domain information, which
leads to poor fine-grained alignment and inadequate recovery of high-frequency
details. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Semantic Consistent Model
(SSCM), which integrates a Dynamic Spatial Warping Module for inter-contrast
spatial alignment, a Semantic-Aware Token Aggregation Block for long-range
semantic consistency, and a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block for fine structure
restoration. Experiments on public and private datasets show that SSCM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while ensuring spatially and
semantically consistent reconstructions.

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce clinically
faithful reports from chest X-ray images. Prevailing work typically follows a
scale-driven paradigm, by multi-stage training over large paired corpora and
oversized backbones, making pipelines highly data- and compute-intensive. In
this paper, we propose Oracle-educated GRPO {OraPO) with a FactScore-based
reward (FactS) to tackle the RRG task under constrained budgets. OraPO enables
single-stage, RL-only training by converting failed GRPO explorations on rare
or difficult studies into direct preference supervision via a lightweight
oracle step. FactS grounds learning in diagnostic evidence by extracting atomic
clinical facts and checking entailment against ground-truth labels, yielding
dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards. Together, OraPO and FactS create a
compact and powerful framework that significantly improves learning efficiency
on clinically challenging cases, setting the new SOTA performance on the
CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 in F1) with 2--3 orders of magnitude less training
data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Multi-Style Fusion (AMSF), a reference-based
training-free framework that enables controllable fusion of multiple reference
styles in diffusion models. Most of the existing reference-based methods are
limited by (a) acceptance of only one style image, thus prohibiting hybrid
aesthetics and scalability to more styles, and (b) lack of a principled
mechanism to balance several stylistic influences. AMSF mitigates these
challenges by encoding all style images and textual hints with a semantic token
decomposition module that is adaptively injected into every cross-attention
layer of an frozen diffusion model. A similarity-aware re-weighting module then
recalibrates, at each denoising step, the attention allocated to every style
component, yielding balanced and user-controllable blends without any
fine-tuning or external adapters. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations
show that AMSF produces multi-style fusion results that consistently outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches, while its fusion design scales seamlessly to
two or more styles. These capabilities position AMSF as a practical step toward
expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar, measuring the range, azimuth,
elevation, and Doppler velocity of objects, is recognized for its
cost-effectiveness and robustness in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, its
point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone
application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have
provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt
explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera
fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the
sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to
coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose
MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via
multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the
point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling
comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components:
the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion
Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module.
Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image
instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel
Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D
image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts
pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image
features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP.
Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets
demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD
dataset.

Abstract: Inverting corrupted images into the latent space of diffusion models is
challenging. Current methods, which encode an image into a single latent
vector, struggle to balance structural fidelity with semantic accuracy, leading
to reconstructions with semantic drift, such as blurred details or incorrect
attributes. To overcome this, we introduce Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering
(PDLS), a novel, training-free framework built upon Rectified Flow models for
their stable inversion paths. PDLS decomposes the inversion process into two
complementary streams: a structural path to preserve source integrity and a
semantic path guided by a prompt. We formulate this dual guidance as an optimal
control problem and derive a closed-form solution via a Linear Quadratic
Regulator (LQR). This controller dynamically steers the generative trajectory
at each step, preventing semantic drift while ensuring the preservation of fine
detail without costly, per-image optimization. Extensive experiments on FFHQ-1K
and ImageNet-1K under various inversion tasks, including Gaussian deblurring,
motion deblurring, super-resolution and freeform inpainting, demonstrate that
PDLS produces reconstructions that are both more faithful to the original image
and better aligned with the semantic information than single-latent baselines.

Abstract: Neuroimaging is a ubiquitous tool for evaluating patients with neurological

risen steadily, placing significant strain on health systems, prolonging
turnaround times, and intensifying physician burnout \cite{Chen2017-bt,
Rula2024-qp-1}. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in
low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health
system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM)
serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical
MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a
hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI
features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included
30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic
disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental
lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0,
outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima
offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists,
and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and
MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups
and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times
for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative
potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven
healthcare.

Abstract: Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for
text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these
reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which
limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the
deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel
reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG),
which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to
reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is
to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities
during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative
abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse
understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated
image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing
instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step,
gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG
framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image
generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on
the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark. The project code:

Abstract: Monocular relative and metric depth estimation has seen a tremendous boost in

particular transformer based networks. As we start to see applications to the
domain of endoscopic images, there is still a lack of robust benchmarks and
high-quality datasets in that area. This paper addresses these limitations by
presenting a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art (metric and relative)
depth estimation models evaluated on real, unseen endoscopic images, providing
critical insights into their generalisation and performance in clinical
scenarios. Additionally, we introduce and publish a novel synthetic dataset
(EndoSynth) of endoscopic surgical instruments paired with ground truth metric
depth and segmentation masks, designed to bridge the gap between synthetic and
real-world data. We demonstrate that fine-tuning depth foundation models using
our synthetic dataset boosts accuracy on most unseen real data by a significant
margin. By providing both a benchmark and a synthetic dataset, this work
advances the field of depth estimation for endoscopic images and serves as an
important resource for future research. Project page, EndoSynth dataset and

Abstract: RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) aims to identify the most conspicuous
objects in a scene with the incorporation of depth cues. Existing methods
mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision
Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a
challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently,
state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling
long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to
RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate
cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and
Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel
components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture
multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive
fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable
cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in
both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent
performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.

Abstract: With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and
technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality
and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling
automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety
supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this
task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high
computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues,
we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a
Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism
(SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global
contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM
adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature
representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%,
respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with
baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an
effective balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without
categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels
through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated
three-stage framework for annotation-free open-set land-cover discovery,
segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery
and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2)
semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned
multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring
of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level
semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote
sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free,
the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery
without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and
interpretable solution for dynamic land-cover monitoring, showing strong
potential for automated cartographic updating and large-scale earth observation
analysis.

flora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It
is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana
Shield of South America, a region known to have one of the highest plant
diversities in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain
classification task where the training set consisted of several hundred
thousand herbarium sheets and a few thousand photos to allow learning a
correspondence between the two domains. In addition to the usual metadata
(location, date, author, taxonomy), the training data also includes the values
of 5 morphological and functional traits for each species. The test set
consisted exclusively of photos taken in the field. This article presents the

Abstract: Fusing cross-category objects to a single coherent object has gained

Moreover, progress in this field has been limited by the absence of a

\textbf{Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap)}, a simple yet highly effective
approach comprising two key components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping,
which fuses semantic attributes from different concepts through feature
manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism
guided by a balance evaluation score to ensure coherent synthesis.
Additionally, we introduce \textbf{Cross-category Object Fusion (COF)}, a
large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset built upon ImageNet-1K and
WordNet. COF includes 95 superclasses, each with 10 subclasses, enabling
451,250 unique fusion pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSwap
outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1

Abstract: Remote sensing visual grounding (RSVG) aims to localize objects in remote
sensing images based on free-form natural language expressions. Existing
approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their
applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage
generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on
expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework
that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for
zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key
stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain
cross-attention\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use
self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as
cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that
capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii)
Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model
(DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are
often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention
evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding
purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome
task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently
outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.

Abstract: Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across
non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable
progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or
cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain
models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models
often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress
identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose
an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual
semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically,
we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic
Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an
over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while
PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative
attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization
ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training
Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable
representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS)
to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update
Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the
pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively
focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive
experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets
demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting
superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization. The

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to
massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous
defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption
for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global
representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of
visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and
harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal
Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We
propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained
visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the
proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the
negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality
fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective
functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease
the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous
methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing
performance trained on poisoned datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current visual foundation models (VFMs) face a fundamental limitation in
transferring knowledge from vision language models (VLMs), while VLMs excel at
modeling cross-modal interactions through unified representation spaces,
existing VFMs predominantly adopt result-oriented paradigms that neglect the
underlying interaction processes. This representational discrepancy hinders
effective knowledge transfer and limits generalization across diverse vision
tasks. We propose Learning from Interactions (LFI), a cognitive-inspired
framework that addresses this gap by explicitly modeling visual understanding
as an interactive process. Our key insight is that capturing the dynamic
interaction patterns encoded in pre-trained VLMs enables more faithful and
efficient knowledge transfer to VFMs. The approach centers on two technical
innovations, Interaction Queries, which maintain persistent relational
structures across network layers, and interaction-based supervision, derived
from the cross-modal attention mechanisms of VLMs. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving 3.3
and 1.6mAP/2.4AP absolute gains on TinyImageNet classification and COCO
detection/segmentation respectively, with minimal parameter overhead and faster
convergence. The framework particularly excels in cross-domain settings,
delivering 2.4 and 9.3 zero-shot improvements on PACS and VLCS. Human
evaluations further confirm its cognitive alignment, outperforming
result-oriented methods by 2.7 times in semantic consistency metrics.

Abstract: RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent
objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal
modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects
remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the
extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the
zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for
RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that
generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs
dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive
cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter
kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose
a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general
optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid
prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and
box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating
with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains,
thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The
code and results of our method are available at:

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception is central to autonomous driving and robotics, yet raw
point clouds remain highly vulnerable to noise, occlusion, and adversarial
corruptions. Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and
reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world
conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention
autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from
multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning
semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial
structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to
stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing
limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more
robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where
CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to
reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion
framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with
any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the
research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert
models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage
capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the
instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however,
assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to
real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming
in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL
Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a
successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past
learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as
a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected
based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the
codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a
video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive
experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific
VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
proposed COLT.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable success in
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, reconstructing 3D scenes
from sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual
information, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D
representation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to
generative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in
under-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle
to ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and
implausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method
that fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for
sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement. At the core of FixingGS is our
distillation approach, which delivers more accurate and cross-view coherent
diffusion priors, thereby enabling effective artifact removal and inpainting.
In addition, we propose an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme that further
refines reconstructions in under-constrained regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FixingGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods with
superior visual quality and reconstruction performance. Our code will be
released publicly.

Abstract: We address the critical gap between the computational demands of
vision-language models and the possible ultra-low-bit weight precision
(bitwidth $\leq2$ bits) we can use for higher efficiency. Our work is motivated
by the substantial computational cost and memory requirements of VLMs, which
restrict their applicability in hardware-constrained environments. We propose
Bi-VLM, which separates model weights non-uniformly based on the Gaussian
quantiles. Our formulation groups the model weights into outlier (salient) and
multiple inlier (unsalient) subsets, ensuring that each subset contains a
proportion of weights corresponding to its quantile in the distribution. We
propose a saliency-aware hybrid quantization algorithm and use it to quantize
weights by imposing different constraints on the scaler and binary matrices
based on the saliency metric and compression objective. We have evaluated our
approach on different VLMs. For the language model part of the VLM, our Bi-VLM
outperforms the SOTA by 3%-47% on the visual question answering task in terms
of four different benchmarks and three different models. For the overall VLM,
our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 4%-45%. We also perform token pruning on the
quantized models and observe that there is redundancy of image tokens 90% - 99%
in the quantized models. This helps us to further prune the visual tokens to
improve efficiency.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for medical
image representation learning, particularly in settings with limited labeled
data. However, existing SSL methods often rely on complex architectures,
anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, which limit their
scalability and generalizability. More critically, these models are prone to
shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical
similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT
-- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable
Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization
into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This
constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while
suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation
transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both
classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and
shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate
DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its
robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: Deer-vehicle collisions represent a critical safety challenge in the United
States, causing nearly 2.1 million incidents annually and resulting in
approximately 440 fatalities, 59,000 injuries, and 10 billion USD in economic
damages. These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer
populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning
system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and
vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions.
Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal
deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation
demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision,
95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested
during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the
driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across
diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92
percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible
light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high
probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to
surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything
(CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency
consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This
research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle
collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for
developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While
diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data
memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to
improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical
Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion
models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs
of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs
lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation
process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical
datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and
$2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed
for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further
boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method
overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key
principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision
applications.

Abstract: Achieving high image quality for temporal frames in dynamic positron emission

wide range of medical image denoising tasks. In this paper, we propose a
model-based neural network for dynamic PET image denoising. The inter-frame
spatial correlation and intra-frame structural consistency in dynamic PET are
used to establish the kernel space-based multidimensional sparse (KMDS) model.
We then substitute the inherent forms of the parameter estimation with neural
networks to enable adaptive parameters optimization, forming the end-to-end
neural KMDS-Net. Extensive experimental results from simulated and real data
demonstrate that the neural KMDS-Net exhibits strong denoising performance for
dynamic PET, outperforming previous baseline methods. The proposed method may
be used to effectively achieve high temporal and spatial resolution for dynamic
PET. Our source code is available at

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has become a critical paradigm in modern
surgery, promoting patient recovery and reducing the burden on surgeons through
minimally invasive approaches. To fully realize its potential, however, a
precise understanding of the visual data generated during surgical procedures
is essential. Previous studies have predominantly focused on single-task
approaches, but real surgical scenes involve complex temporal dynamics and
diverse instrument interactions that limit comprehensive understanding.
Moreover, the effective application of multi-task learning (MTL) requires
sufficient pixel-level segmentation data, which are difficult to obtain due to
the high cost and expertise required for annotation. In particular, long-term
annotations such as phases and steps are available for every frame, whereas
short-term annotations such as surgical instrument segmentation and action
detection are provided only for key frames, resulting in a significant
temporal-spatial imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that combines optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation
with multi-task learning. optical flow estimated from annotated key frames is
used to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, thereby enriching sparse
spatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for
training. This integration improves both the accuracy and efficiency of
surgical scene understanding and, in turn, enhances the utility of RAS.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for
their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse
content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved
multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and
autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address
this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to
simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our
approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for
next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion
denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over
a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting
lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a
22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of
the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that
enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining
advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model
achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex
multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.

general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5,
can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers,
and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis:
(RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian
saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with
contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study
using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and
Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were
tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2)
classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five
exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the
same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed
the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset,
where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity
to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions
generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced
lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We
conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in
visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the
application of LLMs as metadata curation tools in digital humanities workflows,
suggesting future research on prompt optimization and the expansion of the
study to other classification strategies and models.

Abstract: Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision.
Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural
Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers.
Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of
images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image
representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer
that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a
hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on
non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the
latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best
neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph
Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack
the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction
method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized
Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies
key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold
reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable
mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the
neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding
methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows
tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds
are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the
model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms
state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark
dataset.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with
supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes
single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts
or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning
error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a
failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured
reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,
controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise
reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and
then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine
DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing
the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce
Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks
structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result
consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,
reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.
Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn
tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These
results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly
improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for
agents to learn from failure.

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of the Segment

paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning
framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize
point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by
representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode
both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker
agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's
segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these
disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep
Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During
inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt
sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks
without retraining. Extensive experiments show that Point Prompt Defender
effectively improves SAM's robustness and generalization, establishing a
flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based
segmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark designed to propel the
advancement of general-purpose, large-scale 3D vision models for remote sensing
imagery. While several datasets have been proposed within the realm of remote
sensing, many existing collections either lack comprehensive depth information
or fail to establish precise alignment between depth data and remote sensing
images. To address this deficiency, we present a visual Benchmark for 3D
understanding of Remotely Sensed images, dubbed RS3DBench. This dataset
encompasses 54,951 pairs of remote sensing images and pixel-level aligned depth
maps, accompanied by corresponding textual descriptions, spanning a broad array
of geographical contexts. It serves as a tool for training and assessing 3D
visual perception models within remote sensing image spatial understanding
tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a remotely sensed depth estimation model
derived from stable diffusion, harnessing its multimodal fusion capabilities,
thereby delivering state-of-the-art performance on our dataset. Our endeavor
seeks to make a profound contribution to the evolution of 3D visual perception
models and the advancement of geographic artificial intelligence within the
remote sensing domain. The dataset, models and code will be accessed on the

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-free
deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting method via event camera, dubbed DeblurSplat.
We address the motion-deblurring problem in two ways. First, we leverage the
pretrained capability of the dense stereo module (DUSt3R) to directly obtain
accurate initial point clouds from blurred images. Without calculating camera
poses as an intermediate result, we avoid the cumulative errors transfer from
inaccurate camera poses to the initial point clouds' positions. Second, we
introduce the event stream into the deblur pipeline for its high sensitivity to
dynamic change. By decoding the latent sharp images from the event stream and
blurred images, we can provide a fine-grained supervision signal for scene
reconstruction optimization. Extensive experiments across a range of scenes
demonstrate that DeblurSplat not only excels in generating high-fidelity novel
views but also achieves significant rendering efficiency compared to the SOTAs
in deblur 3D-GS.

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns arise from spectral aliasing between display pixel lattices

pose significant challenges for digital image demoir\'eing. We propose
Moir\'eNet, a convolutional neural U-Net-based framework that synergistically
integrates frequency and spatial domain features for effective artifact
removal. Moir\'eNet introduces two key components: a Directional
Frequency-Spatial Encoder (DFSE) that discerns moir\'e orientation via
directional difference convolution, and a Frequency-Spatial Adaptive Selector
(FSAS) that enables precise, feature-adaptive suppression. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Moir\'eNet achieves state-of-the-art performance
on public and actively used datasets while being highly parameter-efficient.
With only 5.513M parameters, representing a 48% reduction compared to ESDNet-L,
Moir\'eNet combines superior restoration quality with parameter efficiency,
making it well-suited for resource-constrained applications including
smartphone photography, industrial imaging, and augmented reality.

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) plays a critical role in multimodal machine
learning by effectively integrating audio and visual cues to precisely segment
objects or regions within visual scenes. Recent AVS methods have demonstrated
significant improvements. However, they overlook the inherent frequency-domain
contradictions between audio and visual modalities--the pervasively interfering
noise in audio high-frequency signals vs. the structurally rich details in
visual high-frequency signals. Ignoring these differences can result in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we rethink the AVS task from a deeper
perspective by reformulating AVS task as a frequency-domain decomposition and
recomposition problem. To this end, we introduce a novel Frequency-Aware
Audio-Visual Segmentation (FAVS) framework consisting of two key modules:
Frequency-Domain Enhanced Decomposer (FDED) module and Synergistic Cross-Modal
Consistency (SCMC) module. FDED module employs a residual-based iterative
frequency decomposition to discriminate modality-specific semantics and
structural features, and SCMC module leverages a mixture-of-experts
architecture to reinforce semantic consistency and modality-specific feature
preservation through dynamic expert routing. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our FAVS framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
benchmark datasets, and abundant qualitative visualizations further verify the
effectiveness of the proposed FDED and SCMC modules. The code will be released
as open source upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation by
improving efficiency and safety. Their success relies on 3D vision systems that
effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs
use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides
high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation,
and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is
time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather
or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding
techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby
improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in
AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's
temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on
the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various
configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance
metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results
demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and
its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data,
producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural
detail.

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is a crucial strategy in metallic surface
defect detection for mitigating the challenges posed by data scarcity. However,
its implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image
datasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive
self-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective
due to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle
defect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we
introduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm
that explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP
employs a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by
distilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture
defect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect
boxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable
this, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly
maps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images.
Additionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface
defect datasets for validation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSSP
consistently enhances performance across various settings, achieving up to a
10\% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4\% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to
ImageNet-based models. All code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly

Abstract: We introduce the first method for audio-driven universal photorealistic
avatar synthesis, combining a person-agnostic speech model with our novel
Universal Head Avatar Prior (UHAP). UHAP is trained on cross-identity
multi-view videos. In particular, our UHAP is supervised with neutral scan
data, enabling it to capture the identity-specific details at high fidelity. In
contrast to previous approaches, which predominantly map audio features to
geometric deformations only while ignoring audio-dependent appearance
variations, our universal speech model directly maps raw audio inputs into the
UHAP latent expression space. This expression space inherently encodes, both,
geometric and appearance variations. For efficient personalization to new
subjects, we employ a monocular encoder, which enables lightweight regression
of dynamic expression variations across video frames. By accounting for these
expression-dependent changes, it enables the subsequent model fine-tuning stage
to focus exclusively on capturing the subject's global appearance and geometry.
Decoding these audio-driven expression codes via UHAP generates highly
realistic avatars with precise lip synchronization and nuanced expressive
details, such as eyebrow movement, gaze shifts, and realistic mouth interior
appearance as well as motion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
is not only the first generalizable audio-driven avatar model that can account
for detailed appearance modeling and rendering, but it also outperforms
competing (geometry-only) methods across metrics measuring lip-sync accuracy,
quantitative image quality, and perceptual realism.

Abstract: Dendritic spines are key structural components of excitatory synapses in the
brain. Given the size of dendritic spines provides a proxy for synaptic
efficacy, their detection and tracking across time is important for studies of
the neural basis of learning and memory. Despite their relevance, large-scale
analyses of the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in 3D+time microscopy
data remain challenging and labor-intense. Here, we present a modular machine
learning-based pipeline designed to automate the detection, time-tracking, and
feature extraction of dendritic spines in volumes chronically recorded with
two-photon microscopy. Our approach tackles the challenges posed by biological
data by combining a transformer-based detection module, a depth-tracking
component that integrates spatial features, a time-tracking module to associate
3D spines across time by leveraging spatial consistency, and a feature
extraction unit that quantifies biologically relevant spine properties. We
validate our method on open-source labeled spine data, and on two complementary
annotated datasets that we publish alongside this work: one for detection and
depth-tracking, and one for time-tracking, which, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first data of this kind. To encourage future research, we release our
data, code, and pre-trained weights at
https://github.com/pamelaosuna/SynapFlow, establishing a baseline for scalable,
end-to-end analysis of dendritic spine dynamics.

Abstract: While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification
performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a
major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce.
Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual
models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper
proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM
and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the
set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a
confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier
directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies
high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual
representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier,
allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without
supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large
language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on
semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.

Abstract: Mirror-containing environments pose unique challenges for 3D reconstruction
and novel view synthesis (NVS), as reflective surfaces introduce view-dependent
distortions and inconsistencies. While cutting-edge methods such as Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical
scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing
solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but
often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These
reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details
and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction
in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset
featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror
masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in
reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of
3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary
viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and
recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that
ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and
training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich
environments.

Abstract: Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in
gastrointestinal surgery, and the laparoscopic approach is the gold standard
for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis. In addition to the
advantages of a significantly faster recovery and better cosmetic results, the
laparoscopic approach bears a higher risk of bile duct injury, which has a
significant impact on quality of life and survival. To avoid bile duct injury,
it is essential to improve the intraoperative visualization of the bile duct.
This work aims to address this problem by leveraging a deep-learning approach
for the localization of the biliary tract from white-light images acquired
during the surgical procedures. To this end, the construction and annotation of
an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm has been employed.
Besides classical data augmentation techniques, the paper proposes Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of a synthetic portion of the
training dataset. Experimental results have been discussed along with ethical

Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) of numerous organelle instances from
large-scale electron microscopy (EM) is a promising way to enable
annotation-efficient learning. Inspired by SAM, we propose a promptable
multitask framework, namely Prompt-DAS, which is flexible enough to utilize any
number of point prompts during the adaptation training stage and testing stage.
Thus, with varying prompt configurations, Prompt-DAS can perform unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) and weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA), as well
as interactive segmentation during testing. Unlike the foundation model SAM,
which necessitates a prompt for each individual object instance, Prompt-DAS is
only trained on a small dataset and can utilize full points on all instances,
sparse points on partial instances, or even no points at all, facilitated by
the incorporation of an auxiliary center-point detection task. Moreover, a
novel prompt-guided contrastive learning is proposed to enhance discriminative
feature learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on challenging benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing UDA, WDA,
and SAM-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have

largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the
challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering
extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation
MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and
navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark
consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a
challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs'
geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high
scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended
spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in
which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights
gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations
verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but
also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling
assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective
reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We
present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the
step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement
learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong
baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language
benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and
ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing
properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach

exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level
annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the
SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in
combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The
methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of
2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for
the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to
accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac anatomy in echocardiography is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. Yet echocardiography is prone to
deformation and speckle noise, causing frame-to-frame segmentation jitter. Even
with high accuracy in single-frame segmentation, temporal instability can
weaken functional estimates and impair clinical interpretability. To address
these issues, we propose DyL-UNet, a dynamic learning-based temporal
consistency U-Net segmentation architecture designed to achieve temporally
stable and precise echocardiographic segmentation. The framework constructs an
Echo-Dynamics Graph (EDG) through dynamic learning to extract dynamic
information from videos. DyL-UNet incorporates multiple Swin-Transformer-based
encoder-decoder branches for processing single-frame images. It further
introduces Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at the skip connections,
which uses EDG-encoded dynamic features and cardiac-phase cues to enforce
temporal consistency during segmentation. Extensive experiments on the CAMUS
and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets demonstrate that DyL-UNet maintains segmentation
accuracy comparable to existing methods while achieving superior temporal
consistency, providing a reliable solution for automated clinical
echocardiography.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for
image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in
sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing
diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo
ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur
heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present
WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object
reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain:
diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while
high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further
propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs
for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient,
leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360
and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality
while substantially reducing training time.

video benchmarks and achieves improvements of up to +11.6 J&F on MeViS, +1.4 on
Ref-YT-VOS, +3.3 on Ref-DAVIS and +4.1 on ReVOS using the same Sa2VA

Abstract: Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing
applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and
urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional
spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such
as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification,
and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat,
only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is
predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for
multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,
although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs
cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are
capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand
specialized multi-spectral signals.
  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new
multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist
multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the
multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to
inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions
into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe
strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing
benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy
adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential
for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to
easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate
their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities,
grounded in the specialized sensor data.

Abstract: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment
planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly
focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their
generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit
strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications
demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought
reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that
combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection,
segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level
lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like
diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal
training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering
reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks.
Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical
models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering
a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting
precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second
opinions.

Abstract: Traffic safety remains a critical global concern, with timely and accurate
accident detection essential for hazard reduction and rapid emergency response.
Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for
continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci-
dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot
capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and
describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus
minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include:
(1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA,
explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based
accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance
analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent
identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3)
Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object
detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for
instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and
explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an
F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with
enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and
recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal
metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of
integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their
applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which
requires consistent identification of points across video frames under
significant appearance changes, motion, and occlusion. We target the online
setting, i.e. tracking points frame-by-frame, making it suitable for real-time
and streaming applications. We extend our prior model Track-On into Track-On2,
a simple and efficient transformer-based model for online long-term tracking.
Track-On2 improves both performance and efficiency through architectural
refinements, more effective use of memory, and improved synthetic training
strategies. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full-sequence access or
iterative updates, our model processes frames causally and maintains temporal
coherence via a memory mechanism, which is key to handling drift and occlusions
without requiring future frames. At inference, we perform coarse patch-level
classification followed by refinement. Beyond architecture, we systematically
study synthetic training setups and their impact on memory behavior, showing
how they shape temporal robustness over long sequences. Through comprehensive
experiments, Track-On2 achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong
offline methods that exploit bidirectional context. These results highlight the
effectiveness of causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic
data as scalable solutions for real-world point tracking. Project page:

processing time over previous methods. Our rigorous calibration and hardware
synchronization enable using multiple spectra for object detection. All
collected data are annotated with metadata so they can be easily referenced

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling
energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN
inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy
constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud
co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is
often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these
issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that
jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a
learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs
a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on
output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and
Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To
demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16
backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data
transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing
end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a
negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables
practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent self-supervised stereo matching methods have made significant
progress, but their performance significantly degrades under adverse weather
conditions such as night, rain, and fog. We identify two primary weaknesses
contributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces
noise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with
degraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded
regions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective
supervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these
challenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual
foundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature
representation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene
correspondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than
relying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we
create synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These
datasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic
context and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this
knowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of
two key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse
weather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from
clean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under
adverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Codes are available at

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC), a lethal disease, begins with the growth of abnormal
mucosal cell proliferation called polyps in the inner wall of the colon. When
left undetected, polyps can become malignant tumors. Colonoscopy is the
standard procedure for detecting polyps, as it enables direct visualization and
removal of suspicious lesions. Manual detection by colonoscopy can be
inconsistent and is subject to oversight. Therefore, object detection based on
deep learning offers a better solution for a more accurate and real-time
diagnosis during colonoscopy. In this work, we propose YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based
polyp detection pipeline, trained using M2IoU loss, versatile data
augmentations and negative data to replicate real clinical situations. Our
pipeline outperformed existing methods for the Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp
datasets, achieving mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12
and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on the Kvasir-seg
dataset. The significant increase is achieved in mAP$_{50:95}$ score, showing
the precision of polyp detection. We show robustness based on polyp size and
precise location detection, making it clinically relevant in AI-assisted
colorectal screening.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a variety of real-world tasks. However, existing VLMs typically process visual
information by serializing images, a method that diverges significantly from
the parallel nature of human vision. Moreover, their opaque internal mechanisms
hinder both deeper understanding and architectural innovation. Inspired by the
dual-stream hypothesis of human vision, which distinguishes the "what" and
"where" pathways, we deconstruct the visual processing in VLMs into object
recognition and spatial perception for separate study. For object recognition,
we convert images into text token maps and find that the model's perception of
image content unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers,
beginning with attribute recognition and culminating in semantic
disambiguation. For spatial perception, we theoretically derive and empirically
verify the geometric structure underlying the positional representation in
VLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce an instruction-agnostic token
compression algorithm based on a plug-and-play visual decoder to improve
decoding efficiency, and a RoPE scaling technique to enhance spatial reasoning.
Through rigorous experiments, our work validates these analyses, offering a
deeper understanding of VLM internals and providing clear principles for
designing more capable future architectures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have
become the standard approach for learning discriminative vision-language
representations. However, these models often exhibit shallow language
understanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are
reinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap.
Additionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training
makes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy
concerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the
necessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free,
single-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image
retrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance
of VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this
paradigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of
the modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short
and long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration
on two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions
introduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess
generalisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality
benchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO,
containing diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin
subFlickr and subCOCO. Our vision-free retriever matches and often surpasses
traditional multimodal models. Importantly, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple retrieval and
compositionality benchmarks, with models as small as 0.3B parameters. Code is

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
binding visual and textual information, but understanding long, dense captions
remains an open challenge. We hypothesize that compositionality, the capacity
to reason about object-attribute bindings and inter-object relationships, is
key to understanding longer captions. In this paper, we investigate the
interaction between compositionality and long-caption understanding, asking
whether training for one property enhances the other. We train and evaluate a
range of models that target each of these capabilities. Our results reveal a
bidirectional relationship: compositional training improves performance on
long-caption retrieval, and training on long captions promotes
compositionality. However, these gains are sensitive to data quality and model
design. We find that training on poorly structured captions, or with limited
parameter updates, fails to support generalization. Likewise, strategies that
aim at retaining general alignment, such as freezing positional embeddings, do
not improve compositional understanding. Overall, we find that compositional
understanding and long-caption understanding are intertwined capabilities that
can be jointly learned through training on dense, grounded descriptions.
Despite these challenges, we show that models trained on high-quality,
long-caption data can achieve strong performance in both tasks, offering
practical guidance for improving VLM generalization.

Abstract: Accurate plant segmentation in thermal imagery remains a significant
challenge for high throughput field phenotyping, particularly in outdoor
environments where low contrast between plants and weeds and frequent
occlusions hinder performance. To address this, we present a framework that
leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and
GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal
images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures
of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop
and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as
five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using
various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few
labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the
weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline.
Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using
CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results
demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and
cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost
segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.

total CSF volume provided a potential biomarker for hydrocephalus evaluation,
achieving excellent performance in a predictive model (AUC = 0.87). The

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer
vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has
become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges
persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often
occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal
behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a
Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage
accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for
multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale
feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a
Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term,
mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture
is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature
processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under
causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network
fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a
comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show
that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale
feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation
studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how
the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion
and contextual interaction modeling.

Abstract: The rise of realistic digital face generation and manipulation poses
significant social risks. The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse
evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection
capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types
of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with
limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned
forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant
and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously
evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical
infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face
forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to
develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual
experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and
refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental
information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting,
we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the
established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the
orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the
training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and
manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

Abstract: What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar
when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated
based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare
videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been
thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on
broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video
understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural
language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video
Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by
computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key
semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video
similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video
retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new
benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains.
Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions
of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several
state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with
human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on
ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating
video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable
resource for advancing research in language-driven video understanding.

Abstract: Continuous human motion understanding remains a core challenge in computer
vision due to its high dimensionality and inherent redundancy. Efficient
compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion
dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework
with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while
preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense
motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates
reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment
observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic
dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming
the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%.
Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion
complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a
compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much
larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish
practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.

Abstract: A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing
confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While
radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI,
many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex
spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new
Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional
heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of
sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes
graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The
resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the
ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies
from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was
evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor
recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain
metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional
setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In
GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs
pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over
comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs
radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk
stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10%
improvement.

Abstract: The way we perceive the world fundamentally shapes how we move, whether it is
how we navigate in a room or how we interact with other humans. Current human
motion generation methods, neglect this interdependency and use task-specific
``perception'' that differs radically from that of humans. We argue that the
generation of human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception.
Consequently, in this work we present CLOPS, the first human avatar that solely
uses egocentric vision to perceive its surroundings and navigate. Using vision
as the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge
for training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion,
without the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by
decoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level
control that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model
on a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning
to map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion
prior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give
rise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars. For example, the
avatars walk such that they avoid obstacles present in their visual field.
These findings suggest that equipping avatars with human-like sensors,
particularly egocentric vision, holds promise for training avatars that behave
like humans.

Abstract: Despite steady progress in layout-to-image generation, current methods still
struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes. We
identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2)
overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both
qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these
factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we
introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of
overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are
biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their
effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging
conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark
featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different
levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on
complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a
curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for
more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging
scenarios. Project link: https://mlpc-ucsd.github.io/OverLayBench.

Abstract: The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications
ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods
rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not
always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have
shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the
applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with
the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that
aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an
explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for
multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with
a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this
approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated
by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D
scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our
framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input
video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective
solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a
pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a
3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several
inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent
on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and
introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions
or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new
multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with
voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D
voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature
matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables
adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding
more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and
enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent
Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach
establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with
denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in
wider communities. The video results, code and trained models are available on
our project page: https://lhmd.top/volsplat.

Abstract: Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution
from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and
flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a
learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that
ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence
required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the
demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow
Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source,
the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow
shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training
in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the
effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256),
equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while
introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

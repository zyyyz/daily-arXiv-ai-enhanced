While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown\nremarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to\ndiscriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically\ninvestigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard\nplanes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar\n(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical\nchallenge for reliable biometric assessment.\n  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available\nfetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified\nmulticenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated\nimages from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a\nself-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned\nfeatures were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,\nincluding linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two\ninitialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization\nfrom natural-image DINOv3 weights.\n  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed\nthose initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up\nto 20 percent.

Recent studies on\nmultimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising\nresults by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most\nexisting approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while\noverlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In\naddition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead\nto biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and\nConsistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis.

KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by\nvery high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the\nMassachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on\npreconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models\nwith significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space\nConditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient\nand accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into\nthe diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the\nstability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that\nKAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a\nscalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of\npreconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models."}

In this\ntask, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by\ncombining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising\ncooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods\nfocus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire\nvideo, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action\nrecognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized\nsequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action\nrecognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we\nintroduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast\nto previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial\ninformation, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in\nthe STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our\nmodule, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model\nthe relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments\nusing a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the\ncomparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure."}

Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial\nfeatures such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the\nvulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.\nUsing spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get\nillegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight\nCNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed\nrobust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster\nbiometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a\nnewly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos\ncollected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,\nwe provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack\ndetection approaches.

A Visual Token Compression Benchmark for Large Multimodal Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference\ninefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image\nencoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,\nhave shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented\nand inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and\nextensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench\nprovides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,\ncovering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs\n(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates\nsystem-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a\nholistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning\nis a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently\noutperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies\nsignificantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning\nratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe\nUniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on\nefficient multimodal modeling."}

Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks\nsuch as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding\nunderexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG\ncode as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We\nintroduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code\ngeneration: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic\nmeaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general\ncommonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric\nperception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel\nevaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered\nSVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,\nfrontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap\nbetween language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we\nintroduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)\nThinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines\nSVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply\nstructured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic\ncapacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities\nscore well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D\nreasoning.

This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through\n\"drawing to think\". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically\nchallenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning\nsteps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our\nevaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,\nannotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a\nunified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation\ninput: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with\nimage and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image\nclues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity\non our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under\ndifferent k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large\nlanguage models, including strongest private models as well as strong\nopen-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.\nHowever, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves\nconsistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and\ntasks.

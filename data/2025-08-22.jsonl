However, due to the extended\ntrajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN\nperformance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly\ndetailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which\ncould provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion\nspace for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV\nCollaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct\naltitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,\nand a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training\nand evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising\n13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with\ntarget-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps\nand an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's\ngeneralization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.\nTo consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV\ncollaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a\nmultimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the\nlow-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and\ntarget grounding.

Recently, several approaches have\nachieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and\nHD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale\noffline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable\ncomputational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a\nknowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models\nwith prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student\nmodel. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal\nknowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)\nparadigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with\nSD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with\nprior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge\ntransfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model.

To\naddress this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt\nRouting (MDPR) framework.

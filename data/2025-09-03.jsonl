Ali", "Anis Koubaa", "Bilel Benjdira"], "title": "Dual-Stage Global and Local Feature Framework for Image Dehazing", "comment": null, "summary": "Addressing the challenge of removing atmospheric fog or haze from digital\nimages, known as image dehazing, has recently gained significant traction in\nthe computer vision community. Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments."}

Existing token pruning\nmethods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics,\nleading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy\ndifferences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively\non visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy\nthat explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal\ninformational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning\nstrategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual\ntokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual\nmodalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained\ntokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the\nexpected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently\nwith a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nmaintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as\nLLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference\nspeed."}

To this end, we introduce aleatoric\nuncertainty modeling into the 3D hand pose estimation framework, aiming to\nachieve a better trade-off between modeling joint correlations and\ncomputational efficiency. We propose a novel parameterization that leverages a\nsingle linear layer to capture intrinsic correlations among hand joints.

With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem\nfrom a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer\nmodel that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given\nsequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures\nlong-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive\nfield for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and\ndecoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head\nemploys the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation.

By\nintroducing Gaussian quantization representation learning, our method\neffectively reduces overfitting while maintaining architecture complexity. On\nthis basis, we construct a multi source drone-based infrared image benchmark\ndataset for detection and use it to emphasize overfitting issues of large scale\narchitectures in few sample, drone-based diverse drone-based image\nreconstruction scenarios. To verify the efficacy of the method in mitigating\noverfitting, experiments are conducted on the constructed benchmark.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing super\nresolution approaches and significantly mitigates overfitting of large scale\narchitectures under complex conditions.

Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain\nnoise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature\nlearning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges,\nthis study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which\nintegrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy\nannotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically\nadjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening\nsupervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided\nLabel Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a\nKnowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to\nlocal details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated\nGSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of\nsimulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect\nreal-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy\nannotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen,\n8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise.

Unlike conventional distillation, this approach not\nonly enables the student model to absorb image fusion knowledge from the\nteacher model, but more importantly, allows the student to perform\nself-learning on more challenging samples to enhance its capabilities.\nParticularly, in our framework, a reinforcement learning agent explores and\nidentifies a more suitable training strategy for the student.The agent takes\nboth the student's performance and the teacher-student gap as inputs, which\nleads to the generation of challenging samples to facilitate the student's\nself-learning.

In live makeup transfer applications, it is critical to\nsynthesize temporally coherent results that accurately replicate fine-grained\nmakeup and preserve user's identity. However, existing methods often struggle\nto disentangle semitransparent cosmetics from skin tones and other identify\nfeatures, causing identity shifts and raising fairness concerns. Furthermore,\ncurrent methods lack real-time capabilities and fail to maintain temporal\nconsistency, limiting practical adoption. To address these challenges, we\ndecouple makeup transfer into two steps: transparent makeup mask extraction and\ngraphics-based mask rendering. After the makeup extraction step, the makeup\nrendering can be performed in real time, enabling live makeup try-on. Our\nmakeup extraction model trained on pseudo-ground-truth data generated via two\ncomplementary methods: a graphics-based rendering pipeline and an unsupervised\nk-means clustering approach. To further enhance transparency estimation and\ncolor fidelity, we propose specialized training objectives, including\nalpha-weighted reconstruction and lip color losses.

In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as\norgans, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often\nanisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In\nthis study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),\narguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific\nchallenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have\nproven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean\ndistances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional\nEncodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,\nbut they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),\na generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and\ndomain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against\ncommonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ\nclassification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in\nechocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can\nsignificantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on\nthe shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data. Finally,\nour proposed AFPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art PEs in all tested\nanisotropic settings.

Existing MRI image\nsegmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which\nis inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In\nthis situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI\nmodalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse,\nsuffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data\nheterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI\nimage segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves\nmultiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It\ndistinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and\ncross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel\nmodality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework\n(MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality\ndecoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the\nmodality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored\nand modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating,\ncorresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating,\nrespectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of\nheterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients.

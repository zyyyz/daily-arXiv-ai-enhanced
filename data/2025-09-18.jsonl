A tantalizing question is whether more sophisticated quantizers can\nimprove the current 3DGS compression methods with very little extra overhead\nand minimal change to the system. The answer is yes by replacing USQ with\nlattice vector quantization (LVQ). To better capture scene-specific\ncharacteristics, we optimize the lattice basis for each scene, improving LVQ's\nadaptability and R-D efficiency.

Recently,\nvirtual staining has emerged as a promising alternative that is faster,\ntissue-conserving, and environmentally friendly. However, existing virtual\nstaining methods face significant challenges in clinical applications,\nprimarily due to their reliance on well-aligned paired data. Obtaining such\ndata is inherently difficult because chemical staining processes can distort\ntissue structures, and a single tissue section cannot undergo multiple staining\nprocedures without damage or loss of information. As a result, most available\nvirtual staining datasets are either unpaired or roughly paired, making it\ndifficult for existing methods to achieve accurate pixel-level supervision. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a robust virtual staining framework\nfeaturing cascaded registration mechanisms to resolve spatial mismatches\nbetween generated outputs and their corresponding ground truth. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels across five datasets, achieving an average improvement of 3.2% on\ninternal datasets and 10.1% on external datasets. Moreover, in datasets with\nsubstantial misalignment, our approach achieves a remarkable 23.8% improvement\nin peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to baseline models. The exceptional\nrobustness of the proposed method across diverse datasets simplifies the data\nacquisition process for virtual staining and offers new insights for advancing\nits development."}

We hope it better allows researchers to follow the\nstate-of-the-art in this very dynamic area. Meanwhile, a growing number of\ntestbeds have boosted the evolution of general-purpose large language models.\nThus, this year's MARS2 focuses on real-world and specialized scenarios to\nbroaden the multimodal reasoning applications of MLLMs. Our organizing team\nreleased two tailored datasets Lens and AdsQA as test sets, which support\ngeneral reasoning in 12 daily scenarios and domain-specific reasoning in\nadvertisement videos, respectively. We evaluated 40+ baselines that include\nboth generalist MLLMs and task-specific models, and opened up three competition\ntracks, i.e., Visual Grounding in Real-world Scenarios (VG-RS), Visual Question\nAnswering with Spatial Awareness (VQA-SA), and Visual Reasoning in Creative\nAdvertisement Videos (VR-Ads). Finally, 76 teams from the renowned academic and\nindustrial institutions have registered and 40+ valid submissions (out of\n1200+) have been included in our ranking lists. Our datasets, code sets (40+\nbaselines and 15+ participants' methods), and rankings are publicly available\non the MARS2 workshop website and our GitHub organization page\nhttps://github.com/mars2workshop/, where our updates and announcements of\nupcoming events will be continuously provided."}

Recent studies have shown that abstract\nimages-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic\ninformation to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from\nsuch images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster\nimages. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and\ninvestigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different\nabstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction\nImage Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images\ngenerated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then\ntrain and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks\nincluding classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a\ncomprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations.

Recent studies have prioritized efficiency or accuracy\nenhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to\nsubstantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain\ngaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to\naddress the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection\nfor BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with\ntheir multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric\nspaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain\nadaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware\nteacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a\nReliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model.\nSpecifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth\npredictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty\nestimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are\nessential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the\ndomain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric\nembedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two\ndomains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential\nMoving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts\ninformed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in\nfour cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D\nobject detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\\% NDS and 9.5\\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night\nadaptation."}

Understanding Pruning Behaviors in STEP at High Resolutions", "comment": null, "summary": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in semantic\nsegmentation but are hindered by high computational and memory costs. To\naddress this, we propose STEP (SuperToken and Early-Pruning), a hybrid\ntoken-reduction framework that combines dynamic patch merging and token pruning\nto enhance efficiency without significantly compromising accuracy. At the core\nof STEP is dCTS, a lightweight CNN-based policy network that enables flexible\nmerging into superpatches. Encoder blocks integrate also early-exits to remove\nhigh-confident supertokens, lowering computational load. We evaluate our method\non high-resolution semantic segmentation benchmarks, including images up to\n1024 x 1024, and show that when dCTS is applied alone, the token count can be\nreduced by a factor of 2.5 compared to the standard 16 x 16 pixel patching\nscheme. This yields a 2.6x reduction in computational cost and a 3.4x increase\nin throughput when using ViT-Large as the backbone. Applying the full STEP\nframework further improves efficiency, reaching up to a 4x reduction in\ncomputational complexity and a 1.7x gain in inference speed, with a maximum\naccuracy drop of no more than 2.0%. With the proposed STEP configurations, up\nto 40% of tokens can be confidently predicted and halted before reaching the\nfinal encoder layer."}

However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and\nbenchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or\nkeyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise\navoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to\nredundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While\nthis trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like\nlecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and\nrequires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense\nVideo Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by\nreducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are\nalso limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore\npropose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed\nfor dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual\nTokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated\nTokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during\ntokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)\nSemantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions\nwithin a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.\nExperiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales\npositively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal\ninformation and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video\nunderstanding."}

Abstract: Accurate prediction of tumor trajectories under standard-of-care (SoC)
therapies remains a major unmet need in oncology. This capability is essential
for optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression.
Conventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to
capture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is
hence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically
simulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in
genomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care
Digital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies
reaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization
to predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit
exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures
stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated
on both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently
outperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in
predicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern
differentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for
patient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent
tumor dynamics estimation. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In an era dominated by video content, understanding its structure and
dynamics has become increasingly important. This paper presents a hybrid
framework that combines a distributed multi-GPU inference system with an
interactive visualization platform for analyzing celebrity dynamics in video
episodes. The inference framework efficiently processes large volumes of video
data by leveraging optimized ONNX models, heterogeneous batch inference, and
high-throughput parallelism, ensuring scalable generation of timestamped
appearance records. These records are then transformed into a comprehensive
suite of visualizations, including appearance frequency charts, duration
analyses, pie charts, co-appearance matrices, network graphs, stacked area
charts, seasonal comparisons, and heatmaps. Together, these visualizations
provide multi-dimensional insights into video content, revealing patterns in
celebrity prominence, screen-time distribution, temporal dynamics,
co-appearance relationships, and intensity across episodes and seasons. The
interactive nature of the system allows users to dynamically explore data,
identify key moments, and uncover evolving relationships between individuals.
By bridging distributed recognition with structured, visually-driven analytics,
this work enables new possibilities for entertainment analytics, content
creation strategies, and audience engagement studies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Marine plastic pollution is a pressing environmental threat, making reliable
automation for underwater debris detection essential. However, vision systems
trained on one dataset often degrade on new imagery due to domain shift. This
study benchmarks models for cross-domain robustness, training convolutional
neural networks - CNNs (MobileNetV2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (DeiT-Tiny, ViT-B16) on a labeled underwater dataset and then
evaluates them on a balanced cross-domain test set built from plastic-positive
images drawn from a different source and negatives from the training domain.
Two zero-shot models were assessed, CLIP ViT-L14 and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash,
that leverage pretraining to classify images without fine-tuning. Results show
the lightweight MobileNetV2 delivers the strongest cross-domain performance (F1
0.97), surpassing larger models. All fine-tuned models achieved high Precision
(around 99%), but differ in Recall, indicating varying sensitivity to plastic
instances. Zero-shot CLIP is comparatively sensitive (Recall around 80%) yet
prone to false positives (Precision around 56%), whereas Gemini exhibits the
inverse profile (Precision around 99%, Recall around 81%). Error analysis
highlights recurring confusions with coral textures, suspended particulates,
and specular glare. Overall, compact CNNs with supervised training can
generalize effectively for cross-domain underwater detection, while large
pretrained vision-language models provide complementary strengths.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present VLCAP, an Arabic image captioning framework that integrates
CLIP-based visual label retrieval with multimodal text generation. Rather than
relying solely on end-to-end captioning, VLCAP grounds generation in
interpretable Arabic visual concepts extracted with three multilingual
encoders, mCLIP, AraCLIP, and Jina V4, each evaluated separately for label
retrieval. A hybrid vocabulary is built from training captions and enriched
with about 21K general domain labels translated from the Visual Genome dataset,
covering objects, attributes, and scenes. The top-k retrieved labels are
transformed into fluent Arabic prompts and passed along with the original image
to vision-language models. In the second stage, we tested Qwen-VL and Gemini
Pro Vision for caption generation, resulting in six encoder-decoder
configurations. The results show that mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision achieved the
best BLEU-1 (5.34%) and cosine similarity (60.01%), while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL
obtained the highest LLM-judge score (36.33%). This interpretable pipeline
enables culturally coherent and contextually accurate Arabic captions.

Abstract: We present a controlled comparison of a convolutional neural network
(EfficientNet-B0) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) on SpaceNet under two
label-distribution regimes: a naturally imbalanced five-class split and a
balanced-resampled split with 700 images per class (70:20:10 train/val/test).
With matched preprocessing (224x224, ImageNet normalization), lightweight
augmentations, and a 40-epoch budget on a single NVIDIA P100, we report
accuracy, macro-F1, balanced accuracy, per-class recall, and deployment metrics
(model size and latency). On the imbalanced split, EfficientNet-B0 reaches 93%
test accuracy with strong macro-F1 and lower latency; ViT-Base is competitive
at 93% with a larger parameter count and runtime. On the balanced split, both
models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains
competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs
retain an efficiency edge. We release manifests, logs, and per-image
predictions to support reproducibility.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, remains a critical global challenge, as conventional
infrastructure-based measures often prove inadequate in dynamic urban
environments. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in
visual perception and reasoning, open new opportunities for proactive and
context-aware VRU protection. However, existing surveys on AI applications for
VRUs predominantly focus on detection, offering limited coverage of other
vision-based tasks that are essential for comprehensive VRU understanding and
protection. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent progress in
camera-based AI sensing systems for VRU safety, with an emphasis on
developments from the past five years and emerging research trends. We
systematically examine four core tasks, namely detection and classification,
tracking and reidentification, trajectory prediction, and intent recognition
and prediction, which together form the backbone of AI-empowered proactive
solutions for VRU protection in intelligent transportation systems. To guide
future research, we highlight four major open challenges from the perspectives
of data, model, and deployment. By linking advances in visual AI with practical
considerations for real-world implementation, this survey aims to provide a
foundational reference for the development of next-generation sensing systems
to enhance VRU safety.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Earth Observation Foundation Models (EOFMs) have exploded in prevalence as
tools for processing the massive volumes of remotely sensed and other earth
observation data, and for delivering impact on the many essential earth
monitoring tasks. An emerging trend posits using the outputs of pre-trained
models as 'embeddings' which summarize high dimensional data to be used for
generic tasks such as similarity search and content-specific queries. However,
most EOFM models are trained only on single modalities of data and then applied
or benchmarked by matching bands across different modalities. It is not clear
from existing work what impact diverse sensor architectures have on the
internal representations of the present suite of EOFMs. We show in this work
that the representation space of EOFMs is highly sensitive to sensor
architecture and that understanding this difference gives a vital perspective
on the pitfalls of current EOFM design and signals for how to move forward as
model developers, users, and a community guided by robust remote-sensing
science.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ecological monitoring is increasingly automated by vision models, yet opaque
predictions limit trust and field adoption. We present an inpainting-guided,
perturbation-based explanation technique that produces photorealistic,
mask-localized edits that preserve scene context. Unlike masking or blurring,
these edits stay in-distribution and reveal which fine-grained morphological
cues drive predictions in tasks such as species recognition and trait
attribution. We demonstrate the approach on a YOLOv9 detector fine-tuned for
harbor seal detection in Glacier Bay drone imagery, using
Segment-Anything-Model-refined masks to support two interventions: (i) object
removal/replacement (e.g., replacing seals with plausible ice/water or boats)
and (ii) background replacement with original animals composited onto new
scenes. Explanations are assessed by re-scoring perturbed images (flip rate,
confidence drop) and by expert review for ecological plausibility and
interpretability. The resulting explanations localize diagnostic structures,
avoid deletion artifacts common to traditional perturbations, and yield
domain-relevant insights that support expert validation and more trustworthy
deployment of AI in ecology.

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) stands as a cornerstone in medical image
analysis, playing a pivotal role in precise diagnostics, treatment planning,
and monitoring of various medical conditions. This paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic survey of MIS methodologies, bridging the gap
between traditional image processing techniques and modern deep learning
approaches. The survey encompasses thresholding, edge detection, region-based
segmentation, clustering algorithms, and model-based techniques while also
delving into state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), and the widely
adopted U-Net and its variants. Moreover, integrating attention mechanisms,
semi-supervised learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and
Transformer-based models is thoroughly explored. In addition to covering
established methods, this survey highlights emerging trends, including hybrid
architectures, cross-modality learning, federated and distributed learning
frameworks, and active learning strategies, which aim to address challenges
such as limited labeled datasets, computational complexity, and model
generalizability across diverse imaging modalities. Furthermore, a specialized
case study on lumbar spine segmentation is presented, offering insights into
the challenges and advancements in this relatively underexplored anatomical
region. Despite significant progress in the field, critical challenges persist,
including dataset bias, domain adaptation, interpretability of deep learning
models, and integration into real-world clinical workflows.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, early detection of wafer defects is critical
for product yield optimization. However, raw wafer data from wafer quality
tests are often complex, unlabeled, imbalanced and can contain multiple defects
on a single wafer, making it crucial to design clustering methods that remain
reliable under such imperfect data conditions. We introduce DECOR, a deep
clustering with orientation robustness framework that groups complex defect
patterns from wafer maps into consistent clusters. We evaluate our method on
the open source MixedWM38 dataset, demonstrating its ability to discover
clusters without manual tuning. DECOR explicitly accounts for orientation
variations in wafer maps, ensuring that spatially similar defects are
consistently clustered regardless of its rotation or alignment. Experiments
indicate that our method outperforms existing clustering baseline methods, thus
providing a reliable and scalable solution in automated visual inspection
systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of error correction in multi-class
classification of face images on unbalanced samples. The study is based on the
analysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional
states of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem
of class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others.
To solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with
an attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative
for emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is
trained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with
subsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training
stage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although
the degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are
worse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an
increase in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates
the promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the
search for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed
method can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in
tasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution.

Abstract: Dynamic Chart Generation (DCG) involves producing code-rendered animated
visualizations as charts. While recent advances in multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their capability on static chart
generation and comprehension, MLLMs' potential for handling dynamic chart
generation and understanding remains underexplored. To bridge this research
gap, we introduce DCG-Bench (Dynamic Chart Generation Benchmark), the first
benchmark evaluating MLLM's capability on dynamic chart generation tasks from
three dimensions: Simple Text-to-Chart, Detailed Text-to-Chart, and
Video-to-Chart tasks. We construct DCG-8K, a high-quality DCG dataset with
annotations covering instruction-code-video triplets and QA pairs for both code
and video evaluation. Based on DCG-8K, we explored a two-stage training recipe,
proposing Joint-Code-Visual Reward for group relative policy optimization to
construct expert MLLM Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B for the DCG task. Our benchmarking
result reveals shortcomings of existing MLLMs in the visual-to-chart task, and
our model beats the best open-sourced MLLM with an average 8.31% performance
gain across three tasks, and shows on par performance against proprietary
models with only 3B parameters, proving the effectiveness of our training
recipe. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modern monocular visual odometry methods typically combine pre-trained deep
learning components with optimization modules, resulting in complex pipelines
that rely heavily on camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning, and often
struggle in unseen real-world scenarios. Recent large-scale 3D models trained
on massive amounts of multi-modal data have partially alleviated these
challenges, providing generalizable dense reconstruction and camera pose
estimation. Still, they remain limited in handling long videos and providing
accurate per-frame estimates, which are required for visual odometry. In this
work, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed
effectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for
handcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera
calibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual
odometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by
extracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and
spatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion
without estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for
supervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless
integration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental
results demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits
substantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse
camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods
while running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse
problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that
could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely
ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search
algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a
manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate
and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based
guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image
reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse
problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring
tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that
our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance
of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior
performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward
gradient-based guidance algorithms. The code is available at

current landscape of sonar image datasets, seeking not only to catalog existing
resources but also to contextualize them, identify gaps, and provide a clear

publicly accessible datasets across various sonar modalities, including Side
Scan Sonar (SSS), Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS), Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS),
Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES), and Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar
(DIDSON). An analysis was conducted on applications such as classification,
detection, segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. This work focuses on
state-of-the-art advancements, incorporating newly released datasets. The
findings are synthesized into a master table and a chronological timeline,

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce provenance networks, a novel class of neural models designed to
provide end-to-end, training-data-driven explainability. Unlike conventional
post-hoc methods, provenance networks learn to link each prediction directly to
its supporting training examples as part of the model's normal operation,
embedding interpretability into the architecture itself. Conceptually, the
model operates similarly to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by
concrete exemplars weighted by relevance in the feature space. This approach
facilitates systematic investigations of the trade-off between memorization and
generalization, enables verification of whether a given input was included in
the training set, aids in the detection of mislabeled or anomalous data points,
enhances resilience to input perturbations, and supports the identification of
similar inputs contributing to the generation of a new data point. By jointly
optimizing the primary task and the explainability objective, provenance
networks offer insights into model behavior that traditional deep networks
cannot provide. While the model introduces additional computational cost and
currently scales to moderately sized datasets, it provides a complementary
approach to existing explainability techniques. In particular, it addresses
critical challenges in modern deep learning, including model opaqueness,
hallucination, and the assignment of credit to data contributors, thereby
improving transparency, robustness, and trustworthiness in neural models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to identify image- and pixel-level
anomalies using only normal training data, with wide applications such as
industrial inspection and medical analysis, where anomalies are scarce due to
privacy concerns and cold-start constraints. Existing methods, whether
reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based
(pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level
matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely
overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal
RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D
and RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models.
Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a
comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate
unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching
perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a
generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any
UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against
normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable
filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample,
mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in
enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art
results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) UAD
scenarios. Code and models will be released at

Abstract: Industrial diagrams such as piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are
essential for the design, operation, and maintenance of industrial plants.
Converting these diagrams into digital form is an important step toward
building digital twins and enabling intelligent industrial automation. A
central challenge in this digitalization process is accurate object detection.
Although recent advances have significantly improved object detection
algorithms, there remains a lack of methods to automatically evaluate the
quality of their outputs. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a
framework that employs Visual Language Models (VLMs) to assess object detection
results and guide their refinement. The approach exploits the multimodal
capabilities of VLMs to identify missing or inconsistent detections, thereby
enabling automated quality assessment and improving overall detection
performance on complex industrial diagrams.

MaskedSpatialViLT, focusing on full and masked object regions, respectively.
Additionally, SpatialEnsemble combines both approaches, achieving

Abstract: Structured illumination (SI) enhances image resolution and contrast by
projecting patterned light onto a sample. In two-phase optical-sectioning SI
(OS-SI), reduced acquisition time introduces residual artifacts that
conventional denoising struggles to suppress. Deep learning offers an
alternative to traditional methods; however, supervised training is limited by
the lack of clean, optically sectioned ground-truth data. We investigate
encoder-decoder networks for artifact reduction in two-phase OS-SI, using
synthetic training pairs formed by applying real artifact fields to synthetic
images. An asymmetrical denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a U-Net are trained on

Abstract: Integrating histopathology with spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides a
powerful opportunity to link tissue morphology with molecular function. Yet
most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable
genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological
programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced
Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents
transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By
encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning
them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces
dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal
correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node),
PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both
gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4
percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These
results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways
produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models,
advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep learning for medical imaging is hampered by task-specific models that
lack generalizability and prognostic capabilities, while existing 'universal'
approaches suffer from simplistic conditioning and poor medical semantic
understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce DuPLUS, a deep
learning framework for efficient multi-modal medical image analysis. DuPLUS
introduces a novel vision-language framework that leverages hierarchical
semantic prompts for fine-grained control over the analysis task, a capability
absent in prior universal models. To enable extensibility to other medical
tasks, it includes a hierarchical, text-controlled architecture driven by a
unique dual-prompt mechanism. For segmentation, DuPLUS is able to generalize
across three imaging modalities, ten different anatomically various medical
datasets, encompassing more than 30 organs and tumor types. It outperforms the
state-of-the-art task specific and universal models on 8 out of 10 datasets. We
demonstrate extensibility of its text-controlled architecture by seamless
integration of electronic health record (EHR) data for prognosis prediction,
and on a head and neck cancer dataset, DuPLUS achieved a Concordance Index (CI)
of 0.69. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks
and modalities from varying centers, establishing DuPLUS as a versatile and
clinically relevant solution for medical image analysis. The code for this work

Abstract: Real-time animal detection and segmentation in natural environments are vital
for wildlife conservation, enabling non-invasive monitoring through remote
camera streams. However, these tasks remain challenging due to limited
computational resources and the cryptic appearance of many species. We propose
a mobile-optimized two-stage deep learning framework that integrates a
Threading Detection Model (TDM) to parallelize YOLOv10-based detection and
MobileSAM-based segmentation. Unlike prior YOLO+SAM pipelines, our approach
improves real-time performance by reducing latency through threading. YOLOv10
handles detection while MobileSAM performs lightweight segmentation, both
executed concurrently for efficient resource use. On the cryptic Houbara
Bustard, a conservation-priority species, our model achieves mAP50 of 0.9627,
mAP75 of 0.7731, mAP95 of 0.7178, and a MobileSAM mIoU of 0.7421. YOLOv10
operates at 43.7 ms per frame, confirming real-time readiness. We introduce a
curated Houbara dataset of 40,000 annotated images to support model training
and evaluation across diverse conditions. The code and dataset used in this
study are publicly available on GitHub at

Abstract: While widespread, Transformers lack inductive biases for geometric symmetries
common in science and computer vision. Existing equivariant methods often
sacrifice the efficiency and flexibility that make Transformers so effective
through complex, computationally intensive designs. We introduce the Platonic
Transformer to resolve this trade-off. By defining attention relative to
reference frames from the Platonic solid symmetry groups, our method induces a
principled weight-sharing scheme. This enables combined equivariance to
continuous translations and Platonic symmetries, while preserving the exact
architecture and computational cost of a standard Transformer. Furthermore, we
show that this attention is formally equivalent to a dynamic group convolution,
which reveals that the model learns adaptive geometric filters and enables a
highly scalable, linear-time convolutional variant. Across diverse benchmarks
in computer vision (CIFAR-10), 3D point clouds (ScanObjectNN), and molecular
property prediction (QM9, OMol25), the Platonic Transformer achieves
competitive performance by leveraging these geometric constraints at no
additional cost.

Abstract: The generalization of deep neural networks to unknown domains is a major
challenge despite their tremendous progress in recent years. For this reason,
the dynamic area of domain generalization (DG) has emerged. In contrast to
unsupervised domain adaptation, there is no access to or knowledge about the
target domains, and DG methods aim to generalize across multiple different
unseen target domains. Domain generalization is particularly relevant for the
task semantic segmentation which is used in several areas such as biomedicine
or automated driving. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
rapidly evolving topic of domain generalized semantic segmentation. We cluster
and review existing approaches and identify the paradigm shift towards
foundation-model-based domain generalization. Finally, we provide an extensive
performance comparison of all approaches, which highlights the significant
influence of foundation models on domain generalization. This survey seeks to
advance domain generalization research and inspire scientists to explore new
research directions.

Abstract: Endoscopic procedures such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and
colonoscopy play a critical role in diagnosing and managing gastrointestinal
(GI) disorders. However, the documentation burden associated with these
procedures place significant strain on gastroenterologists, contributing to
inefficiencies in clinical workflows and physician burnout. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel automated report generation model that leverages
a transformer-based vision encoder and text decoder within a two-stage training
framework. In the first stage, both components are pre-trained on image/text
caption pairs to capture generalized vision-language features, followed by
fine-tuning on images/report pairs to generate clinically meaningful findings.
Our approach not only streamlines the documentation process but also holds
promise for reducing physician workload and improving patient care.

Abstract: We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D
hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone
navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to
map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model
that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth
image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate
and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train
the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set
of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data
by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and
use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D
sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label
872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the
SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate
SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and
show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled
data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to
correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests,
SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen
high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task
completion.

Abstract: AI-based talking-head videoconferencing systems reduce bandwidth by sending a
compact pose-expression latent and re-synthesizing RGB at the receiver, but
this latent can be puppeteered, letting an attacker hijack a victim's likeness
in real time. Because every frame is synthetic, deepfake and synthetic video
detectors fail outright. To address this security problem, we exploit a key
observation: the pose-expression latent inherently contains biometric
information of the driving identity. Therefore, we introduce the first
biometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video:
a pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent
identity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and
expression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit
identity swaps as the video is rendered. Our experiments on multiple
talking-head generation models show that our method consistently outperforms
existing puppeteering defenses, operates in real-time, and shows strong
generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Achieving streaming, fine-grained control over the outputs of autoregressive
video diffusion models remains challenging, making it difficult to ensure that
they consistently align with user expectations. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new
task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on
\emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and
SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating
video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and
rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we
observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space,
causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process;
\emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby
yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach,
\textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution
self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to
effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a
spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully
exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via
selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be
seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and
extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed computational pathology by providing

Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL), a flexible ensemble framework that
seamlessly integrates features from multiple FMs, preserving their
complementary strengths without requiring manual feature selection or extensive
task-specific fine-tuning. Across classification tasks in three cancer

consistently achieves superior or on-par performance relative to individual FMs
and established MIL methods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
By enabling efficient integration of heterogeneous FMs, GAS-MIL streamlines
model deployment for pathology and provides a scalable foundation for future
multimodal and precision oncology applications.

Abstract: Rapid naloxone delivery via drones offers a promising solution for responding
to opioid overdose emergencies (OOEs), by extending lifesaving interventions to
medically untrained bystanders before emergency medical services (EMS) arrive.
Recognizing the critical role of bystander situational awareness (SA) in
human-autonomy teaming (HAT), we address a key research gap in real-time SA
assessment by introducing the Drone-Assisted Naloxone Delivery Simulation
Dataset (DANDSD). This pioneering dataset captures HAT during simulated OOEs,
where college students without medical training act as bystanders tasked with
administering intranasal naloxone to a mock overdose victim. Leveraging this
dataset, we propose a video-based real-time SA assessment framework that
utilizes graph embeddings and transformer models to assess bystander SA in real
time. Our approach integrates visual perception and comprehension cues--such as
geometric, kinematic, and interaction graph features--and achieves
high-performance SA prediction. It also demonstrates strong temporal
segmentation accuracy, outperforming the FINCH baseline by 9% in Mean over
Frames (MoF) and 5% in Intersection over Union (IoU). This work supports the
development of adaptive drone systems capable of guiding bystanders
effectively, ultimately improving emergency response outcomes and saving lives.

Abstract: This study evaluates four open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

packaging images. The aim is to assess their ability to extract ingredient
lists and nutrition facts panels. Accurate OCR for packaging is important for
compliance and nutrition monitoring but is challenging due to multilingual
text, dense layouts, varied fonts, glare, and curved surfaces. A dataset of 231
products (1,628 images) was processed by all four models to assess speed and
coverage, and a ground truth subset of 113 images (60 products) was created for
accuracy evaluation. Metrics include Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error
Rate (WER), BLEU, ROUGE-L, F1, coverage, and execution time. On the ground
truth subset, Tesseract achieved the lowest CER (0.912) and the highest BLEU
(0.245). EasyOCR provided a good balance between accuracy and multilingual
support. PaddleOCR achieved near complete coverage but was slower because it
ran on CPU only due to GPU incompatibility, and TrOCR produced the weakest
results despite GPU acceleration. These results provide a packaging-specific
benchmark, establish a baseline, and highlight directions for layout-aware
methods and text localization.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced video understanding, but their
performance is limited by the number of input frames they can process. Existing
frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, often
fail to adapt to variations in information density or task complexity,
resulting in inefficiency and information loss. To address this, we present
FrameOracle, a lightweight and plug-and-play module that predicts both (1)
which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are
needed. FrameOracle is trained using a four-stage curriculum, with the first
three stages relying on weak proxy signals such as cross-modal similarity. In
the final stage, it leverages stronger supervision from a new dataset we
introduce, FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA collection to provide
keyframe annotations specifying the minimal set of frames required to answer
each question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks
demonstrate that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4
frames without any loss in accuracy. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it
reduces the input to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by
1.4%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable
video understanding.

Abstract: Manual identification of visual bugs in video games is a resource-intensive

supervised visual bug detection models offer a promising solution, their
reliance on extensive labeled datasets presents a significant challenge due to
the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. To overcome this limitation, we propose
a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method that effectively integrates both labeled
and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled samples from the target game
and diverse co-domain games, additionally incorporating unlabeled data to
enhance feature representation learning. This strategy maximizes the utility of
all available data, substantially reducing the dependency on labeled examples
from the specific target game. The developed framework demonstrates enhanced
scalability and adaptability, facilitating efficient visual bug detection
across various game titles. Our experimental results show the robustness of the
proposed method for game visual bug detection, exhibiting superior performance
compared to conventional baselines across multiple gaming environments.
Furthermore, CFT maintains competitive performance even when trained with only
50% of the labeled data from the target game.

Abstract: This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two
Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep
supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical
image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a
deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with
one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes
stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small
natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches
65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains
77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM
achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the
same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error
analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific
inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for
small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not
competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently
exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model
may allow it to improve greatly.

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially
learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a
task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current
FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on
limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation,
their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective
guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel
framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and
FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a
dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state
directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the
feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored
maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits
level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class
discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session
confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated
images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better
reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL
benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class
learning.

Abstract: Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and

Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and
insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent
need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present
MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety
violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces
three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000
vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining
regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a
clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant
clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and
(3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve
fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in
precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM
significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving
improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score
over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further
integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation
reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of
multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and

conditioning, our approach creates a robust classification framework. Our model
consists of multiple conditional modules, which aim to modulate the linear
projection of inputs using time embeddings and image covariate embeddings,
allowing the network to adapt its behavior dynamically throughout the diffusion
process. To address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models,
our implementation is cloud-based, enabling scalable and efficient processing.
Our strategy overcomes the shortcomings of conventional classification
approaches by leveraging diffusion models inherent capacity to effectively
understand complicated data distributions. We investigate important diffusion
characteristics, such as timestep schedulers, timestep encoding techniques,
timestep count, and architectural design changes, using a thorough ablation
study, and have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model
against the baseline models on a publicly available dataset. The proposed
diffusion model performs best in image-based accident detection with an

Abstract: RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment attractive objects by
combining RGB and thermal infrared images. To enhance performance, the Segment
Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance
convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high-

enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which
utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality
and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting
gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled
adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing
foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Fundamental experiments on
RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on scribble
supervised RGB-T SOD, fully supervised RGB-D SOD datasets and full-supervised
RGB-D rail surface defect detection all demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Abstract: Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to localize the target object
described by a natural language expression. Recent advances in vision-language
learning have led to significant performance improvements in REC tasks.
However, localizing extremely small objects remains a considerable challenge
despite its importance in real-world applications such as autonomous driving.
To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset and method for REC
targeting small objects. First, we present the small object REC (SOREC)
dataset, which consists of 100,000 pairs of referring expressions and
corresponding bounding boxes for small objects in driving scenarios. Second, we
propose the progressive-iterative zooming adapter (PIZA), an adapter module for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in
and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to
GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the
SOREC dataset. Our dataset, codes and pre-trained models are publicly available
on the project page.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Segmenting of clinically important retinal blood vessels into arteries and
veins is a prerequisite for retinal vessel analysis. Such analysis can provide
potential insights and bio-markers for identifying and diagnosing various
retinal eye diseases. Alteration in the regularity and width of the retinal
blood vessels can act as an indicator of the health of the vasculature system
all over the body. It can help identify patients at high risk of developing
vasculature diseases like stroke and myocardial infarction. Over the years,
various Deep Learning architectures have been proposed to perform retinal
vessel segmentation. Recently, attention mechanisms have been increasingly used
in image segmentation tasks. The work proposes a new Deep Learning approach for
artery-vein segmentation. The new approach is based on the Attention mechanism
that is incorporated into the WNet Deep Learning model, and we call the model
as Attention-WNet. The proposed approach has been tested on publicly available
datasets such as HRF and DRIVE datasets. The proposed approach has outperformed
other state-of-art models available in the literature.

Abstract: Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong
demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases
remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations
in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating
person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million
bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically
generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic
labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and
finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and
harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and
individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and
negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable
Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our
resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset
composition and downstream model bias.

Abstract: While deep learning methods for detecting informal settlements have already

recent pretrained neural networks. We compare two types of pretrained neural
networks for detecting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: 1. Generic networks
pretrained on large diverse datasets of unspecific images, 2. A specialized
network pretrained on satellite imagery. While the latter is more specific to
the target task, the former has been pretrained on significantly more images.
Hence, this research investigates whether task specificity or data volume
yields superior performance in urban informal settlement detection.

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant societal risks, motivating the development of
proactive defenses that embed adversarial perturbations in facial images to
prevent manipulation. However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive
defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach,
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug-and-play LoRA patch
into Deepfake generators to bypass state-of-the-art defenses. A learnable
gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents
gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature
Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align
with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we
present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a
complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security
vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of
fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses.
These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore
the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies. Our code is available at

Abstract: Given a query image, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is the task of retrieving
an image of the same place from a reference database with robustness to
viewpoint and appearance changes. Recent works show that some VPR benchmarks
are solved by methods using Vision-Foundation-Model backbones and trained on
large-scale and diverse VPR-specific datasets. Several benchmarks remain
challenging, particularly when the test environments differ significantly from
the usual VPR training datasets. We propose a complementary, unexplored source
of information to bridge the train-test domain gap, which can further improve
the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) VPR methods on such challenging
benchmarks. Concretely, we identify that the test-time reference set, the
"map", contains images and poses of the target domain, and must be available
before the test-time query is received in several VPR applications. Therefore,
we propose to perform simple Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF) of VPR models on
the map, boosting the SOTA (~2.3% increase on average for Recall@1) on these
challenging datasets. Finetuned models retain generalization, and RSF works
across diverse test datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization but doubles
the computational cost of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by requiring twice
the gradient calculations per optimization step. To mitigate this, we propose
Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly
accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can
be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order
gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the
SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the
growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed
to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves
state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network
architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a
speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various
challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization)
without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The
code is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/ajiaaa/ARSAM.

Abstract: The transparency of deep learning models is essential for clinical
diagnostics. Concept Bottleneck Model provides clear decision-making processes
for diagnosis by transforming the latent space of black-box models into
human-understandable concepts. However, concept-based methods still face
challenges in concept capture capabilities. These methods often rely on encode
features solely from the final layer, neglecting shallow and multiscale
features, and lack effective guidance in concept encoding, hindering
fine-grained concept extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Concept
Prompting and Aggregating (CoPA), a novel framework designed to capture
multilayer concepts under prompt guidance. This framework utilizes the
Concept-aware Embedding Generator (CEG) to extract concept representations from
each layer of the visual encoder. Simultaneously, these representations serve
as prompts for Concept Prompt Tuning (CPT), steering the model towards
amplifying critical concept-related visual cues. Visual representations from
each layer are aggregated to align with textual concept representations. With
the proposed method, valuable concept-wise information in the images is
captured and utilized effectively, thus improving the performance of concept
and disease prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CoPA
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets. Code is
available at https://github.com/yihengd/CoPA.

can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated
cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm
detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a
large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical
dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation
quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed
baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can
achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance
mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice
coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a
viable and powerful tool for enabling more efficient and accessible research on
large-scale medical datasets, fostering broader collaboration across the

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown near-expert performance in
segmenting complex medical tissues and tumors. However, existing models are
often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical
regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging,
particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are
critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation
architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs,
Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture
local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN
decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual
consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by
emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both
encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale
communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and
generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By
effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a
practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code
and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support

Abstract: Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart

automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with
polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ
polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop
a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly
collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based
model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve
78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong
performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score)
classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class
imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for
monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation involves learning mappings between source
domain and target domain in the absence of aligned or corresponding samples.
Score based diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
generative tasks. Their ability to approximate complex data distributions
through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) enables them to generate
high-fidelity and diverse outputs, making them particularly well-suited for
unpaired I2I settings. In parallel, contrastive learning provides a powerful
framework for learning semantic similarities without the need for explicit
supervision or paired data. By pulling together representations of semantically
similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, contrastive methods are
inherently aligned with the objectives of unpaired translation. Its ability to
selectively enforce semantic consistency at the feature level makes contrastive
learning particularly effective for guiding generation in unpaired scenarios.
In this work, we propose a time-dependent contrastive learning approach where a
model is trained with SimCLR by considering an image and its domain invarient
feature as a positive pair, enabling the preservation of domain-invariant
features and the discarding of domain-specific ones. The learned contrastive
model then guides the inference of a pretrained SDE for the I2I translation
task. We empirically compare Contrastive-SDE with several baselines across
three common unpaired I2I tasks, using four metrics for evaluation.
Constrastive-SDE achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art on several
metrics. Furthermore, we observe that our model converges significantly faster
and requires no label supervision or classifier training, making it a more
efficient alternative for this task.

Abstract: LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and
evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance
estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we
introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically
evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four
dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and
environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models
achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their
performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this
discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action
sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine
task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in
executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant
items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted
instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in
current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon
misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization
and comprehension. Our code is available at:

current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we
investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are
increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can
be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage
and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly
effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their
performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.

Abstract: We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm
that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled
transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that
leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{<SEG>} as prompt''. UGround
addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its
reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies
cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate
correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly
projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues
(\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which
comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as
Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic
sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer
layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision
model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer,
MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image
tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering
explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the
effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding
within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from
traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning
segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise
(empty target). All codes and models are publicly available at

Abstract: 4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene
representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions.
However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of
Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies
have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in
compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized
Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of
salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our
method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to
identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning
to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with
similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance
compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations,
further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms
recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while
maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a
significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new
possibilities for a wide range of applications. Our source code is available at

Abstract: Traditional object detection models are typically trained on a fixed set of
classes, limiting their flexibility and making it costly to incorporate new
categories. Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by
enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training.
Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available
ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for
open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint
variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across
domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary
representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial
imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive
image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and
ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to
align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView,
DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach.
Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16
mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when
compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance,
thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in
aerial applications.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieve excellent performance in

While knowledge distillation is a promising research direction for GAN
compression, effectively training a smaller student generator is challenging
due to the capacity mismatch between the student generator and the teacher
discriminator. In this work, we propose Student Discriminator Assisted
Knowledge Distillation (SDAKD), a novel GAN distillation methodology that
introduces a student discriminator to mitigate this capacity mismatch. SDAKD
follows a three-stage training strategy, and integrates an adapted feature map
distillation approach in its last two training stages. We evaluated SDAKD on
two well-performing super-resolution GANs, GCFSR and Real-ESRGAN. Our
experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over the baselines and SOTA GAN
knowledge distillation methods. The SDAKD source code will be made openly

complex prompting strategies. The extracted records were systematically imputed
and transformed into 3D representations using the Neural Head Avatar (NHA)
framework. The dataset includes 7,920 images generated from two head textures,
covering a broad spectrum of ocular conditions. The extraction method achieved
an overall accuracy of 91.92%, demonstrating its reliability for clinical

Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D scanning and reconstruction technologies,
dynamic digital human avatars based on 4D meshes have become increasingly
popular. A high-precision dynamic digital human avatar can be applied to
various fields such as game production, animation generation, and remote
immersive communication. However, these 4D human avatar meshes are prone to

high-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D
human meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their
corresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs). Equipped
with DHQA-4D dataset, we analyze the influence of different types of distortion
on human perception for textured dynamic 4D meshes and non-textured dynamic 4D
meshes. Additionally, we propose DynaMesh-Rater, a novel large multimodal model
(LMM) based approach that is able to assess both textured 4D meshes and
non-textured 4D meshes. Concretely, DynaMesh-Rater elaborately extracts
multi-dimensional features, including visual features from a projected 2D
video, motion features from cropped video clips, and geometry features from the
4D human mesh to provide comprehensive quality-related information. Then we
utilize a LMM model to integrate the multi-dimensional features and conduct a
LoRA-based instruction tuning technique to teach the LMM model to predict the
quality scores. Extensive experimental results on the DHQA-4D dataset
demonstrate the superiority of our DynaMesh-Rater method over previous quality
assessment methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Skin cancer classification remains a challenging problem due to high
inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and image noise in dermoscopic
images. To address these issues, we propose an improved ResNet-50 model
enhanced with Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF), which adaptively
integrates multi-scale semantic and surface features to improve feature
representation and reduce overfitting. The ResNet-50 model is enhanced with an
adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve more effective multi-scale feature
extraction and improve overall performance. Specifically, a dual-branch design
fuses high-level semantic and mid-level detail features, which are processed
through global average pooling and fully connected layers to generate adaptive
weights for weighted fusion, thereby strengthening feature learning and
reducing the impact of noise on classification. The method is evaluated on a
subset of the ISIC 2020 dataset containing 3297 benign and malignant skin
lesion images. Experimental results show that the proposed ASFF-based ResNet-50
achieves the best overall performance compared with 5 classic convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) models. The proposed model reached an accuracy of 93.18%
along with higher precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The improved
model achieves an AUC value of 0.9670 and 0.9717 in the P-R and ROC curve,
respectively. Then, the evaluation based on Grad-CAM further proved that the
improved model adaptively focuses on lesion-relevant regions while suppressing
irrelevant background information, thereby validating its enhanced feature
learning capability from a deep representation perspective. These findings
demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a more effective and efficient
solution for computer-aided skin cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Aims Late diagnosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) contributes
significantly to its high global mortality rate, with over 50\% of cases
detected at advanced stages and a 5-year survival rate below 50\% according to
WHO statistics. This study aims to improve early detection of OSCC by
developing a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates clinical,
radiological, and histopathological images using a weighted ensemble of
DenseNet-121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Material and Methods A
retrospective study was conducted using publicly available datasets
representing three distinct medical imaging modalities. Each modality-specific
dataset was used to train a DenseNet-121 CNN via transfer learning.
Augmentation and modality-specific preprocessing were applied to increase
robustness. Predictions were fused using a validation-weighted ensemble
strategy. Evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Results High validation accuracy was achieved for radiological (100\%) and
histopathological (95.12\%) modalities, with clinical images performing lower
(63.10\%) due to visual heterogeneity. The ensemble model demonstrated improved
diagnostic robustness with an overall accuracy of 84.58\% on a multimodal
validation dataset of 55 samples. Conclusion The multimodal ensemble framework
bridges gaps in the current diagnostic workflow by offering a non-invasive,
AI-assisted triage tool that enhances early identification of high-risk
lesions. It supports clinicians in decision-making, aligning with global
oncology guidelines to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), explainable image quality assessment (IQA) has
gradually become popular, aiming at providing quality-related descriptions and
answers of images. To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a
large-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality
perception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large
amount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and
redundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model.
To cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and
systematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning
dataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first
investigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different
sizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data
set randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than
training with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the
redundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly
sampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with
three stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and
cluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each
stage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for
explainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can
achieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10%
selected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing
computational costs while achieving better performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning
and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world
introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture,
generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data.
While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from
"acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action
module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible.
Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly
collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation
mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these
limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a
generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an
intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning
capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the
planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These
waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines
them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud
observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust
generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud
Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization
capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the
fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance

comprehensive understanding capabilities rather than relying on direct class
name generation. We enhance model performance through a novel attention
intervention technique. We also address a key limitation in existing datasets
by developing more comprehensive and precise class description benchmarks. We
validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation
across multiple fine-grained image classification benchmarks. Our proposed
method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach,

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy
conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details
critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from
handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image
fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and
segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving
questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical
study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical
filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants
(filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven
visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images.
Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance
on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals
when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how
VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate
qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment
with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these
results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods
and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves
autonomous perception in adverse weather.

Abstract: Human video generation is becoming an increasingly important task with broad

progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human
video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to
image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we
propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation.
It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs,
mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both
training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we
analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively
train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions,
conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a
camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically
selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and
reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the
T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use
cases.

Abstract: World-scale augmented reality (AR) applications need a ubiquitous 6DoF
localization backend to anchor content to the real world consistently across

public spaces in order to build their own Visual Positioning Systems (VPS).
These centralized VPS solutions fail to meet the needs of many future AR
applications -- they do not cover private indoor spaces because of privacy
concerns, regulations, and the labor bottleneck of updating and maintaining 3D
scans. In this paper, we present OpenFLAME, a federated VPS backend that allows
independent organizations to 3D scan and maintain a separate VPS service for
their own spaces. This enables access control of indoor 3D scans, distributed
maintenance of the VPS backend, and encourages larger coverage. Sharding of VPS
services introduces several unique challenges -- coherency of localization
results across spaces, quality control of VPS services, selection of the right
VPS service for a location, and many others. We introduce the concept of
federated image-based localization and provide reference solutions for managing
and merging data across maps without sharing private data.

Abstract: Automated tennis stroke analysis has advanced significantly with the

enhancing stroke classification accuracy and player performance evaluation.
Despite these advancements, existing systems often fail to connect
biomechanical insights with actionable language feedback that is both
accessible and meaningful to players and coaches. This research project
addresses this gap by developing a novel framework that extracts key
biomechanical features (such as joint angles, limb velocities, and kinetic
chain patterns) from motion data using Convolutional Neural Network Long
Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)-based models. These features are analyzed for
relationships influencing stroke effectiveness and injury risk, forming the
basis for feedback generation using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging
the THETIS dataset and feature extraction techniques, our approach aims to
produce feedback that is technically accurate, biomechanically grounded, and
actionable for end-users. The experimental setup evaluates this framework on
classification performance and interpretability, bridging the gap between
explainable AI and sports biomechanics.

Abstract: While Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across general video understanding benchmarks-particularly in video
captioning and descriptive tasks-they consistently underperform on tasks that
require fine-grained temporal understanding. This limitation arises due to the
lack of visual complexity and temporal nuance in current fine-tuning datasets,
leading these models to rely heavily on language-based reasoning rather than
truly understanding video dynamics. In this work, we propose TimeWarp, a
systematic method to create a targeted synthetic temporal dataset to fine-tune
the model's responses to encourage it to focus on the given input video. We
introduce a large-scale preference dataset, created using TimeWarp, that
captures intricate temporal dynamics often overlooked, grounding the model's
responses to visual and temporal information. We demonstrate that when our
method is applied to existing models, it significantly improves performance on
temporal understanding benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our
proposed datasets in advancing temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, resulting
in an absolute improvement in performance across seven benchmarks. Code is

Abstract: Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short
text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions.
Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source
literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To
this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical
captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that
longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format
captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance.
Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M
image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text
articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using
BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a
text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context
capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption
retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in
Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging
faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling
is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.

Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data
exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical
predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed).
However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may
follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled
dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the
unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a
known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution.
Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization
cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism
selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into
the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known
distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit
adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved
classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next
training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can
significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions.
Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further
improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to
maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples.
Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that
CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up
to \textbf{15.97\%} in accuracy. The code is available at

to find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of
images and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit
pixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We
evaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice
scores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\%$ fewer

Abstract: The emergence of fake news on short video platforms has become a new
significant societal concern, necessitating automatic video-news-specific
detection. Current detectors primarily rely on pattern-based features to
separate fake news videos from real ones. However, limited and less diversified
training data lead to biased patterns and hinder their performance. This
weakness stems from the complex many-to-many relationships between video
material segments and fabricated news events in real-world scenarios: a single
video clip can be utilized in multiple ways to create different fake
narratives, while a single fabricated event often combines multiple distinct
video segments. However, existing datasets do not adequately reflect such
relationships due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating large-scale
real-world data, resulting in sparse coverage and non-comprehensive learning of
the characteristics of potential fake news video creation. To address this
issue, we propose a data augmentation framework, AgentAug, that generates
diverse fake news videos by simulating typical creative processes. AgentAug
implements multiple LLM-driven pipelines of four fabrication categories for
news video creation, combined with an active learning strategy based on
uncertainty sampling to select the potentially useful augmented samples during
training. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AgentAug consistently improves the performance of short video fake news
detectors.

low-bit quantization while maintaining model accuracy is a challenging problem.
In this paper, we present a range estimation method to improve the quantization

classification tasks on the ResNet series models and Inception-v3 model. The
experimental results show that the proposed method has almost no loss of top-1
accuracy in 8-bit and 6-bit settings for image classifications, and the
accuracy of 4-bit quantization is also significantly improved. The code is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present MetaFind, a scene-aware tri-modal compositional retrieval
framework designed to enhance scene generation in the metaverse by retrieving
3D assets from large-scale repositories. MetaFind addresses two core
challenges: (i) inconsistent asset retrieval that overlooks spatial, semantic,
and stylistic constraints, and (ii) the absence of a standardized retrieval
paradigm specifically tailored for 3D asset retrieval, as existing approaches
mainly rely on general-purpose 3D shape representation models. Our key
innovation is a flexible retrieval mechanism that supports arbitrary
combinations of text, image, and 3D modalities as queries, enhancing spatial
reasoning and style consistency by jointly modeling object-level features
(including appearance) and scene-level layout structures. Methodologically,
MetaFind introduces a plug-and-play equivariant layout encoder ESSGNN that
captures spatial relationships and object appearance features, ensuring
retrieved 3D assets are contextually and stylistically coherent with the
existing scene, regardless of coordinate frame transformations. The framework
supports iterative scene construction by continuously adapting retrieval
results to current scene updates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the
improved spatial and stylistic consistency of MetaFind in various retrieval
tasks compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The prediction of solar flares is typically formulated as a binary
classification task, distinguishing events as either Flare (FL) or No-Flare
(NF) according to a specified threshold (for example, greater than or equal to
C-class, M-class, or X-class). However, this binary framework neglects the
inherent ordinal relationships among the sub-classes contained within each
category (FL and NF). Several studies on solar flare prediction have
empirically shown that the most frequent misclassifications occur near this
prediction threshold. This suggests that the models struggle to differentiate
events that are similar in intensity but fall on opposite sides of the binary
threshold. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function
that integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized
flare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This
approach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that
penalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the
prediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during
model optimization. By incorporating ordinal weighting into the loss function,
we aim to enhance the model's learning process by leveraging the ordinal
characteristics of the data, thereby improving its overall performance.

Abstract: Demoir\'eing aims to remove moir\'e artifacts that often occur in images.
While recent deep learning-based methods have achieved promising results, they
typically require substantial computational resources, limiting their
deployment on edge devices. Model quantization offers a compelling solution.
However, directly applying existing quantization methods to demoir\'eing models
introduces severe performance degradation. The main reasons are distribution
outliers and weakened representations in smooth regions. To address these
issues, we propose QuantDemoire, a post-training quantization framework
tailored to demoir\'eing. It contains two key components. **First}, we
introduce an outlier-aware quantizer to reduce errors from outliers. It uses
sampling-based range estimation to reduce activation outliers, and keeps a few
extreme weights in FP16 with negligible cost. **Second**, we design a
frequency-aware calibration strategy. It emphasizes low- and mid-frequency
components during fine-tuning, which mitigates banding artifacts caused by
low-bit quantization. Extensive experiments validate that our QuantDemoire
achieves large reductions in parameters and computation while maintaining
quality. Meanwhile, it outperforms existing quantization methods by over **4
dB** on W4A4. Code is released at:

Abstract: This work presents TV-LoRA, a novel method for low-dose sparse-view CT
reconstruction that combines a diffusion generative prior (NCSN++ with SDE
modeling) and multi-regularization constraints, including anisotropic TV and
nuclear norm (LoRA), within an ADMM framework. To address ill-posedness and
texture loss under extremely sparse views, TV-LoRA integrates generative and
physical constraints, and utilizes a 2D slice-based strategy with FFT
acceleration and tensor-parallel optimization for efficient inference.
Experiments on AAPM-2016, CTHD, and LIDC datasets with
$N_{\mathrm{view}}=8,4,2$ show that TV-LoRA consistently surpasses benchmarks
in SSIM, texture recovery, edge clarity, and artifact suppression,
demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability. Ablation studies confirm
the complementary effects of LoRA regularization and diffusion priors, while
the FFT-PCG module provides a speedup. Overall, Diffusion + TV-LoRA achieves
high-fidelity, efficient 3D CT reconstruction and broad clinical applicability
in low-dose, sparse-sampling scenarios.

Abstract: Topological mapping offers a compact and robust representation for
navigation, but progress in the field is hindered by the lack of standardized
evaluation metrics, datasets, and protocols. Existing systems are assessed
using different environments and criteria, preventing fair and reproducible
comparisons. Moreover, a key challenge - perceptual aliasing - remains
under-quantified, despite its strong influence on system performance. We
address these gaps by (1) formalizing topological consistency as the
fundamental property of topological maps and showing that localization accuracy
provides an efficient and interpretable surrogate metric, and (2) proposing the
first quantitative measure of dataset ambiguity to enable fair comparisons
across environments. To support this protocol, we curate a diverse benchmark
dataset with calibrated ambiguity levels, implement and release deep-learned
baseline systems, and evaluate them alongside classical methods. Our
experiments and analysis yield new insights into the limitations of current
approaches under perceptual aliasing. All datasets, baselines, and evaluation
tools are fully open-sourced to foster consistent and reproducible research in
topological mapping.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of event-based meshflow estimation, a
novel task that involves predicting a spatially smooth sparse motion field from
event cameras. To start, we review the state-of-the-art in event-based flow
estimation, highlighting two key areas for further research: i) the lack of
meshflow-specific event datasets and methods, and ii) the underexplored
challenge of event data density. First, we generate a large-scale
High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset, which showcases its superiority
by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720, handling dynamic
objects and complex motion patterns, and offering both optical flow and
meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works.
Besides, we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network, a
lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to
facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore, we upgrade
EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow, in which a
Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp
motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional
performance and runtime efficiency (30x faster) of our EEMFlow model compared
to the recent state-of-the-art flow method. As an extension, we expand HREM
into HREM+, a multi-density event dataset contributing to a thorough study of
the robustness of existing methods across data with varying densities, and
propose an Adaptive Density Module (ADM) to adjust the density of input event
data to a more optimal range, enhancing the model's generalization ability. We
empirically demonstrate that ADM helps to significantly improve the performance
of EEMFlow and EEMFlow+ by 8% and 10%, respectively. Code and dataset are

Abstract: Latest diffusion models have shown promising results in category-level 6D
object pose estimation by modeling the conditional pose distribution with depth
image input. The existing methods, however, suffer from slow convergence during
training, learning its encoder with the diffusion denoising network in
end-to-end fashion, and require an additional network that evaluates sampled
pose hypotheses to filter out low-quality pose candidates. In this paper, we
propose a novel pipeline that tackles these limitations by two key components.
First, the proposed method pretrains the encoder with the direct pose
regression head, and jointly learns the networks via the regression head and
the denoising diffusion head, significantly accelerating training convergence
while achieving higher accuracy. Second, sampling guidance via time-dependent
score scaling is proposed s.t. the exploration-exploitation trade-off is
effectively taken, eliminating the need for the additional evaluation network.
The sampling guidance maintains multi-modal characteristics of symmetric
objects at early denoising steps while ensuring high-quality pose generation at
final steps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including REAL275,
HouseCat6D, and ROPE, demonstrate that the proposed method, simple yet
effective, achieves state-of-the-art accuracies even with single-pose
inference, while being more efficient in both training and inference.

Abstract: This paper identifies a critical yet underexplored challenge in distilling
from multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the reasoning trajectories
generated by multiple drifting teachers exhibit concept drift, whereby their
reasoning distributions evolve unpredictably and transmit biases to the student
model, ultimately compromising its performance. To tackle this issue, we
pioneer a theoretical connection between concept drift and knowledge
distillation, casting the non-stationary reasoning dynamics from multiple MLLM
teachers as next-token prediction of multi-stream reasoning trajectories.Guided
by concept drift, we introduce the "learn, compare, critique" paradigm,
culminating in autonomous preference optimization (APO). Under the active
guidance of the teachers, the student model first learns and self-distils
preferred thinking by comparing multiple teachers. It then engages in critical
reflection over the drifting inference from teachers, performing concept
alignment through APO, ultimately yielding a robust, consistent, and
generalizable model.Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance
of consistency, robustness and generalization within knowledge distillation.
Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset, CXR-MAX (Multi-teachers
Alignment X-rays), comprising 170,982 distilled reasoning trajectories derived
from publicly accessible MLLMs based on MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public

Abstract: Conventional construction safety inspection methods are often inefficient as

large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety
inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However,
existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific
responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of
training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces
SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating
visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed
unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04,
precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield
offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural networks have revolutionized numerous fields, yet they remain
vulnerable to a critical flaw: the tendency to learn implicit biases, spurious
correlations between certain attributes and target labels in training data.
These biases are often more prevalent and easier to learn, causing models to
rely on superficial patterns rather than task-relevant features necessary for
generalization. Existing methods typically rely on strong assumptions, such as
prior knowledge of these biases or access to bias-conflicting samples, i.e.,
samples that contradict spurious correlations and counterbalance bias-aligned
samples, samples that conform to these spurious correlations. However, such
assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings. We propose BLADE
({B}ias-{L}inked {A}daptive {DE}biasing), a generative debiasing framework that
requires no prior knowledge of bias or bias-conflicting samples. BLADE first
trains a generative model to translate images across bias domains while
preserving task-relevant features. Then, it adaptively refines each image with
its synthetic counterpart based on the image's susceptibility to bias. To
encourage robust representations, BLADE aligns an image with its
bias-translated synthetic counterpart that shares task-relevant features but
differs in bias, while misaligning it with samples sharing the same bias. We
evaluate BLADE on multiple benchmark datasets and show that it significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it exceeds the closest baseline
by an absolute margin of around 18% on the corrupted CIFAR-10 dataset under the
worst group setting, establishing a new benchmark in bias mitigation and
demonstrating its potential for developing more robust deep learning models
without explicit supervision.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision;
however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and
trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is
crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not
only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading
features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their
explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by
reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly
concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which
regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that
integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple
instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an
instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning
over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our
model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and
produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring
annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance
across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies
between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade
visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent,
concept-level explanations.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video
synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due
to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate
this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique
that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods
often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring
their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by
modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and
introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies
dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration
across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56
times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and
Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models can synthesize high-quality images, their

introduce World-To-Image, a novel framework that bridges this gap by empowering
T2I generation with agent-driven world knowledge. We design an agent that
dynamically searches the web to retrieve images for concepts unknown to the
base model. This information is then used to perform multimodal prompt
optimization, steering powerful generative backbones toward an accurate
synthesis. Critically, our evaluation goes beyond traditional metrics,
utilizing modern assessments like LLMGrader and ImageReward to measure true
semantic fidelity. Our experiments show that World-To-Image substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic alignment and visual
aesthetics, achieving +8.1% improvement in accuracy-to-prompt on our curated
NICE benchmark. Our framework achieves these results with high efficiency in
less than three iterations, paving the way for T2I systems that can better
reflect the ever-changing real world. Our demo code is available

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have shown great promise in image generation, yet
they face a fundamental inefficiency stemming from their core component: a
vast, unstructured vocabulary of visual tokens. This conventional approach
treats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the
token embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic
similarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which
hinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve
this, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled
framework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the
codebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance
metric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying
manifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional
prediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a
beneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem
for the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive
experiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57%
and significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL
from 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly
competitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the
prediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable
generative modeling.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are continually evolving, with some efforts

accessibility. Improving accessibility broadens the application of neural
networks across a wider range of tasks, including the detection of eye
diseases. Early diagnosis of eye diseases and consulting an ophthalmologist can
prevent many vision disorders. Given the importance of this issue, various
datasets have been collected from the cornea to facilitate the process of
making neural network models. However, most of the methods introduced in the
past are computationally complex. In this study, we tried to increase the
accessibility of deep neural network models. We did this at the most
fundamental level, specifically by redesigning and optimizing the convolutional
layers. By doing so, we created a new general model that incorporates our novel
convolutional layer named ArConv layers. Thanks to the efficient performance of
this new layer, the model has suitable complexity for use in mobile phones and
can perform the task of diagnosing the presence of disease with high accuracy.
The final model we present contains only 1.3 million parameters. In comparison
to the MobileNetV2 model, which has 2.2 million parameters, our model
demonstrated better accuracy when trained and evaluated on the RfMiD dataset
under identical conditions, achieving an accuracy of 0.9328 versus 0.9266 on

operates on the principle that 3D can be regarded as a specialised sub-domain

Through a systemic study of scaling sequence-to-sequence generative neural

i) perform generative view synthesis without explicit 3D representations; ii)
generate any number of 6-DoF target views conditioned on any number of
reference views via a masked autoregressive framework; and iii) seamlessly
unify 3D and video modelling within a single decoder-only rectified flow
transformer. Within this unified framework, Kaleido leverages large-scale video
data for pre-training, which significantly improves spatial consistency and
reduces reliance on scarce, camera-labelled 3D datasets -- all without any
architectural modifications. Kaleido sets a new state-of-the-art on a range of
view synthesis benchmarks. Its zero-shot performance substantially outperforms
other generative methods in few-view settings, and, for the first time, matches
the quality of per-scene optimisation methods in many-view settings.

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation from contrast-enhanced MRI is essential for
diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, it remains
challenging due to limited annotated data, heterogeneous enhancement protocols,
and significant domain shifts across scanners and institutions. Traditional
image-to-image translation frameworks have made great progress in domain
generalization, but their application is not straightforward. For example,
Pix2Pix requires image registration, and cycle-GAN cannot be integrated
seamlessly into segmentation pipelines. Meanwhile, these methods are originally
used to deal with cross-modality scenarios, and often introduce structural
distortions and suffer from unstable training, which may pose drawbacks in our
single-modality scenario. To address these challenges, we propose CoSSeg-TTA, a
compact segmentation framework for the GED4 (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary
phase MRI) modality built upon nnU-Netv2 and enhanced with a semi-supervised
mean teacher scheme to exploit large amounts of unlabeled volumes. A domain
adaptation module, incorporating a randomized histogram-based style appearance
transfer function and a trainable contrast-aware network, enriches domain
diversity and mitigates cross-center variability. Furthermore, a continual
test-time adaptation strategy is employed to improve robustness during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms the nnU-Netv2 baseline, achieving superior Dice score and Hausdorff
Distance while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen domains under
low-annotation conditions.

clean accuracy than the state-of-the-art PatchCleanser, while maintaining
strong performance across varying patch sizes and locations. Our results
highlight the promise of combining interpretability with robustness and suggest
concept-driven defenses as a scalable strategy for securing machine learning
models against adversarial patch attacks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Sequential Visual Place Recognition (Seq-VPR) leverages transformers to
capture spatio-temporal features effectively; however, existing approaches
prioritize performance at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. In
practice, a transformer-based Seq-VPR model should be flexible to the number of
frames per sequence (seq-length), deliver fast inference, and have low memory
usage to meet real-time constraints. To our knowledge, no existing
transformer-based Seq-VPR method achieves both flexibility and efficiency. To
address this gap, we propose Adapt-STformer, a Seq-VPR method built around our
novel Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder (Recurrent-DTE), which uses an
iterative recurrent mechanism to fuse information from multiple sequential
frames. This design naturally supports variable seq-lengths, fast inference,
and low memory usage. Experiments on the Nordland, Oxford, and NuScenes
datasets show that Adapt-STformer boosts recall by up to 17% while reducing
sequence extraction time by 36% and lowering memory usage by 35% compared to
the second-best baseline.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image
editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring
physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This
capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this
paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a
video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images
as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large
pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but
also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal
consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that
explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target
frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing
trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable
transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to
avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate
ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for
contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical
plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit
will be released on the project page:

Abstract: Objective gait assessment in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is limited by the
absence of large, diverse, and clinically annotated motion datasets. We
introduce CARE-PD, the largest publicly available archive of 3D mesh gait data
for PD, and the first multi-site collection spanning 9 cohorts from 8 clinical
centers. All recordings (RGB video or motion capture) are converted into
anonymized SMPL meshes via a harmonized preprocessing pipeline. CARE-PD
supports two key benchmarks: supervised clinical score prediction (estimating
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS, gait scores) and unsupervised
motion pretext tasks (2D-to-3D keypoint lifting and full-body 3D
reconstruction). Clinical prediction is evaluated under four generalization
protocols: within-dataset, cross-dataset, leave-one-dataset-out, and
multi-dataset in-domain adaptation. To assess clinical relevance, we compare
state-of-the-art motion encoders with a traditional gait-feature baseline,
finding that encoders consistently outperform handcrafted features. Pretraining
on CARE-PD reduces MPJPE (from 60.8mm to 7.5mm) and boosts PD severity macro-F1
by 17 percentage points, underscoring the value of clinically curated, diverse
training data. CARE-PD and all benchmark code are released for non-commercial

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) offers spatially resolved gene expression but
remains costly. Predicting expression directly from widely available
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images presents a cost-effective
alternative. However, most computational approaches (i) predict each gene
independently, overlooking co-expression structure, and (ii) cast the task as
continuous regression despite expression being discrete counts. This mismatch
can yield biologically implausible outputs and complicate downstream analyses.
We introduce GenAR, a multi-scale autoregressive framework that refines
predictions from coarse to fine. GenAR clusters genes into hierarchical groups
to expose cross-gene dependencies, models expression as codebook-free discrete
token generation to directly predict raw counts, and conditions decoding on
fused histological and spatial embeddings. From an information-theoretic
perspective, the discrete formulation avoids log-induced biases and the
coarse-to-fine factorization aligns with a principled conditional
decomposition. Extensive experimental results on four Spatial Transcriptomics
datasets across different tissue types demonstrate that GenAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, offering potential implications for precision
medicine and cost-effective molecular profiling. Code is publicly available at

Abstract: Imitation learning for end-to-end driving trains policies only on expert
demonstrations. Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery
data: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A
promising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories
beyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via
neural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and
costly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that
photorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is
semantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics,
not textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which
replaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated
primitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers
and cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively
to real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment
that bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization
Augmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning.
RAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail
generalization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo
Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive. Our results show that
lightweight rasterization with feature alignment suffices to scale E2E
training, offering a practical alternative to photorealistic rendering. Project

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier
studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future
trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly
emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable
(i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and
increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on
pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for
enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed
Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists
of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction,
which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward
prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated
unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a
dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty
and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the
noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a
new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford
Drone datasets.

  natural language instructions, MorphoSim produces
  dynamic environments where objects can be directed,

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI
community, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on
large-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated
strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video
understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these
noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects
correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark,
VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric
shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively
on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict
independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple
properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation.
Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one
shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape
types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a
fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important
directions for future research.

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) has attracted increasing attention with the rise
of generative methods. Most existing approaches integrate generative priors
into the restoration pro- cess, aiming to jointly address facial detail
generation and identity preservation. However, these methods often suffer from
a trade-off between visual quality and identity fidelity, leading to either
identity distortion or suboptimal degradation removal. In this paper, we
present CodeFormer++, a novel framework that maximizes the utility of
generative priors for high-quality face restoration while preserving identity.
We decompose BFR into three sub-tasks: (i) identity- preserving face
restoration, (ii) high-quality face generation, and (iii) dynamic fusion of
identity features with realistic texture details. Our method makes three key
contributions: (1) a learning-based deformable face registration module that
semantically aligns generated and restored faces; (2) a texture guided
restoration network to dynamically extract and transfer the texture of
generated face to boost the quality of identity-preserving restored face; and
(3) the integration of deep metric learning for BFR with the generation of
informative positive and hard negative samples to better fuse identity-
preserving and generative features. Extensive experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that, the pro- posed CodeFormer++ achieves
superior performance in terms of both visual fidelity and identity consistency.

Abstract: Effectively applying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Video Question
Answering (VideoQA) hinges on selecting a concise yet comprehensive set of
frames, as processing entire videos is computationally infeasible. However,
current frame selection methods face a critical trade-off: approaches relying
on lightweight similarity models, such as CLIP, often fail to capture the
nuances of complex queries, resulting in inaccurate similarity scores that
cannot reflect the authentic query-frame relevance, which further undermines
frame selection. Meanwhile, methods that leverage a VLM for deeper analysis
achieve higher accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs. To address
these limitations, we propose A.I.R., a training-free approach for Adaptive,
Iterative, and Reasoning-based frame selection. We leverage a powerful VLM to
perform deep, semantic analysis on complex queries, and this analysis is
deployed within a cost-effective iterative loop that processes only a small
batch of the most high-potential frames at a time. Extensive experiments on
various VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
frame selection methods, significantly boosts the performance of the foundation
VLM, and achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency over other
VLM-based techniques.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (AR) generation offers a promising path toward unifying
vision and language models, yet its performance remains suboptimal against
diffusion models. Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations
and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from
the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated
tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose
reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization
objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also
trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the
embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to
the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models.
Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet,
it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard
rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves
a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger
state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection segments objects with intrinsic similarity and

components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention
mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates
a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity,
they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for
camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified
design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel
calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from
context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment.
Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak
influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between
boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_\alpha$
on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed.
Our approach excels across scales, from tiny, intricate objects to large,

data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a
hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting
modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a
two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first
stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency
enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate
datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a
self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that
TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating high-quality
images. Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with
the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all
pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result,
during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated
regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately
impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose
asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct
timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising
process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels,
prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions,
thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently,
these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can
significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts. The code

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image

While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they
often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural
modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this
paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and
direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without
modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample
as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated
scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We
formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion,
which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state
toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and
enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module
that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition,
offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.

Abstract: Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation
that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with
customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis,
researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings
emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution,
existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high
computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional
Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to
arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics
of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive
words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon
this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large
language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic
basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature
space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation
better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized
for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and
retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL.

Abstract: Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process
involving changes in magnification and movement between fields. Although recent
pathology foundation models are strong, practical agentic systems that decide
what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable
diagnoses are still lacking. The blocker is data: scalable, clinically aligned
supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not
written in textbooks or online, and therefore absent from large language model
training. We introduce the AI Session Recorder, which works with standard WSI
viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs
into standardized behavioral commands (inspect or peek at discrete
magnifications) and bounding boxes. A lightweight human-in-the-loop review
turns AI-drafted rationales into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired
"where to look" and "why it matters" supervision produced at roughly six times
lower labeling time. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathologist-o3, a
two-stage agent that first proposes regions of interest and then performs
behavior-guided reasoning. On gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection,
it achieved 84.5% precision, 100.0% recall, and 75.4% accuracy, exceeding the
state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our
knowledge, this constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems
in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated
supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a
path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant success in remote
sensing Earth observation data analysis. Numerous feature fusion techniques
address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global
and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract
structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal
images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and
sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency
interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across
the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a
high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse
spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency
filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is
introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses
low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a
high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity.
In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances
feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four
benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that
S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at https://github.com/HaoLiu-XDU/SSFin.

Abstract: Detecting manipulated media has now become a pressing issue with the recent
rise of deepfakes. Most existing approaches fail to generalize across diverse
datasets and generation techniques. We thus propose a novel ensemble framework,
combining the strengths of transformer-based architectures, such as Swin
Transformers and ViTs, and texture-based methods, to achieve better detection
accuracy and robustness. Our method introduces innovative data-splitting,
sequential training, frequency splitting, patch-based attention, and face
segmentation techniques to handle dataset imbalances, enhance high-impact
regions (e.g., eyes and mouth), and improve generalization. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance when tested on the DFWild-Cup dataset, a diverse
subset of eight deepfake datasets. The ensemble benefits from the
complementarity of these approaches, with transformers excelling in global
feature extraction and texturebased methods providing interpretability. This
work demonstrates that hybrid models can effectively address the evolving
challenges of deepfake detection, offering a robust solution for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a crucial step in various visual applications,
including environmental monitoring through remote sensing. In the context of
the ForestEyes project, which combines citizen science and machine learning to
detect deforestation in tropical forests, image segments are used for labeling
by volunteers and subsequent model training. Traditionally, the Simple Linear
Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm is adopted as the segmentation method.
However, recent studies have indicated that other superpixel-based methods
outperform SLIC in remote sensing image segmentation, and might suggest that
they are more suitable for the task of detecting deforested areas. In this
sense, this study investigated the impact of the four best segmentation
methods, together with SLIC, on the training of classifiers for the target
application. Initially, the results showed little variation in performance
among segmentation methods, even when selecting the top five classifiers using
the PyCaret AutoML library. However, by applying a classifier fusion approach
(ensemble of classifiers), noticeable improvements in balanced accuracy were
observed, highlighting the importance of both the choice of segmentation method
and the combination of machine learning-based models for deforestation
detection tasks.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly integrated into education, virtual
student agents are becoming vital for classroom simulation and teacher
training. Yet their classroom-oriented subjective abilities remain largely
unassessed, limiting understanding of model boundaries and hindering
trustworthy deployment. We present EduPersona, a large-scale benchmark spanning
two languages, three subjects, and ten persona types based on the Big Five
theory. The dataset contains 1,308 authentic classroom dialogue rounds,
corresponding to 12,814 teacher-student Q&A turns, and is further expanded
through persona stylization into roughly 10 times larger scale (128k turns),
providing a solid foundation for evaluation. Building on this resource, we
decompose hard-to-quantify subjective performance into three progressive tasks:
TASK1 basic coherence (whether behavior, emotion, expression, and voice align
with classroom context), TASK2 student realism, and TASK3 long-term persona
consistency, thereby establishing an evaluation framework grounded in
educational theory and research value. We conduct systematic experiments on
three representative LLMs, comparing their original versions with ten
persona-fine-tuned variants trained on EduPersona. Results show consistent and
significant average improvements across all tasks: TASK1 +33.6%, TASK2 +30.6%,
and TASK3 +14.9%. These improvements highlight the dataset's effectiveness and
research value, while also revealing the heterogeneous difficulty of persona
modeling. In summary, EduPersona delivers the first classroom benchmark
centered on subjective abilities, establishes a decoupled and verifiable
research paradigm, and we will open-source both the dataset and the framework
to support the broader research community in advancing trustworthy and
human-like AI for education.

Abstract: Gait encodes rich biometric and behavioural information, yet leveraging the
manner of walking to infer psychological traits remains a challenging and
underexplored problem. We introduce a hierarchical Multi-Stage Mixture of
Movement Experts (MoME) architecture for multi-task prediction of psychological
attributes from gait sequences represented as 2D poses. MoME processes the
walking cycle in four stages of movement complexity, employing lightweight
expert models to extract spatio-temporal features and task-specific gating
modules to adaptively weight experts across traits and stages. Evaluated on the
PsyMo benchmark covering 17 psychological traits, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art gait analysis models, achieving a 37.47% weighted F1 score at
the run level and 44.6% at the subject level. Our experiments show that
integrating auxiliary tasks such as identity recognition, gender prediction,
and BMI estimation further improves psychological trait estimation. Our
findings demonstrate the viability of multi-task gait-based learning for
psychological trait estimation and provide a foundation for future research on
movement-informed psychological inference.

Abstract: In recent years, multi-concept personalization for text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models to represent several subjects in an image has gained much more
attention. The main challenge of this task is "concept mixing", where multiple
learned concepts interfere or blend undesirably in the output image. To address
this issue, in this paper, we present ConceptSplit, a novel framework to split
the individual concepts through training and inference. Our framework comprises
two key components. First, we introduce Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA), a
merging-free training method that focuses exclusively on adapting the value
projection in cross-attention. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that
modifying the key projection, a common approach in existing methods, can
disrupt the attention mechanism and lead to concept mixing. Second, we propose
Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA), which alleviates
attention entanglement during inference by optimizing the input latent. Through
extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that
ConceptSplit achieves robust multi-concept personalization, mitigating
unintended concept interference. Code is available at

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation in multi-phase MRI is vital for liver fibrosis
assessment, yet labeled data is often scarce and unevenly distributed across
imaging modalities and vendor systems. We propose a label-efficient
segmentation approach that promotes cross-modality generalization under
real-world conditions, where GED4 hepatobiliary-phase annotations are limited,
non-contrast sequences (T1WI, T2WI, DWI) are unlabeled, and spatial
misalignment and missing phases are common. Our method integrates a
foundation-scale 3D segmentation backbone adapted via fine-tuning, co-training
with cross pseudo supervision to leverage unlabeled volumes, and a standardized
preprocessing pipeline. Without requiring spatial registration, the model
learns to generalize across MRI phases and vendors, demonstrating robust
segmentation performance in both labeled and unlabeled domains. Our results
exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed label-efficient baseline for liver
segmentation in multi-phase, multi-vendor MRI and highlight the potential of
combining foundation model adaptation with co-training for real-world clinical
imaging tasks.

Abstract: Human-centric generative models designed for AI-driven storytelling must
bring together two core capabilities: identity consistency and precise control
over human performance. While recent diffusion-based approaches have made
significant progress in maintaining facial identity, achieving fine-grained
expression control without compromising identity remains challenging. In this
work, we present a diffusion-based framework that faithfully reimagines any
subject under any particular facial expression. Building on an ID-consistent
face foundation model, we adopt a compositional design featuring an expression
cross-attention module guided by FLAME blendshape parameters for explicit
control. Trained on a diverse mixture of image and video data rich in
expressive variation, our adapter generalizes beyond basic emotions to subtle
micro-expressions and expressive transitions, overlooked by prior works. In
addition, a pluggable Reference Adapter enables expression editing in real
images by transferring the appearance from a reference frame during synthesis.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model
outperforms existing methods in tailored and identity-consistent expression
generation. Code and models can be found at

Abstract: The automatic generation of diverse and human-like facial reactions in dyadic
dialogue remains a critical challenge for human-computer interaction systems.
Existing methods fail to model the stochasticity and dynamics inherent in real
human reactions. To address this, we propose ReactDiff, a novel temporal
diffusion framework for generating diverse facial reactions that are
appropriate for responding to any given dialogue context. Our key insight is
that plausible human reactions demonstrate smoothness, and coherence over time,
and conform to constraints imposed by human facial anatomy. To achieve this,
ReactDiff incorporates two vital priors (spatio-temporal facial kinematics)
into the diffusion process: i) temporal facial behavioral kinematics and ii)
facial action unit dependencies. These two constraints guide the model toward
realistic human reaction manifolds, avoiding visually unrealistic jitters,
unstable transitions, unnatural expressions, and other artifacts. Extensive
experiments on the REACT2024 dataset demonstrate that our approach not only
achieves state-of-the-art reaction quality but also excels in diversity and
reaction appropriateness.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Graph Prediction aims to detect objects and their semantic
relationships in 3D scenes, and has emerged as a crucial technology for
robotics and AR/VR applications. While previous research has addressed dataset
limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings,
they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and
relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks
despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate
through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical
role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we
design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive
pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the
scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification
accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction.
Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we
observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics.
Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the
integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric
and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction.
Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/OCRL-3DSSG-Codes.

Abstract: Camera traps are widely used for wildlife monitoring, but extracting accurate
distance measurements from monocular images remains challenging due to the lack
of depth information. While monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods have
advanced significantly, their performance in natural wildlife environments has
not been systematically evaluated. This work introduces the first benchmark for
monocular metric depth estimation in wildlife monitoring conditions. We
evaluate four state-of-the-art MDE methods (Depth Anything V2, ML Depth Pro,
ZoeDepth, and Metric3D) alongside a geometric baseline on 93 camera trap images
with ground truth distances obtained using calibrated ChARUCO patterns. Our
results demonstrate that Depth Anything V2 achieves the best overall
performance with a mean absolute error of 0.454m and correlation of 0.962,
while methods like ZoeDepth show significant degradation in outdoor natural
environments (MAE: 3.087m). We find that median-based depth extraction
consistently outperforms mean-based approaches across all deep learning
methods. Additionally, we analyze computational efficiency, with ZoeDepth being
fastest (0.17s per image) but least accurate, while Depth Anything V2 provides
an optimal balance of accuracy and speed (0.22s per image). This benchmark
establishes performance baselines for wildlife applications and provides
practical guidance for implementing depth estimation in conservation monitoring
systems.

Abstract: Quantifying sponsor visibility in sports broadcasts is a critical marketing
task traditionally hindered by manual, subjective, and unscalable analysis
methods. While automated systems offer an alternative, their reliance on
axis-aligned Horizontal Bounding Box (HBB) leads to inaccurate exposuremetrics
when logos appear rotated or skewed due to dynamic camera angles and
perspective distortions. This paper introduces ExposureEngine, an end-to-end
system designed for accurate, rotation-aware sponsor visibility analytics in
sports broadcasts, demonstrated in a soccer case study. Our approach predicts
Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) to provide a geometrically precise fit to each logo
regardless of the orientation on-screen. To train and evaluate our detector, we
developed a new dataset comprising 1,103 frames from Swedish elite soccer,
featuring 670 unique sponsor logos annotated with OBBs. Our model achieves a
mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.859, with a precision of 0.96 and recall
of 0.87, demonstrating robust performance in localizing logos under diverse
broadcast conditions. The system integrates these detections into an analytical
pipeline that calculates precise visibility metrics, such as exposure duration
and on-screen coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate a language-driven agentic
layer, enabling users to generate reports, summaries, and media content through
natural language queries. The complete system, including the dataset and the
analytics dashboard, provides a comprehensive solution for auditable and
interpretable sponsor measurement in sports media. An overview of the

Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) is a challenging task in defense
applications, where complex backgrounds and tiny target sizes often result in
numerous false alarms using conventional object detectors. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Anomaly-Aware YOLO (AA-YOLO), which integrates a
statistical anomaly detection test into its detection head. By treating small
targets as unexpected patterns against the background, AA-YOLO effectively
controls the false alarm rate. Our approach not only achieves competitive
performance on several IRSTD benchmarks, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness in scenarios with limited training data, noise, and domain shifts.
Furthermore, since only the detection head is modified, our design is highly
generic and has been successfully applied across various YOLO backbones,
including lightweight models. It also provides promising results when
integrated into an instance segmentation YOLO. This versatility makes AA-YOLO
an attractive solution for real-world deployments where resources are
constrained. The code will be publicly released.

Abstract: The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent
years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While
traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches
have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary
text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in
text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to
capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs
significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present
PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables
open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive
online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D
Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively
enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and
detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of
an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which
adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and
stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene
information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ
achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement
over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Open-vocabulary learning requires modeling the data distribution in open
environments, which consists of both seen-class and unseen-class data.
  Existing methods estimate the distribution in open environments using
seen-class data, where the absence of unseen classes makes the estimation error
inherently unidentifiable.
  Intuitively, learning beyond the seen classes is crucial for distribution
estimation to bound the estimation error.
  We theoretically demonstrate that the distribution can be effectively
estimated by generating unseen-class data, through which the estimation error
is upper-bounded.
  Building on this theoretical insight, we propose a novel open-vocabulary
learning method, which generates unseen-class data for estimating the
distribution in open environments. The method consists of a class-domain-wise
data generation pipeline and a distribution alignment algorithm. The data
generation pipeline generates unseen-class data under the guidance of a
hierarchical semantic tree and domain information inferred from the seen-class
data, facilitating accurate distribution estimation. With the generated data,
the distribution alignment algorithm estimates and maximizes the posterior
probability to enhance generalization in open-vocabulary learning. Extensive
experiments on $11$ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline
approaches by up to $14\%$, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art
in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess
how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt
through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development
without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to
classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the
multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:
generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after
fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear
probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes
(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and
Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and
statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across
centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after
fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission
achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted
limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties
in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal
modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.
Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for
evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight
the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and
underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss
design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of
imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and

Abstract: Vision-transformers (ViTs) and large-scale convolution-neural-networks (CNNs)
have reshaped computer vision through pretrained feature representations that
enable strong transfer learning for diverse tasks. However, their efficiency as
backbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image
deformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers
two such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images
and 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important
problem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D
scene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work
systematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet)
with ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data
size settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are
optimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus
mostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local
and global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of
these models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that,
similar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in
large downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the
inductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing
them to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in
cross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results
emphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for
refinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that
balance local and global representations.

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the demand for Virtual Try-On

overlaid on their own images. Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face
challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world
imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization

image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT
configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel
concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO
image conditioning.
  To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing
varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories,
demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also
redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual
Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories
and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose
preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level
customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation
and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also
outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset
spanning thousands of product categories.

Abstract: Observing surgical practice has historically relied on fixed vantage points
or recollections, leaving the egocentric visual perspectives that guide
clinical decisions undocumented. Fixed-camera video can capture surgical
workflows at the room-scale, but cannot reconstruct what each team member
actually saw. Thus, these videos only provide limited insights into how
decisions that affect surgical safety, training, and workflow optimization are
made. Here we introduce EgoSurg, the first framework to reconstruct the
dynamic, egocentric replays for any operating room (OR) staff directly from
wall-mounted fixed-camera video, and thus, without intervention to clinical
workflow. EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based
view enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and
egocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical
cases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual
fields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity. By
transforming existing OR camera infrastructure into a navigable dynamic 3D
record, EgoSurg establishes a new foundation for immersive surgical data
science, enabling surgical practice to be visualized, experienced, and analyzed
from every angle.

Abstract: Despite interpretability work analyzing VIT encoders and transformer
activations, we don't yet understand why Multimodal Language Models (MLMs)
struggle on perception-heavy tasks. We offer an under-studied perspective by
examining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and
Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the
flow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value
tokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks
zero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and
referring expression detection. We find that while the language model does
augment the visual information received from the projection of input visual
encodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it
contains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual
encoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that
the visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in
later layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception
capability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information
in the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input
improves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal
that if language models were able to better control their visual information,
their perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style
questions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the
language model is not surfaced to the output! Our findings reveal insights into
the role of key-value tokens in multimodal systems, paving the way for deeper
mechanistic interpretability of MLMs and suggesting new directions for training
their visual encoder and language model components.

Abstract: We propose AvatarVTON, the first 4D virtual try-on framework that generates
realistic try-on results from a single in-shop garment image, enabling free
pose control, novel-view rendering, and diverse garment choices. Unlike
existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under
single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or
physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal
Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes
avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer,
which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific
components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a
benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified
modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive
experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic
garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human
applications.

Abstract: Generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI or CBCT plays a crucial role in
enabling MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy, improving treatment
precision while reducing patient radiation exposure. To address this task, we
adopt a fully 3D Flow Matching (FM) framework, motivated by recent work
demonstrating FM's efficiency in producing high-quality images. In our
approach, a Gaussian noise volume is transformed into an sCT image by
integrating a learned FM velocity field, conditioned on features extracted from
the input MRI or CBCT using a lightweight 3D encoder. We evaluated the method
on the SynthRAD2025 Challenge benchmark, training separate models for MRI
$\rightarrow$ sCT and CBCT $\rightarrow$ sCT across three anatomical regions:
abdomen, head and neck, and thorax. Validation and testing were performed
through the challenge submission system. The results indicate that the method
accurately reconstructs global anatomical structures; however, preservation of
fine details was limited, primarily due to the relatively low training
resolution imposed by memory and runtime constraints. Future work will explore
patch-based training and latent-space flow models to improve resolution and
local structural fidelity.

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient deep learning has positioned dataset
distillation as a pivotal technique for compressing training dataset while
preserving model performance. However, existing inner-loop optimization methods
for dataset distillation typically rely on random truncation strategies, which
lack flexibility and often yield suboptimal results. In this work, we observe
that neural networks exhibit distinct learning dynamics across different
training stages-early, middle, and late-making random truncation ineffective.
To address this limitation, we propose Automatic Truncated Backpropagation
Through Time (AT-BPTT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts both
truncation positions and window sizes according to intrinsic gradient behavior.
AT-BPTT introduces three key components: (1) a probabilistic mechanism for
stage-aware timestep selection, (2) an adaptive window sizing strategy based on
gradient variation, and (3) a low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that AT-BPTT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving accuracy by an average of 6.16% over baseline methods.
Moreover, our approach accelerates inner-loop optimization by 3.9x while saving
63% memory cost.

Abstract: An accurate and up-to-date model of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant is
essential for its optimal operation and maintenance. However, such a model may
not be easily available. This work introduces a novel approach for PV power
plant mapping based on aerial overview images. It enables the automation of the
mapping process while removing the reliance on third-party data. The presented
mapping method takes advantage of the structural layout of the power plants to
achieve detailed modeling down to the level of individual PV modules. The
approach relies on visual segmentation of PV modules in overview images and the
inference of structural information in each image, assigning modules to
individual benches, rows, and columns. We identify visual keypoints related to
the layout and use these to merge detections from multiple images while
maintaining their structural integrity. The presented method was experimentally
verified and evaluated on two different power plants. The final fusion of 3D
positions and semantic structures results in a compact georeferenced model
suitable for power plant maintenance.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic relationship between humans and the built
environment is a key challenge in disciplines ranging from environmental
psychology to reinforcement learning (RL). A central obstacle in modeling these
interactions is the inability to capture human psychological states in a way
that is both generalizable and privacy preserving. Traditional methods rely on
theoretical models or questionnaires, which are limited in scope, static, and
labor intensive. We present a kinesics recognition framework that infers the
communicative functions of human activity -- known as kinesics -- directly from
3D skeleton joint data. Combining a spatial-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the framework
leverages transfer learning to bypass the need for manually defined mappings
between physical actions and psychological categories. The approach preserves
user anonymity while uncovering latent structures in bodily movements that
reflect cognitive and emotional states. Our results on the Dyadic User
EngagemenT (DUET) dataset demonstrate that this method enables scalable,
accurate, and human-centered modeling of behavior, offering a new pathway for
enhancing RL-driven simulations of human-environment interaction.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate sensing, computing, and control to
improve infrastructure performance, focusing on economic goals like performance
and safety. However, they often neglect potential human-centered (or
''social'') benefits. Cyber-physical-social infrastructure systems (CPSIS) aim
to address this by aligning CPS with social objectives. This involves defining
social benefits, understanding human interactions with each other and
infrastructure, developing privacy-preserving measurement methods, modeling
these interactions for prediction, linking them to social benefits, and
actuating the physical environment to foster positive social outcomes. This
paper delves into recognizing dyadic human interactions using real-world data,
which is the backbone to measuring social behavior. This lays a foundation to
address the need to enhance understanding of the deeper meanings and mutual
responses inherent in human interactions. While RGB cameras are informative for
interaction recognition, privacy concerns arise. Depth sensors offer a
privacy-conscious alternative by analyzing skeletal movements. This study
compares five skeleton-based interaction recognition algorithms on a dataset of
12 dyadic interactions. Unlike single-person datasets, these interactions,
categorized into communication types like emblems and affect displays, offer
insights into the cultural and emotional aspects of human interactions.

Abstract: Although deep neural networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification with
relatively high efficiency, they still exhibit high computational costs, often
rendering them impractical for real-time and edge applications. Therefore, a
multitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs
while maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been
introduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a
desirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed
method effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques:
early exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit
model is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary
contribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student
early-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation
loss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the
teacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving significant
reductions in computational complexity without compromising classification
performance. The validity of this approach is substantiated by experimental
results on image classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN, which
further opens new research perspectives for Knowledge Distillation in other
contexts.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research
studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable
experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples
and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct
processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with
variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward
implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when
evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for
well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal
domain.
  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based
IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability
and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by
previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for
IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same
architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores
for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable
predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside
the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA
provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize
spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that
optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep
learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers,
the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end, IoT-enabled robotic system for the
non-destructive, real-time, and spatially-resolved mapping of grape yield and
quality (Brix, Acidity) in vineyards. The system features a comprehensive
analytical pipeline that integrates two key modules: a high-performance model
for grape bunch detection and weight estimation, and a novel deep learning
framework for quality assessment from hyperspectral (HSI) data. A critical
barrier to in-field HSI is the ``domain shift" caused by variable illumination.
To overcome this, our quality assessment is powered by the Light-Invariant
Spectral Autoencoder (LISA), a domain-adversarial framework that learns
illumination-invariant features from uncalibrated data. We validated the
system's robustness on a purpose-built HSI dataset spanning three distinct
illumination domains: controlled artificial lighting (lab), and variable
natural sunlight captured in the morning and afternoon. Results show the
complete pipeline achieves a recall (0.82) for bunch detection and a $R^2$
(0.76) for weight prediction, while the LISA module improves quality prediction
generalization by over 20% compared to the baselines. By combining these robust
modules, the system successfully generates high-resolution, georeferenced data
of both grape yield and quality, providing actionable, data-driven insights for
precision viticulture.

tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by
bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted

of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable
supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data,
together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and
algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for
AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles,
facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying
open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance
accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a

Abstract: Deep learning has become increasingly important in remote sensing image
classification due to its ability to extract semantic information from complex
data. Classification tasks often include predefined label hierarchies that
represent the semantic relationships among classes. However, these hierarchies
are frequently overlooked, and most approaches focus only on fine-grained
classification schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Semantics-Aware
Hierarchical Consensus (SAHC) method for learning hierarchical features and
relationships by integrating hierarchy-specific classification heads within a
deep network architecture, each specialized in different degrees of class
granularity. The proposed approach employs trainable hierarchy matrices, which
guide the network through the learning of the hierarchical structure in a
self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical consensus
mechanism to ensure consistent probability distributions across different
hierarchical levels. This mechanism acts as a weighted ensemble being able to
effectively leverage the inherent structure of the hierarchical classification
task. The proposed SAHC method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with
different degrees of hierarchical complexity on different tasks, using distinct
backbone architectures to effectively emphasize its adaptability. Experimental
results show both the effectiveness of the proposed approach in guiding network
learning and the robustness of the hierarchical consensus for remote sensing
image classification tasks.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have significantly contributed to

constraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and
regional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here,
we introduce Regional Expert Networks (REN), the first anatomically-informed
MoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN
leverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated
to distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise
modeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating
mechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL)
features (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to
interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently
superior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of
0.8646 +/- 0.0467, a +12.5 percent improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC
0.7685, p = 0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe
models achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79)
and aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous
patient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and

Abstract: The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the
availability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is
notoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a
strategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative
data, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement.
Unsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the
annotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing
UAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches
typically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance
estimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data
but also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the
full data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear
selection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the
Natural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes
how sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature
Learning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to
model performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful
Reconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our
comprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all
established UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL
methods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative
visualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance,
enhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.

Abstract: Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique
(MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast
cancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be
missing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression
artifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view
translation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike
natural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large
non-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which
obscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and
Implicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view
translation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address
cross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware
cross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that
anatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions
across views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise
correlations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents
into a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry. The
reconstructed 3D structure is refined and injected into the denoising UNet to
guide cross-view generation with enhanced anatomical awareness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CA3D-Diff achieves superior performance in
bidirectional tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity
and structural consistency. Furthermore, the synthesized views effectively
improve single-view malignancy classification in screening settings,
demonstrating the practical value of our method in real-world diagnostics.

Abstract: Tokenizers are a key component of state-of-the-art generative image models,
extracting the most important features from the signal while reducing data
dimension and redundancy. Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized
variational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and
adversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled
alternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent.
However, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses,
as well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these
limitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for
improved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components
and GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the
diffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder. This makes SSDD the
first diffusion decoder optimized for single-step reconstruction trained
without adversarial losses, reaching higher reconstruction quality and faster
sampling than KL-VAE. In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from
$0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation
quality of DiTs with $3.8\times$ faster sampling. As such, SSDD can be used as
a drop-in replacement for KL-VAE, and for building higher-quality and faster
generative models.

Abstract: Being trained on large and vast datasets, visual foundation models (VFMs) can
be fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks, achieving remarkable performance
and efficiency in various computer vision applications. The high computation
cost of data collection and training motivates the owners of some VFMs to
distribute them alongside the license to protect their intellectual property
rights. However, a dishonest user of the protected model's copy may illegally
redistribute it, for example, to make a profit. As a consequence, the
development of reliable ownership verification tools is of great importance
today, since such methods can be used to differentiate between a redistributed
copy of the protected model and an independent model. In this paper, we propose
an approach to ownership verification of visual foundation models by
fine-tuning a small set of expressive layers of a VFM along with a small
encoder-decoder network to embed digital watermarks into an internal
representation of a hold-out set of input images. Importantly, the watermarks
embedded remain detectable in the functional copies of the protected model,
obtained, for example, by fine-tuning the VFM for a particular downstream task.
Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed method
yields a low probability of false detection of a non-watermarked model and a
low probability of false misdetection of a watermarked model.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks
in resource-constrained environments, such as video-based driver action and
intention recognition. While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL)
methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance
varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending
pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent
representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty
representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against
eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention
recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and
uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action
labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our
results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution
classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based
OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more
efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition
characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons, leading to various movement
disorder symptoms. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to prevent adverse effects,
yet traditional diagnostic methods are often cumbersome and costly. In this
study, a machine learning-based approach is proposed using hand-drawn spiral
and wave images as potential biomarkers for PD detection. Our methodology
leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and
attention mechanisms to improve model performance and resilience against
overfitting. To enhance the diversity and richness of both spiral and wave
categories, the training dataset undergoes augmentation to increase the number
of images. The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing
pre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble
voting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating
predictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy
rates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are
90%, and for wave images, they are 96.67%. After combining the predictions
through ensemble hard voting, the overall accuracy is 93.3%. These findings
underscore the potential of machine learning in early PD diagnosis, offering a
non-invasive and cost-effective solution to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer
vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships,
long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of
Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders
with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that
transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated
reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.
This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training
methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars:
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL)
from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced
inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the
roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques,
addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal
grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through
systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design
principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open
challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We
further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate
rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM
capabilities. Additional resources and updates are maintained at:

Abstract: Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that
establishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent
regions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized
features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater
robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this
paper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle
wide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme
viewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of
these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180
degree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and
local feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++
and Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on
relevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance segmentation and image-goal
navigation. Project Page: https://segmast3r.github.io/

Abstract: Contrast change is an important factor that affects the quality of images.
During image capturing, unfavorable lighting conditions can cause contrast
change and visual quality loss. While various methods have been proposed to
assess the quality of images under different distortions such as blur and
noise, contrast distortion has been largely overlooked as its visual impact and
properties are different from other conventional types of distortions. In this
paper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for
contrast-distorted images. Using a set of contrast enhancement algorithms, we
aim to generate pseudo-reference images that are visually close to the actual
reference image, such that the NR problem is transformed to a Full-reference
(FR) assessment with higher accuracy. To this end, a large dataset of
contrast-enhanced images is produced to train a classification network that can
select the most suitable contrast enhancement algorithm based on image content
and distortion for pseudo-reference image generation. Finally, the evaluation
is performed in the FR manner to assess the quality difference between the
contrast-enhanced (pseudoreference) and degraded images. Performance evaluation
of the proposed method on three databases containing contrast distortions
(CCID2014, TID2013, and CSIQ), indicates the promising performance of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate classification of waste and industrial surface defects
is essential for ensuring sustainable waste management and maintaining high
standards in quality control. This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular
Classifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image
classification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone
for localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture
global semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is
incorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data,
enriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is
the neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that
dynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by
biological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data
complexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification,
we validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2),
which involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental
results across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms
traditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic
Modular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world
image classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and
industrial domains.

Abstract: While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically
pleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured
visuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand
composition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual
fidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic
investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training,
and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3
million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing
programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on
it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a
lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage
training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion,
and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at
inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for
generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an
accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&A
protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models
reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory.
Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning
yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset,
model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for
structured visuals.

Abstract: Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where
characters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character
interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve
each character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context
interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and
because mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters
appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these
issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and
behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation
(CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style
data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously
uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a
curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show
clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and
robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative
storytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page:

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing
clips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent
chain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state
transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and
multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and
future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain,
a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual
reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically,
VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to
generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used
to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only
at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal
overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex,
multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of
generated videos.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research
communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often
requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10
minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves
distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal
information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple
aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To
address these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101
research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and
speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta
Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos
convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we
propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation
video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout
refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,
subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing
slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate
that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and
informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward
automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and
code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.

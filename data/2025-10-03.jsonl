In particular,\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled\ntext-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy\nand perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending\nthese advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant\nchallenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing\nsubtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply\nimage-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally\ninconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent\nadvances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent\ndiffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal\ncausality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot\nor plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with\npriors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for\nautomatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction\nquality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong\nmeasurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.\nExtensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show\nsignificant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that\napply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both\nreconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency."}

To resolve this ambiguity,\nprior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or\nlearned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors\ntypically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,\nwe propose \\textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel\nclass of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in\nthe image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection\nof the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two\nkey advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the\nnull-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information\northogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing\nprocess. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,\ncompatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to\nconventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on\nconvergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.\nEmpirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors\nconsistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse\nproblems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed\ntomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,\nunrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models."}

High-resolution text-to-image generators are\ncurrently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative\nto their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key\ntechnical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this\nlimitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across\nresolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal\nfrom lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a\ntrain-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that\nrecalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.\nNoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and\nis compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable\nDiffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly\nimproved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and\nFlux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by\n10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent\nartifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation."}

More\nspecifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information\nto be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid,\nand dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make\nthe following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each\nphysical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well\nas a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer\nthe physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the\nvisual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer\nvision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and\ntrainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and\nself-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in\na generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though\nbehind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other\nmodels, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting."}

Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to\nthe objects involved.

Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework\nlearns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric\napproach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks\nof the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the\nmost informative regions of the interaction.

We introduce the first theoretical\nframework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling\ndynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through\nstochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as\ncontrol over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic\nalgorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base\nvelocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight\nfine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal\nwhile preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior\nattention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion\ncorrespondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed\nfor multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and\nStable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject\nalignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs\nefficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited\nprompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal\nControl for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art\nmulti-subject fidelity across models."}

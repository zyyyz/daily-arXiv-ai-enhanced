Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware
decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an
evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance,
proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive
distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief
acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences
are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on
CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable
uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect
outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on
prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize
these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These
results indicate that evidence-conditioned tagging provides a more reliable and
interpretable alternative to fixed prediction entropy thresholds for
operational uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study presents a systematic comparison between hybrid quantum-classical
neural networks and purely classical models across three benchmark datasets
(MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10) to evaluate their performance, efficiency, and
robustness. The hybrid models integrate parameterized quantum circuits with
classical deep learning architectures, while the classical counterparts use
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted
over 50 training epochs for each dataset, with evaluations on validation
accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resource usage, and
adversarial robustness (tested with $\epsilon=0.1$ perturbations).Key findings
demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform classical models in
final accuracy, achieving {99.38\% (MNIST), 41.69\% (CIFAR100), and 74.05\%
(STL10) validation accuracy, compared to classical benchmarks of 98.21\%,
32.25\%, and 63.76\%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid advantage scales with
dataset complexity, showing the most significant gains on CIFAR100 (+9.44\%)
and STL10 (+10.29\%). Hybrid models also train 5--12$\times$ faster (e.g.,
21.23s vs. 108.44s per epoch on MNIST) and use 6--32\% fewer parameters} while
maintaining superior generalization to unseen test data.Adversarial robustness
tests reveal that hybrid models are significantly more resilient on simpler
datasets (e.g., 45.27\% robust accuracy on MNIST vs. 10.80\% for classical) but
show comparable fragility on complex datasets like CIFAR100 ($\sim$1\%
robustness for both). Resource efficiency analyses indicate that hybrid models
consume less memory (4--5GB vs. 5--6GB for classical) and lower CPU utilization
(9.5\% vs. 23.2\% on average).These results suggest that hybrid
quantum-classical architectures offer compelling advantages in accuracy,
training efficiency, and parameter scalability, particularly for complex vision
tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Expressway traffic congestion severely reduces travel efficiency and hinders
regional connectivity. Existing "detection-prediction" systems have critical
flaws: low vehicle perception accuracy under occlusion and loss of
long-sequence dependencies in congestion forecasting. This study proposes an
integrated technical framework to resolve these issues.For traffic flow
perception, two baseline algorithms were optimized. Traditional YOLOv11 was
upgraded to YOLOv11-DIoU by replacing GIoU Loss with DIoU Loss, and DeepSort
was improved by fusing Mahalanobis (motion) and cosine (appearance) distances.
Experiments on Chang-Shen Expressway videos showed YOLOv11-DIoU achieved 95.7\%
mAP (6.5 percentage points higher than baseline) with 5.3\% occlusion miss
rate. DeepSort reached 93.8\% MOTA (11.3 percentage points higher than SORT)
with only 4 ID switches. Using the Greenberg model (for 10-15 vehicles/km
high-density scenarios), speed and density showed a strong negative correlation
(r=-0.97), conforming to traffic flow theory. For congestion warning, a
GRU-Attention model was built to capture congestion precursors. Trained 300
epochs with flow, density, and speed, it achieved 99.7\% test accuracy (7-9
percentage points higher than traditional GRU). In 10-minute advance warnings
for 30-minute congestion, time error was $\leq$ 1 minute. Validation with an
independent video showed 95\% warning accuracy, over 90\% spatial overlap of
congestion points, and stable performance in high-flow ($>$5 vehicles/second)
scenarios.This framework provides quantitative support for expressway
congestion control, with promising intelligent transportation applications.

Abstract: This research is part of a study of a real-time, cloud-based on-street
parking service using crowd-sourced in-vehicle fleet data. The service provides
real-time information about available parking spots by classifying
crowd-sourced detections observed via ultrasonic sensors. The goal of this
research is to optimize the current parking service quality by analyzing the
automation of the existing test process for ground truth tests. Therefore,
methods from the field of machine learning, especially image pattern
recognition, are applied to enrich the database and substitute human
engineering work in major areas of the analysis process. After an introduction
into the related areas of machine learning, this paper explains the methods and
implementations made to achieve a high level of automation, applying
convolutional neural networks. Finally, predefined metrics present the
performance level achieved, showing a time reduction of human resources up to
99.58 %. The overall improvements are discussed, summarized, and followed by an
outlook for future development and potential application of the analysis
automation tool.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable
zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection capabilities, vital for reliable
AI systems. Despite this promising capability, a comprehensive understanding of
(1) why they work so effectively, (2) what advantages do they have over
single-modal methods, and (3) how is their behavioral robustness -- remains
notably incomplete within the research community. This paper presents a
systematic empirical analysis of VLM-based OOD detection using in-distribution
(ID) and OOD prompts. (1) Mechanisms: We systematically characterize and
formalize key operational properties within the VLM embedding space that
facilitate zero-shot OOD detection. (2) Advantages: We empirically quantify the
superiority of these models over established single-modal approaches,
attributing this distinct advantage to the VLM's capacity to leverage rich
semantic novelty. (3) Sensitivity: We uncovers a significant and previously
under-explored asymmetry in their robustness profile: while exhibiting
resilience to common image noise, these VLM-based methods are highly sensitive
to prompt phrasing. Our findings contribute a more structured understanding of
the strengths and critical vulnerabilities inherent in VLM-based OOD detection,
offering crucial, empirically-grounded guidance for developing more robust and
reliable future designs.

Abstract: Utilizing recently developed abstract notions of sectional curvature, we
introduce a method for constructing a curvature-based geometric profile of
discrete metric spaces. The curvature concept that we use here captures the
metric relations between triples of points and other points. More
significantly, based on this curvature profile, we introduce a quantitative
measure to evaluate the effectiveness of data representations, such as those
produced by dimensionality reduction techniques. Furthermore, Our experiments
demonstrate that this curvature-based analysis can be employed to estimate the
intrinsic dimensionality of datasets. We use this to explore the large-scale
geometry of empirical networks and to evaluate the effectiveness of
dimensionality reduction techniques.

Abstract: As a developing country, Fiji is facing rapid urbanisation, which is visible
in the massive development projects that include housing, roads, and civil
works. In this study, we present machine learning and remote sensing frameworks
to compare land use and land cover change from 2013 to 2024 in Nadi, Fiji. The
ultimate goal of this study is to provide technical support in land cover/land
use modelling and change detection. We used Landsat-8 satellite image for the
study region and created our training dataset with labels for supervised
machine learning. We used Google Earth Engine and unsupervised machine learning
via k-means clustering to generate the land cover map. We used convolutional
neural networks to classify the selected regions' land cover types. We present
a visualisation of change detection, highlighting urban area changes over time
to monitor changes in the map.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel three-stage framework for real-time foreign
object intrusion (FOI) detection and tracking in power transmission systems.
The framework integrates: (1) a YOLOv7 segmentation model for fast and robust
object localization, (2) a ConvNeXt-based feature extractor trained with
triplet loss to generate discriminative embeddings, and (3) a feature-assisted
IoU tracker that ensures resilient multi-object tracking under occlusion and
motion. To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for
deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The
system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen
objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive
experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the
framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In
addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's
practicality and scalability for real-world edge applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and
interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i)
depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and
inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on
zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of
instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often
imprecise.
  To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and
fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from
an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an
image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects,
then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation,
it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction
following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content
consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We
show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with
human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs
alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows
future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over
time.
  Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing
benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models
spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1),
flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be
used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of
the next generation of editing models. Project page:

Abstract: We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that
ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera
intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly
regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a
factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of
depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that
effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric
frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets,
along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad
range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated
structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth
estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide
extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that
MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while
offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a
universal 3D reconstruction backbone.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ensuring accurate localization of robots in environments without GPS
capability is a challenging task. Visual Place Recognition (VPR) techniques can
potentially achieve this goal, but existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to
changes in illumination, weather, and other seasonal changes. Existing
cross-modal localization methods leverage the geometric properties of RGB
images and 3D LiDAR maps to reduce the sensitivity issues highlighted above.
Currently, state-of-the-art methods struggle in complex scenes, fine-grained or
high-resolution matching, and situations where changes can occur in viewpoint.
In this work, we introduce a framework we call Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal
Place Recognition (SCM-PR) that combines high-level semantics utilizing RGB
images for robust localization in LiDAR maps. Our proposed method introduces: a
VMamba backbone for feature extraction of RGB images; a Semantic-Aware Feature
Fusion (SAFF) module for using both place descriptors and segmentation masks;
LiDAR descriptors that incorporate both semantics and geometry; and a
cross-modal semantic attention mechanism in NetVLAD to improve matching.
Incorporating the semantic information also was instrumental in designing a
Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching and a Semantic Consistency Loss, both in
a contrastive learning framework. Our experimental work on the KITTI and
KITTI-360 datasets show that SCM-PR achieves state-of-the-art performance
compared to other cross-modal place recognition methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is rapidly gaining popularity for its
photorealistic rendering quality and real-time performance, but it generates
massive amounts of data. Hence compressing 3DGS data is necessary for the cost
effectiveness of 3DGS models. Recently, several anchor-based neural compression
methods have been proposed, achieving good 3DGS compression performance.
However, they all rely on uniform scalar quantization (USQ) due to its
simplicity. A tantalizing question is whether more sophisticated quantizers can
improve the current 3DGS compression methods with very little extra overhead
and minimal change to the system. The answer is yes by replacing USQ with
lattice vector quantization (LVQ). To better capture scene-specific
characteristics, we optimize the lattice basis for each scene, improving LVQ's
adaptability and R-D efficiency. This scene-adaptive LVQ (SALVQ) strikes a
balance between the R-D efficiency of vector quantization and the low
complexity of USQ. SALVQ can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS
compression architectures, enhancing their R-D performance with minimal
modifications and computational overhead. Moreover, by scaling the lattice
basis vectors, SALVQ can dynamically adjust lattice density, enabling a single
model to accommodate multiple bit rate targets. This flexibility eliminates the
need to train separate models for different compression levels, significantly
reducing training time and memory consumption.

Abstract: Understanding group-level social interactions in public spaces is crucial for
urban planning, informing the design of socially vibrant and inclusive
environments. Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting
subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically
complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this
challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires
inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract
interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level
Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf
human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify
pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation
algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and
encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view
images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and
socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and
outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage
of real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Bias discovery is critical for black-box generative models, especiall
text-to-image (TTI) models. Existing works predominantly focus on output-level
demographic distributions, which do not necessarily guarantee concept
representations to be disentangled post-mitigation. We propose BiasMap, a
model-agnostic framework for uncovering latent concept-level representational
biases in stable diffusion models. BiasMap leverages cross-attention
attribution maps to reveal structural entanglements between demographics (e.g.,
gender, race) and semantics (e.g., professions), going deeper into
representational bias during the image generation. Using attribution maps of
these concepts, we quantify the spatial demographics-semantics concept
entanglement via Intersection over Union (IoU), offering a lens into bias that
remains hidden in existing fairness discovery approaches. In addition, we
further utilize BiasMap for bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion
sampling that directly modifies latent noise space and minimizes the expected
SoftIoU during the denoising process. Our findings show that existing fairness
interventions may reduce the output distributional gap but often fail to
disentangle concept-level coupling, whereas our mitigation method can mitigate
concept entanglement in image generation while complementing distributional
bias mitigation.

Abstract: The lack of flexible annotation tools has hindered the deployment of AI
models in some scientific areas. Most existing image annotation software
requires users to upload a precollected dataset, which limits support for
on-demand pipelines and introduces unnecessary steps to acquire images. This
constraint is particularly problematic in laboratory environments, where
real-time data acquisition from instruments such as microscopes is increasingly
common. In this work, we introduce \texttt{LivePixel}, a Python-based graphical
user interface that integrates with imaging systems, such as webcams,
microscopes, and others, to enable real-time image annotation. LivePyxel is
designed to be easy to use through a simple interface that allows users to
precisely delimit areas for annotation using tools commonly found in commercial
graphics editing software. Of particular interest is the availability of
B\'ezier splines and binary masks, and the software's capacity to work with
non-destructive layers that enable high-performance editing. LivePyxel also
integrates a wide compatibility across video devices, and it's optimized for
object detection operations via the use of OpenCV in combination with
high-performance libraries designed to handle matrix and linear algebra
operations via Numpy effectively. LivePyxel facilitates seamless data
collection and labeling, accelerating the development of AI models in
experimental workflows. LivePyxel freely available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models enable high-quality virtual try-on (VTO) with their
established image synthesis abilities. Despite the extensive end-to-end
training of large pre-trained models involved in current VTO methods,
real-world applications often prioritize limited training and inference,
serving, and deployment budgets for VTO. To solve this obstacle, we apply
Doob's h-transform efficient fine-tuning (DEFT) for adapting large pre-trained
unconditional models for downstream image-conditioned VTO abilities. DEFT
freezes the pre-trained model's parameters and trains a small h-transform
network to learn a conditional h-transform. The h-transform network allows
training only 1.42 percent of the frozen parameters, compared to a baseline of
5.52 percent in traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).
  To further improve DEFT's performance and decrease existing models' inference
time, we additionally propose an adaptive consistency loss. Consistency
training distills slow but high-performing diffusion models into a fast one
while retaining performance by enforcing consistencies along the inference
path. Inspired by constrained optimization, instead of distillation, we combine
the consistency loss and the denoising score matching loss in a data-adaptive
manner for fine-tuning existing VTO models at a low cost. Empirical results
show the proposed DEFT-VTON method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTO
tasks, with as few as 15 denoising steps, while maintaining competitive
results.

Abstract: Medical image enhancement and segmentation are critical yet challenging tasks
in modern clinical practice, constrained by artifacts and complex anatomical
variations. Traditional deep learning approaches often rely on complex
architectures with limited interpretability. While Kolmogorov-Arnold networks
offer interpretable solutions, their reliance on flattened feature
representations fundamentally disrupts the intrinsic spatial structure of
imaging data. To address this issue we propose a Functional Kolmogorov-Arnold
Network (FunKAN) -- a novel interpretable neural framework, designed
specifically for image processing, that formally generalizes the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem onto functional spaces and learns
inner functions using Fourier decomposition over the basis Hermite functions.
We explore FunKAN on several medical image processing tasks, including Gibbs
ringing suppression in magnetic resonance images, benchmarking on IXI dataset.
We also propose U-FunKAN as state-of-the-art binary medical segmentation model
with benchmarks on three medical datasets: BUSI (ultrasound images), GlaS
(histological structures) and CVC-ClinicDB (colonoscopy videos), detecting
breast cancer, glands and polyps, respectively. Experiments on those diverse
datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other KAN-based backbones in
both medical image enhancement (PSNR, TV) and segmentation (IoU, F1). Our work
bridges the gap between theoretical function approximation and medical image
analysis, offering a robust, interpretable solution for clinical applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Hateful videos present serious risks to online safety and real-world
well-being, necessitating effective detection methods. Although multimodal
classification approaches integrating information from several modalities
outperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful
content defines a video's category. Specifically, they generally treat all
content uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally,
existing multimodal methods cannot systematically capture structured
information in videos, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal dual-stream graph
neural network model. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given
video into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a
complementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features,
highlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are
combined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to
systematically model structured relationships within and across modalities.
Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is
state-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) scene understanding in colonoscopy presents
significant challenges that necessitate automated methods for accurate depth

with temporal consistency across video sequences, limiting their applicability
for 3D reconstruction. We present ColonCrafter, a diffusion-based depth

colonoscopy videos. Our approach learns robust geometric priors from synthetic
colonoscopy sequences to generate temporally consistent depth maps. We also

adapting real clinical videos to match our synthetic training domain.
ColonCrafter achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the C3VD

Although full trajectory 3D reconstruction remains a challenge, we demonstrate

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made a significant
impact on rendering and reconstruction techniques. Current research
predominantly focuses on improving rendering performance and reconstruction
quality using high-performance desktop GPUs, largely overlooking applications
for embedded platforms like micro air vehicles (MAVs). These devices, with
their limited computational resources and memory, often face a trade-off
between system performance and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we
improve existing methods in terms of GPU memory usage while enhancing rendering
quality. Specifically, to address redundant 3D Gaussian primitives in SLAM, we
propose merging them in voxel space based on geometric similarity. This reduces
GPU memory usage without impacting system runtime performance. Furthermore,
rendering quality is improved by initializing 3D Gaussian primitives via
Patch-Grid (PG) point sampling, enabling more accurate modeling of the entire
scene. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on publicly available datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our improvements.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of
autonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably
face distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where
rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD)
cases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on
computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation,
trajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study
formulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing
formal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms
[1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces
adaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving
environments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals
that prediction errors -- even on in-distribution samples -- exhibit
mode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific
dynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves
substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates.
Comprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show
that our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD
approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical
path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.

Abstract: The Amazon rain forest is a vital ecosystem that plays a crucial role in
regulating the Earth's climate and providing habitat for countless species.
Deforestation in the Amazon is a major concern as it has a significant impact
on global carbon emissions and biodiversity. In this paper, we present a method
for detecting deforestation in the Amazon using image pairs from Earth
observation satellites. Our method leverages deep learning techniques to
compare the images of the same area at different dates and identify changes in
the forest cover. We also propose a visual semantic model that automatically
annotates the detected changes with relevant keywords. The candidate annotation
for images are extracted from scientific documents related to the Amazon
region. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of Amazon image pairs and
demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting deforestation and generating
relevant annotations. Our method provides a useful tool for monitoring and
studying the impact of deforestation in the Amazon. While we focus on
environment applications of our work by using images of deforestation in the
Amazon rain forest to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach,
it is generic enough to be applied to other domains.

This work presents an intelligent multimodal framework for medical image
analysis that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in healthcare
diagnostics. The framework integrates Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for automated
tumor detection and clinical report generation across multiple imaging
modalities including CT, MRI, X-ray, and Ultrasound. The system combines visual
feature extraction with natural language processing to enable contextual image
interpretation, incorporating coordinate verification mechanisms and
probabilistic Gaussian modeling for anomaly distribution. Multi-layered
visualization techniques generate detailed medical illustrations, overlay
comparisons, and statistical representations to enhance clinical confidence,
with location measurement achieving 80 pixels average deviation. Result
processing utilizes precise prompt engineering and textual analysis to extract
structured clinical information while maintaining interpretability.
Experimental evaluations demonstrated high performance in anomaly detection
across multiple modalities. The system features a user-friendly Gradio
interface for clinical workflow integration and demonstrates zero-shot learning
capabilities to reduce dependence on large datasets. This framework represents
a significant advancement in automated diagnostic support and radiological
workflow efficiency, though clinical validation and multi-center evaluation are
necessary prior to widespread adoption.

Abstract: In previous work, we introduced a 2D localization algorithm called CLAP,
Clustering to Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which was used during our
championship win in RoboCup 2024, an international autonomous humanoid soccer
competition. CLAP is particularly recognized for its robustness against
outliers, where clustering is employed to suppress noise and mitigate against
erroneous feature matches. This clustering-based strategy provides an
alternative to traditional outlier rejection schemes such as RANSAC, in which
candidates are validated by reprojection error across all data points. In this
paper, CLAP is extended to a more general framework beyond 2D localization,
specifically to 3D localization and image stitching. We also show how CLAP,
RANSAC, and Hough transforms are related. The generalization of CLAP is widely
applicable to many different fields and can be a useful tool to deal with noise
and uncertainty.

Abstract: Image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis.
Deformations are often closely related to the morphological characteristics of
tissues, making accurate feature extraction crucial. Recent weakly supervised
methods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as
segmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function.
However, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their
practical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of
visual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical
image registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
enhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image
datasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather
than using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline
using SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings,
enabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation
patterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the
embedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images.
Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide
coarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on benchmark datasets for both intra-subject cardiac image registration
and inter-subject abdomen CT image registration, achieving performance
improvements of 2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on the abdomen dataset. The source code
will be publicly available on GitHub following the acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Accurate identification of deforestation from satellite images is essential
in order to understand the geographical situation of an area. This paper
introduces a new distributed approach to identify as well as locate
deforestation across different clients using Federated Learning (FL). Federated
Learning enables distributed network clients to collaboratively train a model
while maintaining data privacy and security of the active users. In our
framework, a client corresponds to an edge satellite center responsible for
local data processing. Moreover, FL provides an advantage over centralized
training method which requires combining data, thereby compromising with data
security of the clients. Our framework leverages the FLOWER framework with RAY
framework to execute the distributed learning workload. Furthermore, efficient
client spawning is ensured by RAY as it can select definite amount of users to
create an emulation environment. Our FL framework uses YOLOS-small (a Vision
Transformer variant), Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone, and Faster R-CNN
with a MobileNetV3 backbone models trained and tested on publicly available
datasets. Our approach provides us a different view for image
segmentation-based tasks on satellite imagery.

Abstract: Estimating metric relative camera pose from a pair of images is of great
importance for 3D reconstruction and localisation. However, conventional
two-view pose estimation methods are not metric, with camera translation known
only up to a scale, and struggle with wide baselines and textureless or
reflective surfaces. This paper introduces GARPS, a training-free framework
that casts this problem as the direct alignment of two independently
reconstructed 3D scenes. GARPS leverages a metric monocular depth estimator and
a Gaussian scene reconstructor to obtain a metric 3D Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) for each image. It then refines an initial pose from a feed-forward
two-view pose estimator by optimising a differentiable GMM alignment objective.
This objective jointly considers geometric structure, view-independent colour,
anisotropic covariance, and semantic feature consistency, and is robust to
occlusions and texture-poor regions without requiring explicit 2D
correspondences. Extensive experiments on the Real\-Estate10K dataset
demonstrate that GARPS outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art
learning-based methods, including MASt3R. These results highlight the potential
of bridging single-view perception with multi-view geometry to achieve robust
and metric relative pose estimation.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are constructed with massive operations with
different types and are highly computationally intensive. Among these
operations, multiplication operation is higher in computational complexity and
usually requires {more} energy consumption with longer inference time than
other operations, which hinders the deployment of convolutional neural networks
on mobile devices. In many resource-limited edge devices, complicated
operations can be calculated via lookup tables to reduce computational cost.
Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce a generic and efficient lookup
operation which can be used as a basic operation for the construction of neural
networks. Instead of calculating the multiplication of weights and activation
values, simple yet efficient lookup operations are adopted to compute their
responses. To enable end-to-end optimization of the lookup operation, we
construct the lookup tables in a differentiable manner and propose several
training strategies to promote their convergence. By replacing computationally
expensive multiplication operations with our lookup operations, we develop
lookup networks for the image classification, image super-resolution, and point
cloud classification tasks. It is demonstrated that our lookup networks can
benefit from the lookup operations to achieve higher efficiency in terms of
energy consumption and inference speed while maintaining competitive
performance to vanilla convolutional networks. Extensive experiments show that
our lookup networks produce state-of-the-art performance on different tasks
(both classification and regression tasks) and different data types (both
images and point clouds).

Abstract: Recently, Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) frameworks that pair the
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
have achieved impressive results. However, adapting MLLM to segmentation is
computationally intensive, primarily due to visual token redundancy. We observe
that traditional patch-wise visual projectors struggle to strike a balance
between reducing the number of visual tokens and preserving semantic clarity,
often retaining overly long token sequences to avoid performance drops.
Inspired by text tokenizers, we propose a novel semantic visual projector that
leverages semantic superpixels generated by SAM to identify "visual words" in
an image. By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens,
our approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene
complexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of
information, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to
strengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a
semantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside
superpixels and global context outside. Experiments show that our method cuts
visual tokens by 93% without compromising performance, notably speeding up MLLM
training and inference, and outperforming existing compressive visual
projectors on RIS.

Abstract: As a cornerstone technique for autonomous driving, Bird's Eye View (BEV)
segmentation has recently achieved remarkable progress with pinhole cameras.
However, it is non-trivial to extend the existing methods to fisheye cameras
with severe geometric distortion, ambiguous multi-view correspondences and
unstable temporal dynamics, all of which significantly degrade BEV performance.
To address these challenges, we propose FishBEV, a novel BEV segmentation
framework specifically tailored for fisheye cameras. This framework introduces
three complementary innovations, including a Distortion-Resilient Multi-scale
Extraction (DRME) backbone that learns robust features under distortion while
preserving scale consistency, an Uncertainty-aware Spatial Cross-Attention
(U-SCA) mechanism that leverages uncertainty estimation for reliable cross-view
alignment, a Distance-aware Temporal Self-Attention (D-TSA) module that
adaptively balances near field details and far field context to ensure temporal
coherence. Extensive experiments on the Synwoodscapes dataset demonstrate that
FishBEV consistently outperforms SOTA baselines, regarding the performance
evaluation of FishBEV on the surround-view fisheye BEV segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Effective and interpretable classification of medical images is a challenge
in computer-aided diagnosis, especially in resource-limited clinical settings.
This study introduces spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for
accurate medical image classification with limited, diverse datasets. The
models include SBTAYLOR-KAN, integrating B-splines with Taylor series;
SBRBF-KAN, combining B-splines with Radial Basis Functions; and SBWAVELET-KAN,
embedding B-splines in Morlet wavelet transforms. These approaches leverage
spline-based function approximation to capture both local and global
nonlinearities. The models were evaluated on brain MRI, chest X-rays,
tuberculosis X-rays, and skin lesion images without preprocessing,
demonstrating the ability to learn directly from raw data. Extensive
experiments, including cross-dataset validation and data reduction analysis,
showed strong generalization and stability. SBTAYLOR-KAN achieved up to 98.93%
accuracy, with a balanced F1-score, maintaining over 86% accuracy using only
30% of the training data across three datasets. Despite class imbalance in the
skin cancer dataset, experiments on both imbalanced and balanced versions
showed SBTAYLOR-KAN outperforming other models, achieving 68.22% accuracy.
Unlike traditional CNNs, which require millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet50
with 24.18M), SBTAYLOR-KAN achieves comparable performance with just 2,872
trainable parameters, making it more suitable for constrained medical
environments. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used
for interpretability, highlighting relevant regions in medical images. This
framework provides a lightweight, interpretable, and generalizable solution for
medical image classification, addressing the challenges of limited datasets and
data-scarce scenarios in clinical AI applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, particularly diffusion-based
approaches, has inadvertently facilitated their potential for misuse. Such
models enable malicious exploiters to replicate artistic styles that capture an
artist's creative labor, personal vision, and years of dedication in an
inexpensive manner. This has led to a rise in the need and exploration of
methods for protecting artworks against style mimicry. Although generic
diffusion models can easily mimic an artistic style, finetuning amplifies this
capability, enabling the model to internalize and reproduce the style with
higher fidelity and control. We hypothesize that certain cross-attention layers
exhibit heightened sensitivity to artistic styles. Sensitivity is measured
through activation strengths of attention layers in response to style and
content representations, and assessing their correlations with features
extracted from external models. Based on our findings, we introduce an
efficient and lightweight protection strategy, StyleProtect, that achieves
effective style defense against fine-tuned diffusion models by updating only
selected cross-attention layers. Our experiments utilize a carefully curated
artwork dataset based on WikiArt, comprising representative works from 30
artists known for their distinctive and influential styles and cartoon
animations from the Anita dataset. The proposed method demonstrates promising
performance in safeguarding unique styles of artworks and anime from malicious

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has been increasingly adopted in robotics and
autonomous driving for its ability to infer scene geometry from a single
camera. In self-supervised monocular depth estimation frameworks, the network
jointly generates and exploits depth and pose estimates during training,
thereby eliminating the need for depth labels. However, these methods remain
challenged by uncertainty in the input data, such as low-texture or dynamic
regions, which can cause reduced depth accuracy. To address this, we introduce
UM-Depth, a framework that combines motion- and uncertainty-aware refinement to
enhance depth accuracy at dynamic object boundaries and in textureless regions.
Specifically, we develop a teacherstudent training strategy that embeds
uncertainty estimation into both the training pipeline and network
architecture, thereby strengthening supervision where photometric signals are
weak. Unlike prior motion-aware approaches that incur inference-time overhead
and rely on additional labels or auxiliary networks for real-time generation,
our method uses optical flow exclusively within the teacher network during
training, which eliminating extra labeling demands and any runtime cost.
Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our uncertainty-aware refinement. Overall, UM-Depth achieves
state-of-the-art results in both self-supervised depth and pose estimation on
the KITTI datasets.

Abstract: Recently, query-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in
Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) by using textual static object
queries to drive cross-modal alignment. However, these static queries are

Former (TQF), which factorizes the referring query into three specialized
components: an appearance query for static attributes, an intra-frame
interaction query for spatial relations, and an inter-frame motion query for
temporal association. Instead of relying solely on textual embeddings, our
queries are dynamically constructed by integrating both linguistic cues and
visual guidance. Furthermore, we introduce two motion-aware aggregation modules
that enhance object token representations: Intra-frame Interaction Aggregation
incorporates position-aware interactions among objects within a single frame,
while Inter-frame Motion Aggregation leverages trajectory-guided alignment
across frames to ensure temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple
RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of TQF and the effectiveness of our
structured query design and motion-aware aggregation modules.

Abstract: Generalized visual grounding tasks, including Generalized Referring
Expression Comprehension (GREC) and Segmentation (GRES), extend the classical
visual grounding paradigm by accommodating multi-target and non-target
scenarios. Specifically, GREC focuses on accurately identifying all referential
objects at the coarse bounding box level, while GRES aims for achieve
fine-grained pixel-level perception. However, existing approaches typically
treat these tasks independently, overlooking the benefits of jointly training
GREC and GRES to ensure consistent multi-granularity predictions and streamline
the overall process. Moreover, current methods often treat GRES as a semantic
segmentation task, neglecting the crucial role of instance-aware capabilities
and the necessity of ensuring consistent predictions between instance-level
boxes and masks. To address these limitations, we propose InstanceVG, a
multi-task generalized visual grounding framework equipped with instance-aware
capabilities, which leverages instance queries to unify the joint and
consistency predictions of instance-level boxes and masks. To the best of our
knowledge, InstanceVG is the first framework to simultaneously tackle both GREC
and GRES while incorporating instance-aware capabilities into generalized
visual grounding. To instantiate the framework, we assign each instance query a
prior reference point, which also serves as an additional basis for target
matching. This design facilitates consistent predictions of points, boxes, and
masks for the same instance. Extensive experiments obtained on ten datasets
across four tasks demonstrate that InstanceVG achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly surpassing the existing methods in various
evaluation metrics. The code and model will be publicly available at

Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) is a cross-modal matching task that
aims to retrieve the most relevant person images based on a given text query.
The key challenge in TIPR lies in achieving effective alignment between textual
and visual modalities within a common latent space. To address this challenge,
prior approaches incorporate attention mechanisms for implicit cross-modal
local alignment. However, they lack the ability to verify whether all local
features are correctly aligned. Moreover, existing methods primarily focus on
hard negative samples during model updates, with the goal of refining
distinctions between positive and negative pairs, often neglecting incorrectly
matched positive pairs. To alleviate these issues, we propose FMFA, a
cross-modal Full-Mode Fine-grained Alignment framework, which enhances global
matching through explicit fine-grained alignment and existing implicit
relational reasoning -- hence the term ``full-mode" -- without requiring
additional supervision. Specifically, we design an Adaptive Similarity
Distribution Matching (A-SDM) module to rectify unmatched positive sample
pairs. A-SDM adaptively pulls the unmatched positive pairs closer in the joint
embedding space, thereby achieving more precise global alignment. Additionally,
we introduce an Explicit Fine-grained Alignment (EFA) module, which makes up
for the lack of verification capability of implicit relational reasoning. EFA
strengthens explicit cross-modal fine-grained interactions by sparsifying the
similarity matrix and employs a hard coding method for local alignment. Our
proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among all global matching methods. Our code is

Abstract: In recent years, text-driven image editing has made significant progress.
However, due to the inherent ambiguity and discreteness of natural language,
color editing still faces challenges such as insufficient precision and
difficulty in achieving continuous control. Although linearly interpolating the
embedding vectors of different textual descriptions can guide the model to
generate a sequence of images with varying colors, this approach lacks precise
control over the range of color changes in the output images. Moreover, the
relationship between the interpolation coefficient and the resulting image
color is unknown and uncontrollable. To address these issues, we introduce a
color mapping module that explicitly models the correspondence between the text
embedding space and image RGB values. This module predicts the corresponding
embedding vector based on a given RGB value, enabling precise color control of
the generated images while maintaining semantic consistency. Users can specify
a target RGB range to generate images with continuous color variations within
the desired range, thereby achieving finer-grained, continuous, and
controllable color editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
performs well in terms of color continuity and controllability.

more effectively, improving safety while maintaining user intent and

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing trend in computer vision towards
exploiting RAW sensor data, which preserves richer information compared to
conventional low-bit RGB images. Early studies mainly focused on enhancing
visual quality, while more recent efforts aim to leverage the abundant
information in RAW data to improve the performance of visual perception tasks
such as object detection and segmentation. However, existing approaches still
face two key limitations: large-scale ISP networks impose heavy computational
overhead, while methods based on tuning traditional ISP pipelines are
restricted by limited representational capacity.To address these issues, we
propose Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP), a compact RAW-to-RGB
framework that produces task-oriented representations for pretrained vision
models. Instead of heavy dense convolutional pipelines, TA-ISP predicts a small
set of lightweight, multi-scale modulation operators that act at global,
regional, and pixel scales to reshape image statistics across different spatial
extents. This factorized control significantly expands the range of spatially

computation, and latency tightly constrained. Evaluated on several RAW-domain
detection and segmentation benchmarks under both daytime and nighttime
conditions, TA-ISP consistently improves downstream accuracy while markedly
reducing parameter count and inference time, making it well suited for
deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by rain streak artifacts in low-light conditions
significantly hampers the performance of nighttime surveillance and autonomous
navigation. Existing image deraining techniques are primarily designed for
daytime conditions and perform poorly under nighttime illumination due to the
spatial heterogeneity of rain distribution and the impact of light-dependent
stripe visibility. In this paper, we propose a novel Nighttime Deraining
Location-enhanced Perceptual Network(NDLPNet) that effectively captures the
spatial positional information and density distribution of rain streaks in
low-light environments. Specifically, we introduce a Position Perception Module
(PPM) to capture and leverage spatial contextual information from input data,
enhancing the model's capability to identify and recalibrate the importance of
different feature channels. The proposed nighttime deraining network can
effectively remove the rain streaks as well as preserve the crucial background
information. Furthermore, We construct a night scene rainy (NSR) dataset
comprising 900 image pairs, all based on real-world nighttime scenes, providing
a new benchmark for nighttime deraining task research. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experimental evaluations on both existing datasets and the NSR
dataset consistently demonstrate our method outperform the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods in nighttime deraining tasks. The source code and dataset is

Abstract: Accurately segmenting articulatory structures in real-time magnetic resonance
imaging (rtMRI) remains challenging, as most existing methods rely almost
entirely on visual cues. Yet synchronized acoustic and phonological signals
provide complementary context that can enrich visual information and improve
precision. In this paper, we introduce VocSegMRI, a multimodal framework that
integrates video, audio, and phonological inputs through cross-attention fusion
for dynamic feature alignment. To further enhance cross-modal representation,
we incorporate a contrastive learning objective that improves segmentation
performance even when the audio modality is unavailable at inference. Evaluated
on a sub-set of USC-75 rtMRI dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with a Dice score of 0.95 and a 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance
(HD_95) of 4.20 mm, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines.
Ablation studies confirm the contributions of cross-attention and contrastive
learning to segmentation precision and robustness. These results highlight the
value of integrative multimodal modeling for accurate vocal tract analysis.

Abstract: As generative technologies advance, visual content has evolved into a complex
mix of natural and AI-generated images, driving the need for more efficient
coding techniques that prioritize perceptual quality. Traditional codecs and
learned methods struggle to maintain subjective quality at high compression
ratios, while existing generative approaches face challenges in visual fidelity
and generalization. To this end, we propose a novel generative coding framework
leveraging diffusion priors to enhance compression performance at low bitrates.
Our approach employs a pre-optimized encoder to generate generalized
compressed-domain representations, integrated with the pretrained model's
internal features via a lightweight adapter and an attentive fusion module.
This framework effectively leverages existing pretrained diffusion models and
enables efficient adaptation to different pretrained models for new
requirements with minimal retraining costs. We also introduce a distribution
renormalization method to further enhance reconstruction fidelity. Extensive
experiments show that our method (1) outperforms existing methods in visual
fidelity across low bitrates, (2) improves compression performance by up to 79%
over H.266/VVC, and (3) offers an efficient solution for AI-generated content
while being adaptable to broader content types.

Abstract: While reasoning technology like Chain of Thought (CoT) has been widely
adopted in Vision Language Action (VLA) models, it demonstrates promising
capabilities in end to end autonomous driving. However, recent efforts to
integrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing
unnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To
address this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode
reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is
pretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question
answering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving
commonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode
dataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the
model to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an
Adaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively
applying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes.
Extensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves
a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points.
Moreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and
always Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also
reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline,
demonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive
reasoning.

Abstract: While the pursuit of higher accuracy in deepfake detection remains a central
goal, there is an increasing demand for precise localization of manipulated
regions. Despite the remarkable progress made in classification-based
detection, accurately localizing forged areas remains a significant challenge.
A common strategy is to incorporate forged region annotations during model
training alongside manipulated images. However, such approaches often neglect
the complementary nature of local detail and global semantic context, resulting
in suboptimal localization performance. Moreover, an often-overlooked aspect is
the fusion strategy between local and global predictions. Naively combining the
outputs from both branches can amplify noise and errors, thereby undermining
the effectiveness of the localization.
  To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that independently
predicts manipulated regions using both local and global perspectives. We
employ morphological operations to fuse the outputs, effectively suppressing
noise while enhancing spatial coherence. Extensive experiments reveal the
effectiveness of each module in improving the accuracy and robustness of
forgery localization.

Abstract: Event cameras capture asynchronous pixel-level brightness changes with
microsecond temporal resolution, offering unique advantages for high-speed
vision tasks. Existing methods often convert event streams into intermediate
representations such as frames, voxel grids, or point clouds, which inevitably
require predefined time windows and thus introduce window latency. Meanwhile,
pointwise detection methods face computational challenges that prevent
real-time efficiency due to their high computational cost. To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Variable-Rate Spatial Event Mamba, a novel
architecture that directly processes raw event streams without intermediate
representations. Our method introduces a lightweight causal spatial
neighborhood encoder to efficiently capture local geometric relations, followed
by Mamba-based state space models for scalable temporal modeling with linear
complexity. During inference, a controller adaptively adjusts the processing
speed according to the event rate, achieving an optimal balance between window
latency and inference latency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have established them as
the state-of-the-art method for video generation. However, their inherently
sequential denoising process results in inevitable latency, limiting real-world
applicability. Existing acceleration methods either compromise visual quality
due to architectural modifications or fail to reuse intermediate features at
proper granularity. Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary
contributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature
variations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during
intermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In
this paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to
accelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses
features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce
a similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences
between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby
minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments on several video diffusion models demonstrate that BWCache achieves
up to 2.24$\times$ speedup with comparable visual quality.

Abstract: Spacecraft Pose Estimation (SPE) is a fundamental capability for autonomous
space operations such as rendezvous, docking, and in-orbit servicing. Hybrid
pipelines that combine object detection, keypoint regression, and
Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solvers have recently achieved strong results on
synthetic datasets, yet their performance deteriorates sharply on real or
lab-generated imagery due to the persistent synthetic-to-real domain gap.
Existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches aim to mitigate this issue
but often underperform when a modest number of labeled target samples are
available. In this work, we propose the first Supervised Domain Adaptation
(SDA) framework tailored for SPE keypoint regression. Building on the Learning
Invariant Representation and Risk (LIRR) paradigm, our method jointly optimizes
domain-invariant representations and task-specific risk using both labeled
synthetic and limited labeled real data, thereby reducing generalization error
under domain shift. Extensive experiments on the SPEED+ benchmark demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms source-only, fine-tuning, and oracle
baselines. Notably, with only 5% labeled target data, our method matches or
surpasses oracle performance trained on larger fractions of labeled data. The
framework is lightweight, backbone-agnostic, and computationally efficient,
offering a practical pathway toward robust and deployable spacecraft pose
estimation in real-world space environments.

two key innovations: a semantic weighting mechanism and an optimized particle

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to
transfer models from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain.
While auxiliary self-supervised tasks-particularly contrastive learning-have
improved feature discriminability, masked modeling approaches remain
underexplored in this setting, largely due to architectural incompatibility and
misaligned optimization objectives. We propose Masked Feature Modeling (MFM), a
novel auxiliary task that performs feature masking and reconstruction directly
in the feature space. Unlike existing masked modeling methods that reconstruct
low-level inputs or perceptual features (e.g., HOG or visual tokens), MFM
aligns its learning target with the main segmentation task, ensuring
compatibility with standard architectures like DeepLab and DAFormer without
modifying the inference pipeline. To facilitate effective reconstruction, we
introduce a lightweight auxiliary module, Rebuilder, which is trained jointly
but discarded during inference, adding zero computational overhead at test
time. Crucially, MFM leverages the segmentation decoder to classify the
reconstructed features, tightly coupling the auxiliary objective with the
pixel-wise prediction task to avoid interference with the primary task.
Extensive experiments across various architectures and UDA benchmarks
demonstrate that MFM consistently enhances segmentation performance, offering a
simple, efficient, and generalizable strategy for unsupervised domain-adaptive
semantic segmentation.

Abstract: The classification of pixel spectra of hyperspectral images, i.e. spectral
classification, is used in many fields ranging from agricultural, over medical
to remote sensing applications and is currently also expanding to areas such as
autonomous driving. Even though for full hyperspectral images the
best-performing methods exploit spatial-spectral information, performing
classification solely on spectral information has its own advantages, e.g.
smaller model size and thus less data required for training. Moreover, spectral
information is complementary to spatial information and improvements on either
part can be used to improve spatial-spectral approaches in the future.
Recently, 1D-Justo-LiuNet was proposed as a particularly efficient model with
very few parameters, which currently defines the state of the art in spectral
classification. However, we show that with limited training data the model
performance deteriorates. Therefore, we investigate MiniROCKET and
HDC-MiniROCKET for spectral classification to mitigate that problem. The model
extracts well-engineered features without trainable parameters in the feature
extraction part and is therefore less vulnerable to limited training data. We
show that even though MiniROCKET has more parameters it outperforms
1D-Justo-LiuNet in limited data scenarios and is mostly on par with it in the
general case

specialized expert networks: A main segmentation expert, a signed distance
field regression expert, and a boundary prediction expert, each dedicated to
capturing distinct morphological features. Subsequently, the Multi-Gating
Pseudo-labeling module dynamically aggregates expert features, enabling a
robust fuse-and-refine pseudo-labeling mechanism. Furthermore, to eliminate
manual tuning while dynamically balancing multiple learning objectives, we
propose an Adaptive Multi-Objective Loss. Extensive experiments on GlaS and
CRAG benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in
low-label settings, highlighting the potential of MoE-based architectures in

Abstract: Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly
impedes their real-world applicability. As the primary component for accurately
interpreting visual information, the choice of visual encoder is pivotal. We
hypothesize that the diverse training paradigms employed by different visual
encoders instill them with distinct inductive biases, which leads to their
diverse hallucination performances. Existing benchmarks typically focus on
coarse-grained hallucination detection and fail to capture the diverse
hallucinations elaborated in our hypothesis. To systematically analyze these
effects, we introduce VHBench-10, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately
10,000 samples for evaluating LVLMs across ten fine-grained hallucination
categories. Our evaluations confirm encoders exhibit unique hallucination
characteristics. Building on these insights and the suboptimality of simple
feature fusion, we propose VisionWeaver, a novel Context-Aware Routing Network.
It employs global visual features to generate routing signals, dynamically
aggregating visual features from multiple specialized experts. Comprehensive
experiments confirm the effectiveness of VisionWeaver in significantly reducing
hallucinations and improving overall model performance.

caching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out
that relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy
and speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future
information via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the
same time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we
present \textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy
including a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature
classification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on
self-speculative information. \textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance
score for each token based on self-speculative information and historical
information, and performs cached feature selection through the importance
score. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature
importance scores. \textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the
differences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature
calculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{SpecDiff}
achieves average 2.80 \times, 2.74 \times , and 3.17\times speedup with
negligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow

\textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing

inference.

Semantic Query module, forming the prior clustered buffer. Local Semantic
Awareness then selects representative samples from the buffer to construct
image and text prototypes, with the latter produced by guiding a Large Language

laminographic projections remains challenging, particularly under highly
sparse-view acquisition conditions. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction
algorithm, namely LamiGauss, that combines Gaussian Splatting radiative
rasterization with a dedicated detector-to-world transformation model
incorporating the laminographic tilt angle. LamiGauss leverages an
initialization strategy that explicitly filters out common laminographic
artifacts from the preliminary reconstruction, preventing redundant Gaussians
from being allocated to false structures and thereby concentrating model
capacity on representing the genuine object. Our approach effectively optimizes
directly from sparse projections, enabling accurate and efficient
reconstruction with limited data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and
real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed
method over existing techniques. LamiGauss uses only 3$\%$ of full views to
achieve superior performance over the iterative method optimized on a full

object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of
distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM
outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results

Abstract: Hand tracking holds great promise for intuitive interaction paradigms, but
frame-based methods often struggle to meet the requirements of accuracy, low

such as Extended Reality (XR) devices. Event cameras provide $\mu$s-level
temporal resolution at mW-level power by asynchronously sensing brightness

egocentric First-Person-View 3D hand tracking from a single event camera. We
construct an event-based FPV dataset that couples synthetic training data with
3D labels and real event data with 2D labels for evaluation to address the
scarcity of egocentric benchmarks. EvHand-FPV also introduces a wrist-based
region of interest (ROI) that localizes the hand region via geometric cues,
combined with an end-to-end mapping strategy that embeds ROI offsets into the
network to reduce computation without explicit reconstruction, and a multi-task
learning strategy with an auxiliary geometric feature head that improves
representations without test-time overhead. On our real FPV test set,
EvHand-FPV improves 2D-AUCp from 0.77 to 0.85 while reducing parameters from

Abstract: Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Segmentation (FS-PCS) aims to predict per-point
labels for an unlabeled point cloud, given only a few labeled examples. To
extract discriminative representations from the limited support set, existing
methods have constructed prototypes using conventional algorithms such as
farthest point sampling. However, we point out that its initial randomness
significantly affects FS-PCS performance and that the prototype generation
process remains underexplored despite its prevalence. This motivates us to
investigate an advanced prototype generation method based on attention
mechanism. Despite its potential, we found that vanilla module suffers from the
distributional gap between learnable prototypical tokens and support features.
To overcome this, we propose White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM),
which resolves the misalignment by sandwiching cross-attention between
whitening and coloring transformations. Specifically, whitening aligns the
support features to prototypical tokens before attention process, and
subsequently coloring restores the original distribution to the attended
tokens. This simple yet effective design enables robust attention, thereby
generating representative prototypes by capturing the semantic relationships
among support features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a
significant margin on multiple FS-PCS benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have manifested strong visual question
answering capability. However, they still struggle with aligning the rationale
and the generated answer, leading to inconsistent reasoning and incorrect
responses. To this end, this paper introduces the Self-Rationale Calibration
(SRC) framework to iteratively calibrate the alignment between rationales and
answers. SRC begins by employing a lightweight "rationale fine-tuning"
approach, which modifies the model's response format to require a rationale
before deriving an answer without explicit prompts. Next, SRC searches for a
diverse set of candidate responses from the fine-tuned LVLMs for each sample,
followed by a proposed pairwise scoring strategy using a tailored scoring
model, R-Scorer, to evaluate both rationale quality and factual consistency of
candidates. Based on a confidence-weighted preference curation process, SRC
decouples the alignment calibration into a preference fine-tuning manner,
leading to significant improvements of LVLMs in perception, reasoning, and
generalization across multiple benchmarks. Our results emphasize the
rationale-oriented alignment in exploring the potential of LVLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have become prominent in visual
synthesis tasks due to their powerful customization capabilities, which also
introduce significant security risks, including deepfakes and copyright
infringement. In response, a class of methods known as protective perturbation
emerged, which mitigates image misuse by injecting imperceptible adversarial
noise. However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby
exposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we
formalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder
existing approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation
named AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the
"purification-customization" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1)
Patch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over
high-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep
Guidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different
timesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible
perturbations that persist under representative purification settings,
achieving effective post-customization distortion. Experiments show that, as a
stress test for purification, AntiPure achieves minimal perceptual discrepancy
and maximal distortion, outperforming other protective perturbation methods
within the purification-customization workflow.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However,
the random Gaussian noise used to start the diffusion process influences the
final output, causing variations in image quality and prompt adherence.
Existing noise-level optimization approaches generally rely on extra dataset
construction, additional networks, or backpropagation-based optimization,
limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose Noise Level Guidance
(NLG), a simple, efficient, and general noise-level optimization approach that
refines initial noise by increasing the likelihood of its alignment with
general guidance - requiring no additional training data, auxiliary networks,
or backpropagation. The proposed NLG approach provides a unified framework
generalizable to both conditional and unconditional diffusion models,
accommodating various forms of diffusion-level guidance. Extensive experiments
on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach enhances output
generation quality and input condition adherence. By seamlessly integrating
with existing guidance methods while maintaining computational efficiency, our
method establishes NLG as a practical and scalable enhancement to diffusion
models. Code can be found at

Abstract: Visual counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially when users
need to count objects of a specific type in complex scenes. While recent
models, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language
models (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform
fine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we
introduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate
fine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in
PairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and
count based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The
dataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category
(closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous
evaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of
state-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted
models, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current
models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained
and visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for
diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.

Abstract: We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment),
a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal
semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight
vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps
student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and
translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local
alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on
dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling
efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring
textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized
detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over
baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact
architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models,
proving its suitability for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Drone detection in visually complex environments remains challenging due to
background clutter, small object scale, and camouflage effects. While generic
object detectors like YOLO exhibit strong performance in low-texture scenes,
their effectiveness degrades in cluttered environments with low
object-background separability. To address these limitations, this work
presents an enhanced iteration of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet -- a detection framework
that integrates generic object detection with camouflage object detection
techniques. Building upon the original architecture, the proposed iteration
introduces systematic advancements in training data composition, feature fusion
strategies, and backbone design. Specifically, the training process leverages
large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic data, complemented by a small set of
real-world samples, to enhance robustness under visually complex conditions.
The contribution of intermediate multi-scale FEDER features is systematically
evaluated, and detection performance is comprehensively benchmarked across
multiple YOLO-based backbone configurations. Empirical results indicate that
integrating intermediate FEDER features, in combination with backbone upgrades,
contributes to notable performance improvements. In the most promising
configuration -- YOLO-FEDER FusionNet with a YOLOv8l backbone and FEDER
features derived from the DWD module -- these enhancements lead to a FNR
reduction of up to 39.1 percentage points and a mAP increase of up to 62.8
percentage points at an IoU threshold of 0.5, compared to the initial baseline.

SAIL-VL, SAIL-VL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 2B and 8B
parameter scales across diverse image and video benchmarks, demonstrating
strong capabilities from fine-grained perception to complex reasoning. Three
core innovations drive its effectiveness. First, a large-scale data curation
pipeline with scoring and filtering strategies enhances both quality and
distribution across captioning, OCR, QA, and video data, improving training
efficiency. Second, a progressive training framework begins with a powerful
pre-trained vision encoder (SAIL-ViT), advances through multimodal
pre-training, and culminates in a thinking-fusion SFT-RL hybrid paradigm that
systematically strengthens model capabilities. Third, architectural advances
extend beyond dense LLMs to efficient sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designs.
With these contributions, SAIL-VL2 demonstrates competitive performance across
106 datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging reasoning
benchmarks such as MMMU and MathVista. Furthermore, on the OpenCompass
leaderboard, SAIL-VL2-2B ranks first among officially released open-source
models under the 4B parameter scale, while serving as an efficient and

Abstract: Almost 30% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing radical prostatectomy

Accurate early prediction of BCR, at the time of RP, would contribute to prompt

we propose prostate cancer BCR prediction via fused multi-modal embeddings
(PROFUSEme), which learns cross-modal interactions of clinical, radiology, and

with Cox Proportional Hazard regressors. Quantitative evaluation of our
proposed approach reveals superior performance, when compared with late fusion

Abstract: We introduce Wan-Animate, a unified framework for character animation and
replacement. Given a character image and a reference video, Wan-Animate can
animate the character by precisely replicating the expressions and movements of
the character in the video to generate high-fidelity character videos.
Alternatively, it can integrate the animated character into the reference video
to replace the original character, replicating the scene's lighting and color
tone to achieve seamless environmental integration. Wan-Animate is built upon
the Wan model. To adapt it for character animation tasks, we employ a modified
input paradigm to differentiate between reference conditions and regions for
generation. This design unifies multiple tasks into a common symbolic
representation. We use spatially-aligned skeleton signals to replicate body
motion and implicit facial features extracted from source images to reenact
expressions, enabling the generation of character videos with high
controllability and expressiveness. Furthermore, to enhance environmental
integration during character replacement, we develop an auxiliary Relighting
LoRA. This module preserves the character's appearance consistency while
applying the appropriate environmental lighting and color tone. Experimental
results demonstrate that Wan-Animate achieves state-of-the-art performance. We
are committed to open-sourcing the model weights and its source code.

Abstract: Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues
inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking
performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore,
advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video
scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the
challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models,
this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking
framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture
that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic
information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to
further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce
the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion
Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic
information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the
efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality
video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing
methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in
conventional scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) seeks to identify anomalies from arbitrary
novel categories, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution.
Traditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which
performs anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and
text embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have
demonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we
are the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two
key challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and
anomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent
bias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to
subtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects,
rather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal
framework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a
multimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual
backbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder
provides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain
gap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their
representations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this
baseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module
(AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions
rather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability.
Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate
that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
verifying its superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) seeks to detect audible,

has emphasized refining global predictions through contrastive or collaborative
learning, but neglected stable segment-level supervision and class-aware
cross-modal alignment. To address this, we propose two strategies: (1) an
exponential moving average (EMA)-guided pseudo supervision framework that
generates reliable segment-level masks via adaptive thresholds or top-k
selection, offering stable temporal guidance beyond video-level labels; and (2)
a class-aware cross-modal agreement (CMA) loss that aligns audio and visual
embeddings at reliable segment-class pairs, ensuring consistency across
modalities while preserving temporal structure. Evaluations on LLP and UnAV-100
datasets shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning through masked autoencoders has attracted great
attention for remote sensing (RS) foundation model (FM) development, enabling
improved representation learning across diverse sensors and downstream tasks.
However, existing RS FMs often either suffer from substantial computational
complexity during both training and inference or exhibit limited
representational capacity. These issues restrict their practical applicability
in RS. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptation for enhancing the
efficiency of RS FMs by integrating the Soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism
into the FM. The integration of Soft MoEs into the FM allows modality-specific
expert specialization alongside shared cross-sensor representation learning. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptation, we apply it on the
Cross-Sensor Masked Autoencoder (CSMAE) model, resulting in the Cross-Sensor
Mixture-of-Experts (CSMoE) model. In addition, we introduce a thematic-climatic
descriptor-driven sampling strategy for the construction of a representative
and diverse training set to train our CSMoE model. Extensive experiments on
scene classification, semantic segmentation, and content-based image retrieval
demonstrate that our adaptation yields a reduction in computational
requirements while maintaining or improving representational performance.
Compared to state-of-the-art RS FMs, CSMoE achieves a superior trade-off
between representational capacity, accuracy, and computational efficiency. On
average, CSMoE achieves more than twice the computational efficiency of
existing RS FMs, while maintaining competitive performance across all
experiments. These results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptation
for creating computationally efficient RS FMs. The code for the model, the
training set creation, and the model weights will be available at

Abstract: Accurate histopathological diagnosis often requires multiple differently
stained tissue sections, a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
environmentally taxing due to the use of multiple chemical stains. Recently,
virtual staining has emerged as a promising alternative that is faster,
tissue-conserving, and environmentally friendly. However, existing virtual
staining methods face significant challenges in clinical applications,
primarily due to their reliance on well-aligned paired data. Obtaining such
data is inherently difficult because chemical staining processes can distort
tissue structures, and a single tissue section cannot undergo multiple staining
procedures without damage or loss of information. As a result, most available
virtual staining datasets are either unpaired or roughly paired, making it
difficult for existing methods to achieve accurate pixel-level supervision. To
address this challenge, we propose a robust virtual staining framework
featuring cascaded registration mechanisms to resolve spatial mismatches
between generated outputs and their corresponding ground truth. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models across five datasets, achieving an average improvement of 3.2% on
internal datasets and 10.1% on external datasets. Moreover, in datasets with
substantial misalignment, our approach achieves a remarkable 23.8% improvement
in peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to baseline models. The exceptional
robustness of the proposed method across diverse datasets simplifies the data
acquisition process for virtual staining and offers new insights for advancing
its development.

Abstract: Imagine living in a world composed solely of primitive shapes, could you

images-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic
information to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from
such images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster
images. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and
investigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different
abstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction
Image Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images
generated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then
train and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks
including classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a
comprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We
also discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective
format for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision
tasks.

enhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to
substantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain
gaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to
address the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection
for BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with
their multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric
spaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware
teacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a
Reliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model.
Specifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth
predictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty
estimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are
essential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the
domain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric
embedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two
domains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential
Moving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts
informed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in
four cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D
object detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\% NDS and 9.5\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night
adaptation.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in semantic
segmentation but are hindered by high computational and memory costs. To
address this, we propose STEP (SuperToken and Early-Pruning), a hybrid
token-reduction framework that combines dynamic patch merging and token pruning
to enhance efficiency without significantly compromising accuracy. At the core
of STEP is dCTS, a lightweight CNN-based policy network that enables flexible
merging into superpatches. Encoder blocks integrate also early-exits to remove
high-confident supertokens, lowering computational load. We evaluate our method
on high-resolution semantic segmentation benchmarks, including images up to
1024 x 1024, and show that when dCTS is applied alone, the token count can be
reduced by a factor of 2.5 compared to the standard 16 x 16 pixel patching
scheme. This yields a 2.6x reduction in computational cost and a 3.4x increase
in throughput when using ViT-Large as the backbone. Applying the full STEP
framework further improves efficiency, reaching up to a 4x reduction in
computational complexity and a 1.7x gain in inference speed, with a maximum
accuracy drop of no more than 2.0%. With the proposed STEP configurations, up
to 40% of tokens can be confidently predicted and halted before reaching the
final encoder layer.

Abstract: High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in
video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and
benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or
keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise
avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to
redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While
this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like
lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and
requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense
Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by
reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are
also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore
propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed
for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual
Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated
Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during
tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)
Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions
within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.
Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales
positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal
information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video
understanding.

Abstract: While recent advancements in vision-language models have improved video
understanding, diagnosing their capacity for deep, narrative comprehension
remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks often test short-clip recognition or
use template-based questions, leaving a critical gap in evaluating fine-grained
reasoning over long-form narrative content. To address these gaps, we introduce
$\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$, a comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie
understanding. Our dataset comprises 3,119 multiple-choice question-answer
pairs derived from 1,805 scenes across 200 diverse movies, spanning five novel
fine-grained contextual reasoning categories. We use GPT-4o to generate
diverse, context-rich questions by integrating visual descriptions, captions,
scene titles, and summaries, which require deep narrative understanding. To
ensure high-quality evaluation, our pipeline incorporates a two-stage filtering
process: Context-Independence filtering ensures questions require video
context, while Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency
against the movie content, mitigating hallucinations. Experiments show that
existing MLLMs struggle on $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$; our analysis reveals
that long-range temporal reasoning is a primary bottleneck, with the top
open-source model achieving only 63.15\% accuracy. This underscores significant
challenges in fine-grained contextual understanding and the need for
advancements in long-form movie comprehension.

Abstract: Exams are a fundamental test of expert-level intelligence and require
integrated understanding, reasoning, and generation. Existing exam-style
benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current
generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual
concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce
GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams,
featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized
under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images
and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic
correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even
state-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve
less than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the
great challenge of our benchmark. By framing image generation as an exam,
GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models' ability to integrate knowledge,
reasoning, and generation, providing insights on the path to general AGI.

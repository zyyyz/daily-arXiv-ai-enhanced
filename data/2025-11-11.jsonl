This challenge is especially evident in medical imaging, where domain shifts can degrade both performance and transparency. In this paper, we introduce Randomized-MLP (RMLP) regularization, a contrastive learning-based method that encourages more semantically aligned representations. We use RMLPs when fine-tuning DINOv2 to both medical and natural image modalities, showing that it improves or maintains downstream performance while producing more interpretable attention maps. We also provide a mathematical analysis of RMLPs, offering insights into its role in enhancing ViT-based models and advancing our understanding of contrastive learning."}

Unlike world-model approaches that rely on computationally intensive future scene generation or vision-language-action (VLA) systems constrained by Markov assumptions, we show that a minimal set of semantically rich tokens is sufficient for effective planning. Experiments on the nuPlan benchmark (720 scenarios, over 11,000 samples) using perception-informed BEV representations yield three key findings: (1) even without future prediction, our sparse representation achieves 0.548 m ADE, comparable to or surpassing prior methods reporting around 0.75 m on nuScenes; (2) conditioning trajectory decoding on predicted future tokens reduces ADE to 0.479 m, a 12.6% improvement over current-state baselines; and (3) explicit reconstruction loss offers no benefit and may degrade performance under reliable perception inputs. Notably, we observe the emergence of temporal fuzziness, where the model adaptively attends to task-relevant semantics rather than aligning rigidly to fixed timestamps, providing a cognitive advantage for planning under uncertainty. Our \"token is all you need\" principle marks a paradigm shift from reconstructing the world to understanding it, laying a foundation for cognitively inspired systems that plan through imagination rather than reaction."}

In this paper, we leverage vision-language models' (VLMs') reasoning capabilities to assess the quality of printed parts and introduce in-context learning (ICL) to provide VLMs with necessary application-specific knowledge and demonstration samples. This method eliminates the requirement for large application-specific datasets for training models. We explored different sampling strategies for ICL to search for the optimal configuration that makes use of limited samples. We evaluated these strategies on two VLMs, Gemini-2.5-flash and Gemma3:27b, with quality assessment tasks in wire-laser direct energy deposition processes. The results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can reach quality classification accuracies similar to those of traditional machine learning models while requiring only a minimal number of samples. In addition, unlike traditional classification models that lack transparency, VLMs can generate human-interpretable rationales to enhance trust. Since there are no metrics to evaluate their interpretability in manufacturing applications, we propose two metrics, knowledge relevance and rationale validity, to evaluate the quality of VLMs' supporting rationales. Our results show that ICL-assisted VLMs can address application-specific tasks with limited data, achieving relatively high accuracy while also providing valid supporting rationales for improved decision transparency."}

Our safe pruning strategy integrates Taylor-based channel importance with gradient conflict penalty to keep important channels while removing redundant and conflicting channels. To mitigate performance degradation after pruning, we further design a task head-agnostic distillation method that transfers intermediate backbone and encoder features from a teacher to a student model as guidance. Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that our compressed model achieves a 32.7% reduction in parameters while segmentation performance shows negligible accuracy loss and only a minor decrease in detection (-1.2% for Recall and -1.8% for mAP50) compared to the teacher. The compressed model still runs at 32.7 FPS in real-time. These results show that combining pruning and knowledge distillation provides an effective compression solution for multi-task panoptic perception."}

Experiments show that FilletRec surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and generalization, while using only 0.2\\%-5.4\\% of the parameters of baseline models, demonstrating high model efficiency.

We introduce the Micro-OD benchmark, a curated collection of 252 images specifically curated for in-context learning, with bounding-box annotations spanning 11 cell types across four sources, including two in-lab expert-annotated sets. We systematically evaluate eight VLMs under few-shot conditions and compare variants with and without implicit test-time reasoning tokens. We further implement a hybrid Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD) pipeline that combines a detection head with a VLM-based few-shot classifier, which enhances the few-shot performance of recent VLMs on our benchmark. Across datasets, we observe that zero-shot performance is weak due to the domain gap; however, few-shot support consistently improves detection, with marginal gains achieved after six shots. We observe that models with reasoning tokens are more effective for end-to-end localization, whereas simpler variants are more suitable for classifying pre-localized crops. Our results highlight in-context adaptation as a practical path for microscopy, and our benchmark provides a reproducible testbed for advancing open-vocabulary detection in biomedical imaging."}

Street View Imagery (SVI) and Public Participation GIS (PPGIS) represent two prominent approaches for capturing place-based perceptions that can support urban planning decisions, yet their comparability remains underexplored. This study investigates the alignment between SVI-based perceived attractiveness and residents' reported experiences gathered via a city-wide PPGIS survey in Helsinki, Finland. Using participant-rated SVI data and semantic image segmentation, we trained a machine learning model to predict perceived attractiveness based on visual features. We compared these predictions to PPGIS-identified locations marked as attractive or unattractive, calculating agreement using two sets of strict and moderate criteria. Our findings reveal only partial alignment between the two datasets. While agreement (with a moderate threshold) reached 67% for attractive and 77% for unattractive places, agreement (with a strict threshold) dropped to 27% and 29%, respectively. By analysing a range of contextual variables, including noise, traffic, population presence, and land use, we found that non-visual cues significantly contributed to mismatches. The model failed to account for experiential dimensions such as activity levels and environmental stressors that shape perceptions but are not visible in images. These results suggest that while SVI offers a scalable and visual proxy for urban perception, it cannot fully substitute the experiential richness captured through PPGIS. We argue that both methods are valuable but serve different purposes; therefore, a more integrated approach is needed to holistically capture how people perceive urban environments."}

At first, we theoretically establish SDS as a simplified instance of the Schrödinger Bridge framework. We prove that SDS employs the reverse process of an Schrödinger Bridge, which, under specific conditions (e.g., a Gaussian noise as one end), collapses to SDS's score function of the pre-trained diffusion model. Based upon this, we introduce Trajectory-Centric Distillation (TraCe), a novel text-to-3D generation framework, which reformulates the mathematically trackable framework of Schrödinger Bridge to explicitly construct a diffusion bridge from the current rendering to its text-conditioned, denoised target, and trains a LoRA-adapted model on this trajectory's score dynamics for robust 3D optimization.

Our approach encodes each user as a node in a dynamic preference graph and learns embeddings via a lightweight graph neural network, enabling information sharing across users with overlapping visual tastes. We enhance a diffusion model's editing capabilities by integrating these personalized embeddings into a novel DPO objective, which jointly optimizes for individual alignment and neighborhood coherence.

In this paper, we present a novel registration-free approach for monitoring PCD of complex shapes, eliminating the need for both registration and mesh reconstruction. Our proposal consists of two alternative feature learning methods and a common monitoring scheme. Feature learning methods leverage intrinsic geometric properties of the shape, captured via the Laplacian and geodesic distances.

We introduce VMDT (Video-Modal DecodingTrust), the first unified platform for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) and video-to-text (V2T) models across five key trustworthiness dimensions: safety, hallucination, fairness, privacy, and adversarial robustness. Through our extensive evaluation of 7 T2V models and 19 V2T models using VMDT, we uncover several significant insights. For instance, all open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and often generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness compared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks rise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve -- though overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation with model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety levels.

By comparing screw combinations, the approach demonstrates consistent accuracy in both pairing and registration tasks. The method also employs 2D-3D alignment with screw CAD 3D models to accurately pair and estimate screw pose from dual views. Our results show that the correct screw combination consistently outperforms incorrect pairings across all test cases, even prior to registration.

In this work, we introduce a new reasoning data generation framework spanning diverse skills and levels of complexity with over 1M high-quality synthetic vision-centric questions. The dataset also includes preference data and instruction prompts supporting both offline and online RL. Our synthesis framework proceeds in two stages: (1) scale; and (2) complexity. Reasoning traces are then synthesized through a two-stage process that leverages VLMs and reasoning LLMs, producing CoT traces for VLMs that capture the richness and diverse cognitive behaviors found in frontier reasoning models. Remarkably, we show that finetuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on our data outperforms all open-data baselines across all evaluated vision-centric benchmarks, and even surpasses strong closed-data models such as MiMo-VL-7B-RL on V* Bench, CV-Bench and MMStar-V. Perhaps most surprising, despite being entirely vision-centric, our data transfers positively to text-only reasoning (MMLU-Pro) and audio reasoning (MMAU), demonstrating its effectiveness. Similarly, despite not containing videos or embodied visual data, we observe notable gains when evaluating on a single-evidence embodied QA benchmark (NiEH). Finally, we use our data to analyze the entire VLM post-training pipeline. Our empirical analysis highlights that (i) SFT on high-quality data with non-linear reasoning traces is essential for effective online RL, (ii) staged offline RL matches online RL's performance while reducing compute demands, and (iii) careful SFT on high quality data can substantially improve out-of-domain, cross-modality transfer."}

Although foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) demonstrate strong zero-shot and prompt-guided segmentation capabilities, their performance deteriorates substantially when transferred to medical imaging domains. Current adaptation studies mainly emphasize architectural modifications, while the influence of data characteristics and training regimes has not been systematically examined. In this study, we present a comprehensive, data-centric investigation of SAM2 adaptation for ultrasound video segmentation. We analyze how training-set size, video duration, and augmentation schemes affect adaptation performance under three paradigms: task-specific fine-tuning, intermediate adaptation, and multi-task joint training, across five SAM2 variants and multiple prompting modes. We further design six ultrasound-specific augmentations, assessing their effect relative to generic strategies. Experiments on three representative ultrasound datasets reveal that data scale and temporal context play a more decisive role than model architecture or initialization. Moreover, joint training offers an efficient compromise between modality alignment and task specialization. This work aims to provide empirical insights for developing efficient, data-aware adaptation pipelines for SAM2 in ultrasound video analysis."}

Our approach introduces a vision-language covariance cosine loss to directly align image encoder features with inter-class textual semantic relations, encouraging semantically meaningful and modality-invariant feature representations. Additionally, we incorporate a prototype alignment module that aligns class-wise pixel-level feature distributions across domains using high-level semantic prototypes. This mitigates residual category-level discrepancies and enhances cross-modal consistency.

Transformers mitigate this issue with self-attention mechanisms but lack the ability to preserve local contextual information.

However, two key limitations remain: (1) Shallow layers, which are closer to the input, capture fine-grained details but suffer from information loss as data propagates through deeper layers.

Despite significant progress, designing an accurate and efficient end-to-end text spotter for arbitrary-shaped text remains largely unsolved. We identify the primary bottleneck as the lack of a reliable and efficient text detection method. To address this, we propose a novel parameterized text shape method based on low-rank approximation for precise detection and a triple assignment detection head to enable fast inference. Specifically, unlike other shape representation methods that employ data-irrelevant parameterization, our data-driven approach derives a low-rank subspace directly from labeled text boundaries. To ensure this process is robust against the inherent annotation noise in this data, we utilize a specialized recovery method based on an $\\ell_1$-norm formulation, which accurately reconstructs the text shape with only a few key orthogonal vectors. By exploiting the inherent shape correlation among different text contours, our method achieves consistency and compactness in shape representation. Next, the triple assignment scheme introduces a novel architecture where a deep sparse branch (for stabilized training) is used to guide the learning of an ultra-lightweight sparse branch (for accelerated inference), while a dense branch provides rich parallel supervision. Building upon these advancements, we integrate the enhanced detection module with a lightweight recognition branch to form an end-to-end text spotting framework, termed LRANet++, capable of accurately and efficiently spotting arbitrary-shaped text. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LRANet++ compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Local attention reduces complexity by restricting attention to neighborhoods. Block-sparse kernels can further improve the efficiency of local attention, but conventional local attention patterns often fail to deliver significant speedups because tokens within a window are not contiguous in the 1D sequence. This work proposes a novel method for constructing windows and neighborhoods based on the Hilbert curve. Image tokens are first reordered along a Hilbert curve, and windows and neighborhoods are then formed on the reordered 1D sequence. From a block-sparse perspective, this strategy significantly increases block sparsity and can be combined with existing block-sparse kernels to improve the efficiency of 2D local attention. Experiments show that the proposed Hilbert Window Attention and Hilbert Slide Attention can accelerate window attention and slide attention by about $4\\times$ and $18\\times$, respectively. To assess practicality, the strategy is instantiated as the Hilbert Window Transformer and the Hilbert Neighborhood Transformer, both of which achieve end-to-end speedups with minimal accuracy loss. Overall, combining Hilbert-guided local attention with block-sparse kernels offers a general and practical approach to enhancing the efficiency of 2D local attention for images.

To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI."}

The sensor pixels under each micro-lens receive light from a sub-aperture of the main lens. This enables the image sensor to capture both spatial information and the angular resolution of a scene point. This additional angular information is used to estimate the depth of a 3-D scene. The continuum of virtual viewpoints in light field data enables efficient depth estimation using Epipolar Line Images (EPIs) with robust occlusion handling. However, the trade-off between angular information and spatial information is very critical and depends on the focal position of the camera. To design, develop, implement, and test novel disparity-based light field depth estimation algorithms, the availability of suitable light field image datasets is essential. In this paper, a publicly available light field image dataset is introduced and thoroughly described. We have also demonstrated the effect of focal position on the disparity of a 3-D point as well as the shortcomings of the currently available light field dataset. The proposed dataset contains 285 light field images captured using a Lytro Illum LF camera and 13 synthetic LF images. The proposed dataset also comprises a synthetic dataset with similar disparity characteristics to those of a real light field camera.

To address this limitation, we present a novel Mixture of Ego-Graphs Contrastive Representation Learning (MoEGCL). It mainly consists of two modules.

While deep learning methods have shown promise in SAR despeckling, most methods employ a single unified network to process the entire image, failing to account for the distinct speckle statistics associated with different spatial physical characteristics. It often leads to artifacts, blurred edges, and texture distortion. To address these issues, we propose SAR-FAH, a frequency-adaptive heterogeneous despeckling model based on a divide-and-conquer architecture. First, wavelet decomposition is used to separate the image into frequency sub-bands carrying different intrinsic characteristics. Inspired by their differing noise characteristics, we design specialized sub-networks for different frequency components. The tailored approach leverages statistical variations across frequencies, improving edge and texture preservation while suppressing noise. Specifically, for the low-frequency part, denoising is formulated as a continuous dynamic system via neural ordinary differential equations, ensuring structural fidelity and sufficient smoothness that prevents artifacts. For high-frequency sub-bands rich in edges and textures, we introduce an enhanced U-Net with deformable convolutions for noise suppression and enhanced features. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real SAR images validate the superior performance of the proposed model in noise removal and structural preservation."}

To address this limitation, we introduce Fine-grained Cross-modal Causal Tracing (FCCT) framework, which systematically quantifies the causal effects on visual object perception. FCCT conducts fine-grained analysis covering the full range of visual and textual tokens, three core model components including multi-head self-attention (MHSA), feed-forward networks (FFNs), and hidden states, across all decoder layers. Our analysis is the first to demonstrate that MHSAs of the last token in middle layers play a critical role in aggregating cross-modal information, while FFNs exhibit a three-stage hierarchical progression for the storage and transfer of visual object representations. Building on these insights, we propose Intermediate Representation Injection (IRI), a training-free inference-time technique that reinforces visual object information flow by precisely intervening on cross-modal representations at specific components and layers, thereby enhancing perception and mitigating hallucination. Consistent improvements across five widely used benchmarks and LVLMs demonstrate IRI achieves state-of-the-art performance, while preserving inference speed and other foundational performance."}

Recent generative modeling approaches have attempted to capture progression by mapping images into a latent representational space and then controlling and guiding the representations to generate follow-up images from a baseline image. However, existing approaches impose constraints on distribution learning, leading to latent spaces with limited controllability to generate follow-up images without explicit supervision from subject-specific longitudinal images. In order to enable controlled movements in the latent representational space and generate progression images from a baseline image in an unsupervised manner, we introduce a conditionable Diffusion Auto-encoder framework. The explicit encoding mechanism of image-diffusion auto-encoders forms a compact latent space capturing high-level semantics, providing means to disentangle information relevant for progression. Our approach leverages this latent space to condition and apply controlled shifts to baseline representations for generating follow-up. Controllability is induced by restricting these shifts to a subspace, thereby isolating progression-related factors from subject identity-preserving components. The shifts are implicitly guided by correlating with progression attributes, without requiring subject-specific longitudinal supervision. We validate the generations through image quality metrics, volumetric progression analysis, and downstream classification in Alzheimer's disease datasets from two different sources and disease categories. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach for Alzheimer's progression modeling and longitudinal image generation."}

To alleviate the above issues, we proposed a novel global multiple extraction network (GME-Net) for low-resolution facial expression recognition, which incorporates 1) a hybrid attention-based local feature extraction module with attention similarity knowledge distillation to learn image details from high-resolution network; 2) a multi-scale global feature extraction module with quasi-symmetric structure to mitigate the influence of local image noise and facilitate capturing global image features.

However, current automated methods often rely on resource-heavy Large Language Models (LLMs) or static knowledge graphs and struggle with two fundamental challenges in real-world clinical data: (1) missing modalities, such as incomplete clinical context , and (2) feature entanglement, where mixed modality-specific and shared information leads to suboptimal fusion and clinically unfaithful hallucinated findings. To address these challenges, we propose the DiA-gnostic VLVAE, which achieves robust radiology reporting through Disentangled Alignment. Our framework is designed to be resilient to missing modalities by disentangling shared and modality-specific features using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) based Vision-Language Variational Autoencoder (VLVAE). A constrained optimization objective enforces orthogonality and alignment between these latent representations to prevent suboptimal fusion. A compact LLaMA-X decoder then uses these disentangled representations to generate reports efficiently. On the IU X-Ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, DiA has achieved competetive BLEU@4 scores of 0.266 and 0.134, respectively. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models."}

Even though deep learning models have demonstrated potential, standard convolutional architectures frequently fall short in capturing enough global context, resulting in segmentations that are anatomically inconsistent. To overcome these drawbacks, we suggest a flexible, conditional Denoising Diffusion Model that combines an enhanced UNet-based generative decoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder for global feature extraction. We introduce three primary innovations: 1) an Adaptive Conditioning Bridge (ACB) for efficient, multi-scale fusion of semantic features; 2) a novel Topological Denoising Consistency (TDC) loss component that regularizes training by penalizing structural inconsistencies during denoising; and 3) a dual-head architecture that leverages the denoising objective as a powerful regularizer, enabling a lightweight auxiliary head to perform rapid and accurate inference on smaller datasets and a noise prediction head. Our framework establishes a new state-of-the-art on public breast ultrasound datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.96 on BUSI, 0.90 on BrEaST and 0.97 on BUS-UCLM. Comprehensive ablation studies empirically validate that the model components are critical for achieving these results and for producing segmentations that are not only accurate but also anatomically plausible."}

The proposed framework first performs quasi-canonicalization of point clouds in the SE(3) Lie group space, and then models articulated objects using Point Pair Features (PPF) to predict pose voting parameters by leveraging the invariance properties of SE(3). Finally, semantic information of joint axes is incorporated to impose unified kinematic constraints across all parts of the articulated object. PPF-Tracker is systematically evaluated on both synthetic datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse and challenging environments.

However, generating compositional scenes with multiple subjects and attributes remains a significant challenge. To enhance user control over subject placement, several layout-guided methods have been proposed. However, these methods face numerous challenges, particularly in compositional scenes. Unintended subjects often appear outside the layouts, generated images can be out-of-distribution and contain unnatural artifacts, or attributes bleed across subjects, leading to incorrect visual outputs. In this work, we propose MALeR, a method that addresses each of these challenges. Given a text prompt and corresponding layouts, our method prevents subjects from appearing outside the given layouts while being in-distribution. Additionally, we propose a masked, attribute-aware binding mechanism that prevents attribute leakage, enabling accurate rendering of subjects with multiple attributes, even in complex compositional scenes. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves superior performance in compositional accuracy, generation consistency, and attribute binding compared to previous work. MALeR is particularly adept at generating images of scenes with multiple subjects and multiple attributes per subject."}

By analyzing how a VLM reasons, we can understand how inherent biases are perpetuated and can adversely affect downstream performance. To examine this gap, we systematically analyze social biases in five open-source VLMs for an occupation prediction task, on the FairFace dataset. Across 32 occupations and three different prompting styles, we elicit both predictions and reasoning. Our findings reveal that the biased reasoning patterns systematically underlie intersectional disparities, highlighting the need to align VLM reasoning with human values prior to its downstream deployment."}

We implement and evaluate U-Net and U-Net++ architectures under single-GPU, standard multi-GPU (DataParallel), and optimized multi-GPU training configurations using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) and Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP). Our results show that U-Net++ consistently delivers superior denoising performance, achieving competitive Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structured Similarity Index Method (SSIM) scores, though with less performance in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) compared to U-Net under low and moderate noise levels.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge inheritance approach named OSKT (One-Shot Knowledge Transfer), which consolidates the knowledge of the teacher model into an intermediate carrier called a weight chain. When a downstream scenario demands a model that meets specific resource constraints, this weight chain can be expanded to the target model size without additional computation.

This article introduces MiVID, a lightweight, self-supervised, diffusion-based framework for video interpolation. Our model eliminates the need for explicit motion estimation by combining a 3D U-Net backbone with transformer-style temporal attention, trained under a hybrid masking regime that simulates occlusions and motion uncertainty. The use of cosine-based progressive masking and adaptive loss scheduling allows our network to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without any high-frame-rate supervision. Our framework is evaluated on UCF101-7 and DAVIS-7 datasets. MiVID is trained entirely on CPU using the datasets and 9-frame video segments, making it a low-resource yet highly effective pipeline.

Over the past decade, dominant VPR methods (e.g., NetVLAD) have followed a paradigm that first extracts the patch features/tokens of the input image using a backbone, and then aggregates these patch features into a global descriptor via an aggregator. This backbone-plus-aggregator paradigm has achieved overwhelming dominance in the CNN era and remains widely used in transformer-based models. In this paper, however, we argue that a dedicated aggregator is not necessary in the transformer era, that is, we can obtain robust global descriptors only with the backbone. Specifically, we introduce some learnable aggregation tokens, which are prepended to the patch tokens before a particular transformer block. All these tokens will be jointly processed and interact globally via the intrinsic self-attention mechanism, implicitly aggregating useful information within the patch tokens to the aggregation tokens. Finally, we only take these aggregation tokens from the last output tokens and concatenate them as the global representation. Although implicit aggregation can provide robust global descriptors in an extremely simple manner, where and how to insert additional tokens, as well as the initialization of tokens, remains an open issue worthy of further exploration. To this end, we also propose the optimal token insertion strategy and token initialization method derived from empirical studies. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several VPR datasets with higher efficiency and ranks 1st on the MSLS challenge leaderboard.

It has been observed that the presence of invalid depth areas alters the frequency distribution pattern. In this work, we propose a Spatio-Spectral Mutual Learning framework (S2ML) to harmonize the advantages of both spatial and frequency domains for depth completion. Specifically, we consider the distinct properties of amplitude and phase spectra and devise a dedicated spectral fusion module. Meanwhile, the local and global correlations between spatial-domain and frequency-domain features are calculated in a unified embedding space. The gradual mutual representation and refinement encourage the network to fully explore complementary physical characteristics and priors for more accurate depth completion.

However, the storage requirements of these methods can reach up to $10$MB per frame, making stream FVV in real-time impossible. To address this problem, we propose a novel FVV representation, dubbed StreamSTGS, designed for real-time streaming. StreamSTGS represents a dynamic scene using canonical 3D Gaussians, temporal features, and a deformation field. For high compression efficiency, we encode canonical Gaussian attributes as 2D images and temporal features as a video. This design not only enables real-time streaming, but also inherently supports adaptive bitrate control based on network condition without any extra training. Moreover, we propose a sliding window scheme to aggregate adjacent temporal features to learn local motions, and then introduce a transformer-guided auxiliary training module to learn global motions.

However, processing high-resolution imagery in real time presents significant challenges due to the computational demands of feature extraction, matching, and bundle adjustment (BA). Conventional BA methods either downsample images, sacrificing important details, or require extensive processing time, making them unsuitable for time-critical missions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel real-time BA framework that operates directly on fullresolution UAV imagery without downsampling. Our lightweight, onboard-compatible approach divides each image into user-defined patches (e.g., NxN grids, default 150x150 pixels) and dynamically tracks them across frames using UAV GNSS/IMU data and a coarse, globally available digital surface model (DSM). This ensures spatial consistency for robust feature extraction and matching between patches. Overlapping relationships between images are determined in real time using UAV navigation system, enabling the rapid selection of relevant neighbouring images for localized BA. By limiting optimization to a sliding cluster of overlapping images, including those from adjacent flight strips, the method achieves real-time performance while preserving the accuracy of global BA. The proposed algorithm is designed for seamless integration into the DLR Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS), supporting largearea mapping in real time for disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, and coastal protection.

However, early filming equipment limitations have degraded videos of last-century performances by renowned artists (e.g., low frame rates and resolution), hindering archival efforts. Although space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) has advanced significantly, applying it directly to opera videos remains challenging. The scarcity of datasets impedes the recovery of high frequency details, and existing STVSR methods lack global modeling capabilities, compromising visual quality when handling opera's characteristic large motions. To address these challenges, we pioneer a large scale Chinese Opera Video Clip (COVC) dataset and propose the Mamba-based multiscale fusion network for space-time Opera Video Super-Resolution (MambaOVSR). Specifically, MambaOVSR involves three novel components: the Global Fusion Module (GFM) for motion modeling through a multiscale alternating scanning mechanism, and the Multiscale Synergistic Mamba Module (MSMM) for alignment across different sequence lengths. Additionally, our MambaVR block resolves feature artifacts and positional information loss during alignment. Experimental results on the COVC dataset show that MambaOVSR significantly outperforms the SOTA STVSR method by an average of 1.86 dB in terms of PSNR. Dataset and Code will be publicly released."}

While deep learning-based motion deblurring methods have achieved remarkable progress, existing approaches face fundamental challenges in capturing the long-range spatial dependencies inherent in motion blur patterns. Traditional convolutional methods rely on limited receptive fields and require extremely deep networks to model global spatial relationships. These limitations motivate the need for alternative approaches that incorporate physical priors to guide feature evolution during restoration. In this paper, we propose a progressive training framework that integrates physics-informed PDE dynamics into state-of-the-art restoration architectures. By leveraging advection-diffusion equations to model feature evolution, our approach naturally captures the directional flow characteristics of motion blur while enabling principled global spatial modeling. Our PDE-enhanced deblurring models achieve superior restoration quality with minimal overhead, adding only approximately 1\\% to inference GMACs while providing consistent improvements in perceptual quality across multiple state-of-the-art architectures. Comprehensive experiments on standard motion deblurring benchmarks demonstrate that our physics-informed approach improves PSNR and SSIM significantly across four diverse architectures, including FFTformer, NAFNet, Restormer, and Stripformer. These results validate that incorporating mathematical physics principles through PDE-based global layers can enhance deep learning-based image restoration, establishing a promising direction for physics-informed neural network design in computer vision applications."}

TMM-NN implements this through a lightweight, query-specific trigger patch. The patch is added to the query image, and the network is weakly ``backdoored'' so that any input with the patch is steered toward a dummy class. Images similar to the query need only a slight shift and are classified as the dummy class with high probability, while dissimilar ones are less affected. By ranking candidates by this confidence, TMM-NN retrieves the most semantically related neighbours. Robustness analysis and benchmark experiments confirm this trigger-based ranking outperforms traditional metrics under noise and across diverse tasks."}

The MSGKAN module demonstrates excellent nonlinear feature modeling capability in the spatial domain. By leveraging multi-scale Gaussian basis functions, it effectively captures the feature variations caused by scale changes at different UAV flight altitudes, significantly enhancing the model's adaptability and robustness to scale variations. It is experimentally validated that our proposed FCEKAN and MSGKAN modules are complementary and can effectively capture the frequency and spatial semantic features respectively for better feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the SeaDroneSee, DroneVehicle and DVTOD datasets demonstrate the superior performance and significant advantages of the proposed method in UAV multispectral object perception task.

However, purely data-driven 3DGS often struggles to capture the diverse physics-driven motion patterns in dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, we propose Physics-Informed Deformable Gaussian Splatting (PIDG), which treats each Gaussian particle as a Lagrangian material point with time-varying constitutive parameters and is supervised by 2D optical flow via motion projection. Specifically, we adopt static-dynamic decoupled 4D decomposed hash encoding to reconstruct geometry and motion efficiently. Subsequently, we impose the Cauchy momentum residual as a physics constraint, enabling independent prediction of each particle's velocity and constitutive stress via a time-evolving material field. Finally, we further supervise data fitting by matching Lagrangian particle flow to camera-compensated optical flow, which accelerates convergence and improves generalization. Experiments on a custom physics-driven dataset as well as on standard synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate significant gains in physical consistency and monocular dynamic reconstruction quality."}

Existing generative-model-based approaches, particularly diffusion-model approaches that directly learn the posterior, may suffer from inflexibility -- they require conditioning signals during training, support only a fixed number of input views, and need complete retraining for different measurements. Recent diffusion-based methods have attempted to address this by combining prior models with likelihood updates, but they rely on heuristic fixed step sizes for the likelihood update that lead to slow convergence and suboptimal reconstruction quality. We advance this line of approach by integrating our novel Forward Curvature-Matching (FCM) update method with diffusion sampling. Our method dynamically determines optimal step sizes using only forward automatic differentiation and finite-difference curvature estimates, enabling precise optimization of the likelihood update. This formulation enables high-fidelity reconstruction from both single-view and multi-view inputs, and supports various input modalities through simple operator substitution -- all without retraining. Experiments on ShapeNet and CO3D datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality at matched or lower NFEs, yielding higher F-score and lower CD and EMD, validating its efficiency and adaptability for practical applications.

Treated as \"blind\" solvers, encoder-decoder transformers accurately reconstruct the original layout by reasoning over token sequences alone. Despite being deliberately restricted from accessing visual input, our models achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, often outperforming vision-based methods. These findings highlight the surprising capability of language models to solve problems beyond their native domain, and suggest that unconventional approaches can inspire promising directions for puzzle-solving research."}

Our key insight is that Masked AutoEncoder (MAE), trained to reconstruct masked patches conditioned on visible context, naturally encodes semantic consistency expectations. We formalize this reconstruction process probabilistically, computing conditional Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL, p(masked | visible)) to quantify local semantic anomalies. By aggregating these patch-level statistics with global MAE features through learned fusion, CINEMAE achieves strong cross-generator generalization.

Existing approaches typically adopt fixed primary modality strategies to maximize dominant modality advantages, yet fail to adapt to dynamic variations in modality importance across different samples. Moreover, non-language modalities suffer from sequential redundancy and noise, degrading model performance when they serve as primary inputs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a modality optimization and dynamic primary modality selection framework (MODS). First, a Graph-based Dynamic Sequence Compressor (GDC) is constructed, which employs capsule networks and graph convolution to reduce sequential redundancy in acoustic/visual modalities. Then, we develop a sample-adaptive Primary Modality Selector (MSelector) for dynamic dominance determination.

Point clouds from airborne and ground-based laser scanning are currently the most suitable data source to rapidly derive such information at scale. Recent advancements in deep learning improved segmenting and classifying individual trees and identifying semantic tree components. However, deep learning models typically require large amounts of annotated training data which limits further improvement. Producing dense, high-quality annotations for 3D point clouds, especially in complex forests, is labor-intensive and challenging to scale. We explore strategies to reduce dependence on large annotated datasets using self-supervised and transfer learning architectures. Our objective is to improve performance across three tasks: instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and tree classification using realistic and operational training sets. Our findings indicate that combining self-supervised learning with domain adaptation significantly enhances instance segmentation compared to training from scratch (AP50 +16.98%), self-supervised learning suffices for semantic segmentation (mIoU +1.79%), and hierarchical transfer learning enables accurate classification of unseen species (Jaccard +6.07%). To simplify use and encourage uptake, we integrated the tasks into a unified framework, streamlining the process from raw point clouds to tree delineation, structural analysis, and species classification. Pretrained models reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by ~21%.

V-Shuffle implicitly disrupts the semantic content of the style images by shuffling the value features within the self-attention layers of the diffusion model, thereby preserving low-level style representations. We further introduce a Hybrid Style Regularization that complements these low-level representations with high-level style textures to enhance style fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate that V-Shuffle achieves excellent performance when utilizing multiple style images. Moreover, when applied to a single style image, V-Shuffle outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods."}

To address these issues, we propose Vision-only Dynamic NeRF (VDNeRF), a method that accurately recovers camera trajectories and learns spatiotemporal representations for dynamic urban scenes without requiring additional camera pose information or expensive sensor data. VDNeRF employs two separate NeRF models to jointly reconstruct the scene. The static NeRF model optimizes camera poses and static background, while the dynamic NeRF model incorporates the 3D scene flow to ensure accurate and consistent reconstruction of dynamic objects.

Despite impressive recent developments of multiple-resolution MIL, previous approaches only focus on improving performance, thereby lacking research on well-calibrated MIL that clinical experts can rely on for trustworthy diagnostic results. In this study, we propose Uncertainty-Focused Calibrated MIL (UFC-MIL), which more closely mimics the pathologists' examination behaviors while providing calibrated diagnostic predictions, using multiple images with different resolutions. UFC-MIL includes a novel patch-wise loss that learns the latent patterns of instances and expresses their uncertainty for classification. Also, the attention-based architecture with a neighbor patch aggregation module collects features for the classifier. In addition, aggregated predictions are calibrated through patch-level uncertainty without requiring multiple iterative inferences, which is a key practical advantage. Against challenging public datasets, UFC-MIL shows superior performance in model calibration while achieving classification accuracy comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods."}

We identify this bias, which we call narrative prior, as a key driver of two errors: hallucinations, where non-existent events are introduced or existing ones are misinterpreted, and omissions, where factual events are suppressed because they are misaligned with surrounding context. To systematically evaluate narrative prior-induced errors, we introduce NOAH, a large-scale benchmark that constructs composite videos by inserting clips from other sources into target videos.

We design one captioning task with tailored metrics and three QA tasks - Existence, Temporal, and Narrative - yielding more than 60K evaluation samples. Extensive experiments yield three key findings: (i) most Video LLMs exhibit hallucinations and omissions driven by narrative priors, (ii) the patterns of these errors vary across architectures and depend on event similarity and insertion position, and (iii) reliance on narrative priors intensifies under sampling with fewer frames, amplifying errors when event continuity is weak.

Beyond that, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models, including GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5, and open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL, revealing substantial performance deficits across core tasks of our benchmarks and underscoring that comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge. To enhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate post-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions (SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and reinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL) for VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through zoom-in operations. We observe that when applied to the Qwen2.5-VL model, RL and RARL yield significant gains in low-level entity recognition and high-level storyline ordering, paving the way for more accurate and efficient VLM applications in the comics domain."}

To succeed, models must master three critical capabilities: perceiving nuanced visual details, applying abstract sport rule knowledge, and grounding that knowledge in specific visual evidence. Current sports benchmarks either cover single sports or lack the detailed reasoning chains and precise visual grounding needed to robustly evaluate these core capabilities in a multi-sport context. To address this gap, we introduce SportR, the first multi-sports large-scale benchmark designed to train and evaluate MLLMs on the fundamental reasoning required for sports intelligence. Our benchmark provides a dataset of 5,017 images and 2,101 videos. To enable granular evaluation, we structure our benchmark around a progressive hierarchy of question-answer (QA) pairs designed to probe reasoning at increasing depths - from simple infraction identification to complex penalty prediction. For the most advanced tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, such as determining penalties or explaining tactics, we provide 7,118 high-quality, human-authored Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations. In addition, our benchmark incorporates both image and video modalities and provides manual bounding box annotations to test visual grounding in the image part directly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the profound difficulty of our benchmark. State-of-the-art baseline models perform poorly on our most challenging tasks. While training on our data via Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning improves these scores, they remain relatively low, highlighting a significant gap in current model capabilities. SportR presents a new challenge for the community, providing a critical resource to drive future research in multimodal sports reasoning."}

Previous deep learning-based MMIF methods generally adopt Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction. However, these methods deliver unsatisfactory performances due to the limited receptive field of CNNs and the high computational cost of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has demonstrated a powerful potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, providing a promising solution to MMIF. Unfortunately, Mamba lacks full spatial and frequency perceptions, which are very important for MMIF. Moreover, employing Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task has been proven beneficial for MMIF. However, a primary challenge is how to leverage IR efficiently and effectively. To address the above issues, we propose a novel framework named Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) for MMIF. More specifically, we first propose a three-branch structure to couple MMIF and IR, which can retain complete contents from source images. Then, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both spatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction. Finally, we propose the Dynamic Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB), which can be deployed across different branches for dynamic feature fusion.

The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that emulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then reasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a cardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three synergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung abnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their cardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes structural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic cardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically grounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality prediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines. Beyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning that aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between pulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work establishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from LDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based medical interpretation."}

We present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and identify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward source-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source data, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of high-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of data imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a Low-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency components of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new source tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing source-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We further design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out low-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency features in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization. Additionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy or irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating overfitting risks under limited target supervision.

HiMo-CLIP introduces two key components: a hierarchical decomposition (HiDe) module that extracts latent semantic components from long-form text via in-batch PCA, enabling flexible, batch-aware alignment across different semantic granularities, and a monotonicity-aware contrastive loss (MoLo) that jointly aligns global and component-level representations, encouraging the model to internalize semantic ordering and alignment strength as a function of textual completeness.These components work in concert to produce structured, cognitively-aligned cross-modal representations.

However, our benchmarking reveals significant gaps in their zero-shot Re-ID performance for both known and unknown species. While this highlights the need for collecting labeled data in new domains, exhaustive annotation for Re-ID is laborious and requires domain expertise. Our analyses show that existing unsupervised (USL) and AL Re-ID methods underperform for animal Re-ID. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel AL Re-ID framework that leverages complementary clustering methods to uncover and target structurally ambiguous regions in the embedding space for mining pairs of samples that are both informative and broadly representative. Oracle feedback on these pairs, in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, facilitates a simple annotation interface, which naturally integrates with existing USL methods through our proposed constrained clustering refinement algorithm.

In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed RWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D latent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary strengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer models. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows, utilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and Transformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window.

Despite extensive research on OOD detection in 2D images, direct transfer to 3D LiDAR point clouds has been proven ineffective. Current LiDAR OOD methods struggle to distinguish rare anomalies from common classes, leading to high false-positive rates and overconfident errors in safety-critical settings. We propose Relative Energy Learning (REL), a simple yet effective framework for OOD detection in LiDAR point clouds. REL leverages the energy gap between positive (in-distribution) and negative logits as a relative scoring function, mitigating calibration issues in raw energy values and improving robustness across various scenes. To address the absence of OOD samples during training, we propose a lightweight data synthesis strategy called Point Raise, which perturbs existing point clouds to generate auxiliary anomalies without altering the inlier semantics. Evaluated on SemanticKITTI and the Spotting the Unexpected (STU) benchmark, REL consistently outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Our results highlight that modeling relative energy, combined with simple synthetic outliers, provides a principled and scalable solution for reliable OOD detection in open-world autonomous driving."}

Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to the lack of diverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric consistency in non-standard textures. To address these limitations, AvatarTex introduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline. Our key insight is that while diffusion models excel at generating diversified textures, they lack explicit UV constraints, whereas GANs provide a well-structured latent space that ensures style and topology consistency. By integrating these strengths, AvatarTex achieves high-quality topology-aligned texture synthesis with both artistic and geometric coherence. Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first completes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style and structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances fine details through diffusion-based repainting. To address the need for a stylized texture dataset, we introduce TexHub, a high-resolution collection of 20,000 multi-style UV textures with precise UV-aligned layouts. By leveraging TexHub and our structured diffusion-to-GAN pipeline, AvatarTex establishes a new state-of-the-art in multi-style facial texture reconstruction.

The method aims to simplify color correction by adjusting the Hue (H), Saturation (S), and Value (V) components independently. This approach resolves the inherent color coupling problems in traditional methods.

To address the issues of unstable pose estimation and scene representation distortion caused by geometric texture inconsistency in large outdoor scenes with weak or repetitive textures, we approach the problem from two aspects: pose estimation and scene representation. For pose estimation, we leverage LiDAR-IMU Odometry to provide prior poses for cameras in large-scale environments. These prior pose constraints are incorporated into COLMAP's triangulation process, with pose optimization performed via bundle adjustment. Ensuring consistency between pixel data association and prior poses helps maintain both robustness and accuracy. For scene representation, we introduce normal vector constraints and effective rank regularization to enforce consistency in the direction and shape of Gaussian primitives. These constraints are jointly optimized with the existing photometric loss to enhance the map quality. We evaluate our approach using both public and self-collected datasets. In terms of pose optimization, our method requires only one-third of the time while maintaining accuracy and robustness across both datasets. In terms of scene representation, the results show that our method significantly outperforms conventional 3DGS pipelines.

We present ConeGS, an image-space-informed densification framework that is independent of existing scene geometry state. ConeGS first creates a fast Instant Neural Graphics Primitives (iNGP) reconstruction as a geometric proxy to estimate per-pixel depth. During the subsequent 3DGS optimization, it identifies high-error pixels and inserts new Gaussians along the corresponding viewing cones at the predicted depth values, initializing their size according to the cone diameter. A pre-activation opacity penalty rapidly removes redundant Gaussians, while a primitive budgeting strategy controls the total number of primitives, either by a fixed budget or by adapting to scene complexity, ensuring high reconstruction quality.

However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision, providing only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation. This absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity predictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome these challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student learning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its core is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction (IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP), enabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture.

Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by the IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily integrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing feature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability, particularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations, and variations in camera pose."}

Recent approaches have relied on fully differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and rendering for simultaneous optimization of these properties.

We propose AS-DiffMPM, a differentiable MPM framework that enables physical property estimation with arbitrarily shaped colliders. Our approach extends existing methods by incorporating a differentiable collision handling mechanism, allowing the target object to interact with complex rigid bodies while maintaining end-to-end optimization.

Submitted version", "summary": "While feature-based knowledge distillation has proven highly effective for compressing CNNs, these techniques unexpectedly fail when applied to Vision Transformers (ViTs), often performing worse than simple logit-based distillation. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon through a novel analytical framework termed as ``distillation dynamics\", combining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and activation magnitude tracking. Our investigation reveals that ViTs exhibit a distinctive U-shaped information processing pattern: initial compression followed by expansion. We identify the root cause of negative transfer in feature distillation: a fundamental representational paradigm mismatch between teacher and student models. Through frequency-domain analysis, we show that teacher models employ distributed, high-dimensional encoding strategies in later layers that smaller student models cannot replicate due to limited channel capacity. This mismatch causes late-layer feature alignment to actively harm student performance. Our findings reveal that successful knowledge transfer in ViTs requires moving beyond naive feature mimicry to methods that respect these fundamental representational constraints, providing essential theoretical guidance for designing effective ViTs compression strategies.

While truncated diffusion probabilistic models (TDPMs) hold strong potential with a paradigm optimization, existing TDPMs suffer from entangled accuracy and diversity of predictions with insufficient fidelity and plausibility. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), which introduces a novel inference paradigm and dedicated model components. Firstly, we propose Data-Hierarchical Inference, a redefinition of AMIS-specific inference paradigm, which enhances accuracy and diversity at data-distribution and data-sample level, respectively, for an effective disentanglement. Secondly, Gaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity of predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly modeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\\text{trunc}}$ instead of using sampling-based approximations.Thirdly, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is proposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending semantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM). Comprehensive evaluations on LIDC and ISIC3 datasets demonstrate that ATFM outperforms SOTA methods and simultaneously achieves a more efficient inference. ATFM improves GED and HM-IoU by up to $12\\%$ and $7.3\\%$ compared to advanced methods."}

These issues lead to unstable codeword learning and underutilized codebooks, ultimately degrading the performance of both reconstruction and downstream generation tasks. To this end, we propose VAEVQ, which comprises three key components: (1) Variational Latent Quantization (VLQ), replacing the AE with a VAE for quantization to leverage its structured and smooth latent space, thereby facilitating more effective codeword activation; (2) Representation Coherence Strategy (RCS), adaptively modulating the alignment strength between pre- and post-quantization features to enhance consistency and prevent overfitting to noise; and (3) Distribution Consistency Regularization (DCR), aligning the entire codebook distribution with the continuous latent distribution to improve utilization.

Yet, most models are trained to map short prompts into detailed images, creating a gap between sparse textual input and rich visual outputs. This mismatch reduces controllability, as models often fill in missing details arbitrarily, biasing toward average user preferences and limiting precision for professional use. We address this limitation by training the first open-source text-to-image model on long structured captions, where every training sample is annotated with the same set of fine-grained attributes. This design maximizes expressive coverage and enables disentangled control over visual factors. To process long captions efficiently, we propose DimFusion, a fusion mechanism that integrates intermediate tokens from a lightweight LLM without increasing token length. We also introduce the Text-as-a-Bottleneck Reconstruction (TaBR) evaluation protocol. By assessing how well real images can be reconstructed through a captioning-generation loop, TaBR directly measures controllability and expressiveness, even for very long captions where existing evaluation methods fail. Finally, we demonstrate our contributions by training the large-scale model FIBO, achieving state-of-the-art prompt alignment among open-source models.

The second stage uses a layout-conditioned diffusion model to synthesize a photorealistic image adhering to this layout. We find that task decomposition is critical for LLM-based spatial planning; by simplifying the initial generation to core objects and completing the layout with rule-based insertion, we improve object recall from 57.2% to 99.9% for complex scenes. For image synthesis, we compare two leading conditioning methods: ControlNet and GLIGEN. After domain-specific finetuning on table-setting datasets, we identify a key trade-off: ControlNet preserves text-based stylistic control but suffers from object hallucination, while GLIGEN provides superior layout fidelity at the cost of reduced prompt-based controllability. Our end-to-end system successfully generates images with specified object counts and plausible spatial arrangements, demonstrating the viability of a decoupled approach for compositionally controlled synthesis."}

To address this challenge, we propose the adaptive Morph Patch Transformer (MPT), a novel architecture specifically designed for aortic vascular segmentation. Specifically, MPT introduces an adaptive patch partitioning strategy that dynamically generates morphology-aware patches aligned with complex vascular structures. This strategy can preserve semantic integrity of complex vascular structures within individual patches. Moreover, a Semantic Clustering Attention (SCA) method is proposed to dynamically aggregate features from various patches with similar semantic characteristics. This method enhances the model's capability to segment vessels of varying sizes, preserving the integrity of vascular structures.

In this experiment, we classify colorless microplastic particles (50-300 $μ$m) by illuminating them with linearly polarized laser light and capturing their reflected signals using a polarization-sensitive camera. This reflection-based technique successfully circumvents the transmission-based interference issues that plague many conventional methods when applied in water. Using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for image-based classification, we successfully identified three common polymer types, high-density polyethylene, low-density polyethylene, and polypropylene, achieving a peak mean classification accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. A subsequent feature hierarchy analysis demonstrated that the CNN's decision-making process relies mainly on the microstructural integrity and internal texture (polarization patterns) of the particle rather than its macroshape. Critically, we found that the Angle of Linear Polarization (AOLP) signal is significantly more robust against contextual noise than the Degree of Linear Polarization (DOLP) signal. While the AOLP-based classification achieved superior overall performance, its strength lies in distinguishing between the two polyethylene plastics, showing a lower confusion rate between high-density and low-density polyethylene. Conversely, the DOLP signal demonstrated slightly worse overall classification results but excels at accurately identifying the polypropylene class, which it isolated with greater success than AOLP."}

However, existing methods face two key limitations. Firstly, they often over-rely on high-certainty keywords that explicitly identify the target object while neglecting critical spatial descriptions. Secondly, generalized textual features contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an additional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features. This characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining visual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose Mono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the CLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled Module (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while retaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the model to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions for object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific (2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide corresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates cross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal interactions. Through comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies on the Mono3DRefer dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics.

In this study, we introduce PlantTraitNet, a multi-modal, multi-task uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predictsfour key plant traits (plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content) from citizen science photos using weak supervision. By aggregating individual trait predictions across space, we generate global maps of trait distributions. We validate these maps against independent vegetation survey data (sPlotOpen) and benchmark them against leading global trait products. Our results show that PlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing trait maps across all evaluated traits, demonstrating that citizen science imagery, when integrated with computer vision and geospatial AI, enables not only scalable but also more accurate global trait mapping.

In response, we propose ALIGN, a novel framework that jointly trains a classifier and a masker in an iterative manner. The masker learns to produce soft, task-relevant masks that highlight informative regions, while the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment between its saliency maps and the learned masks. By leveraging high-quality masks as guidance, ALIGN improves both interpretability and generalizability, showing its superiority across various settings. Experiments on the two domain generalization benchmarks, VLCS and Terra Incognita, show that ALIGN consistently outperforms six strong baselines in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings.

Based on the stochastic gradient descent technique, FoCLIP integrates three key components to construct fooling examples: feature alignment as the core module to reduce image-text modality gaps, the score distribution balance module and pixel-guard regularization, which collectively optimize multimodal output equilibrium between CLIPscore performance and image quality. Such a design can be engineered to maximize the CLIPscore predictions across diverse input prompts, despite exhibiting either visual unrecognizability or semantic incongruence with the corresponding adversarial prompts from human perceptual perspectives. Experiments on ten artistic masterpiece prompts and ImageNet subsets demonstrate that optimized images can achieve significant improvement in CLIPscore while preserving high visual fidelity. In addition, we found that grayscale conversion induces significant feature degradation in fooling images, exhibiting noticeable CLIPscore reduction while preserving statistical consistency with original images. Inspired by this phenomenon, we propose a color channel sensitivity-driven tampering detection mechanism that achieves 91% accuracy on standard benchmarks.

However, recent studies reveal that point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to structured adversarial perturbations and geometric corruptions, posing risks to their deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Existing certified defenses limit point-wise perturbations but overlook subtle geometric distortions that preserve individual points yet alter the overall structure, potentially leading to misclassification. In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification framework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting robustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification against global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input point cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured frequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each sub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final prediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are constructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making the partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the object's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the certified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and interpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency domain certification.

Conventional defense mechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack patterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that their unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature space, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we present 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC) mechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC depicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally separable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D recognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance in point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object categories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned classification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of representation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss (FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled feature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive evaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models with various structures on two datasets. For instance, DGCNN's classification accuracy is elevated from 27.2% to 80.9% on ModelNet40 -- a 53.7% absolute gain that surpasses leading baselines by 34.0%."}

However, the open accessibility of VFMs also introduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge of the VFMs to launch potent attacks. This paper investigates a novel and practical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs fine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task, training data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional transfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we demonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the VFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a temporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal representation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA integrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the discrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a temporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential impact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate models or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and efficient attack strategy. Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TVA against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing a previously underexplored security vulnerability in the deployment of video models."}

Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation effectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed strategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient, or does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue existing methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries (e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot fully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum Reinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors to progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex. CRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery operations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the detector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating reinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically selects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently explore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging forgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to generate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate spurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on causally invariant features. This integration ensures robust generalization by decoupling synthetic augmentation patterns from the model's learned representations. Extensive experiments show our method significantly improves detector generalizability, outperforming SOTA methods across multiple cross-domain datasets."}

Despite that recent efforts have shown great potential by exploring generative approaches to address this issue, they often rely on dense voxel representations that are inefficient and struggle to preserve structural detail. To fill this gap, we make the key observation that latent diffusion models (LDMs), though successful in other modalities, have not been effectively leveraged for radar-based 3D generation due to a lack of compatible representations and conditioning strategies. We introduce RaLD, a framework that bridges this gap by integrating scene-level frustum-based LiDAR autoencoding, order-invariant latent representations, and direct radar spectrum conditioning. These insights lead to a more compact and expressive generation process. Experiments show that RaLD produces dense and accurate 3D point clouds from raw radar spectrums, offering a promising solution for robust perception in challenging environments."}

However, a significant limitation of current methods is their reliance on a pre-defined set of in-distribution (ID) ground-truth label names (positives). These fixed label names can be unavailable, unreliable at scale, or become less relevant due to in-distribution shifts after deployment. Towards truly unsupervised OOD detection, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining, bypassing the need for positives. In this paper, we utilize widely available text corpora for positive label mining under a general concept mining paradigm. Within this framework, we propose ClusterMine, a novel positive label mining method. ClusterMine is the first method to achieve state-of-the-art OOD detection performance without access to positive labels. It extracts positive concepts from a large text corpus by combining visual-only sample consistency (via clustering) and zero-shot image-text consistency.

Current popular strategies adopt multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the backbone, supplemented by additional modules to enhance the network ability to handle context information, which is a known limitation of MLPs. In contrast, we introduce a novel perspective for capturing correspondence context information without extra design modules. To this end, we design a two-view correspondence pruning network called LeCoT, which can naturally leverage global context information at different stages. Specifically, the core design of LeCoT is the Spatial-Channel Fusion Transformer block, a newly proposed component that efficiently utilizes both spatial and channel global context information among sparse correspondences. In addition, we integrate the proposed prediction block that utilizes correspondence features from intermediate stages to generate a probability set, which acts as guiding information for subsequent learning phases, allowing the network to more effectively capture robust global context information. Notably, this prediction block progressively refines the probability set, thereby mitigating the issue of information loss that is common in the traditional one. Extensive experiments prove that the proposed LeCoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in correspondence pruning, relative pose estimation, homography estimation, visual localization, and $3$D~reconstruction tasks.

However, current research tends to focus narrowly on single-object prompts with limited contextual diversity. In reality, each object or attribute within a prompt can contribute to bias. For example, the prompt \"an assistant wearing a pink hat\" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink hat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause significant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a preliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where contextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative outcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified based on these associations. Therefore, we introduce a bias adherence score that quantifies how specific object-attribute bindings activate bias. To delve deeper, we develop a training-free context-bias control framework to explore how token decoupling can facilitate the debiasing of semantic bindings. This framework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation tasks. Our analysis of bias scores across various attribute-object bindings and token decorrelation highlights a fundamental challenge: reducing bias without disrupting essential semantic relationships. These findings expose critical limitations in current debiasing approaches when applied to semantically bound contexts, underscoring the need to reassess prevailing bias mitigation strategies."}

However, generative modeling for HSIs presents several challenges. Due to their high spectral dimensionality, HSIs are too memory-intensive for direct input into conventional diffusion models. Furthermore, general generative models lack an understanding of the topological and geometric structures of ground objects in remote sensing imagery. In addition, most diffusion models optimize loss functions at the noise level, leading to a non-intuitive convergence behavior and suboptimal generation quality for complex data. To address these challenges, we propose a Geometric Enhanced Wavelet-based Diffusion Model (GEWDiff), a novel framework for reconstructing hyperspectral images at 4-times super-resolution. A wavelet-based encoder-decoder is introduced that efficiently compresses HSIs into a latent space while preserving spectral-spatial information. To avoid distortion during generation, we incorporate a geometry-enhanced diffusion process that preserves the geometric features. Furthermore, a multi-level loss function was designed to guide the diffusion process, promoting stable convergence and improved reconstruction fidelity. Our model demonstrated state-of-the-art results across multiple dimensions, including fidelity, spectral accuracy, visual realism, and clarity."}

Moreover, different tasks favor distinct feature representations, making it difficult for a single model to perform end-to-end inference across multiple tasks while maintaining accuracy comparable to that of single-task models. To alleviate these issues, we present the HENet and HENet++ framework for multi-task 3D perception and end-to-end autonomous driving.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework for music induced painting assessment that directly models perceptual coherence between music and visual art. We introduce MPD, the first large scale dataset of music painting pairs annotated by domain experts based on perceptual coherence. To better handle ambiguous cases, we further collect pairwise preference annotations.

This paper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this accuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative Clean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to identify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and stealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign task-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an extremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than 1%.

These findings suggest the importance of demand-responsive allocation strategies that can identify areas with under-served populations-such as women and girls-and ensure that limited infrastructure serves the greatest number of people in settings with fixed or shrinking budgets. We also discuss the value of high-resolution remote sensing and machine learning to detect inequality and inform equitable resource planning in complex humanitarian environments."}

As collecting representative examples of all possible anomalies is infeasible, we tackle structural anomaly detection using a self-supervised autoencoder that learns to repair corrupted inputs. To this end, we introduce a corruption model that injects artificial disruptions into training images to mimic structural defects. While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in two key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\\ noise, we apply structured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of segmentation and inpainting. Second, and counterintuitively, we add and preserve Gaussian noise on top of the occlusions, which acts as a Tikhonov regularizer anchoring the Jacobian of the reconstruction function toward identity. This identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and further improves both detection and segmentation accuracy. On the MVTec AD benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art results (I/P-AUROC: 99.9/99.4), supporting our theoretical framework and demonstrating its practical relevance for automatic inspection."}

To address these problems, we propose a novel 4D generation network called 4DSTR, which modulates generative 4D Gaussian Splatting with spatial-temporal rectification. Specifically, temporal correlation across generated 4D sequences is designed to rectify deformable scales and rotations and guarantee temporal consistency.

For KV cache compression, StreamKV introduces a guidance prompt designed to capture the key semantic elements within each segment, ensuring only the most informative KV caches are retained for answering questions. Moreover, StreamKV unifies KV cache retrieval and compression within a single module, performing both in a layer-adaptive manner, thereby further improving the effectiveness of streaming video question answering.

Automatic medical image analysis methods have been proposed to overcome this challenge. However, previous approaches have relied on hand-crafted features that may not capture the irregular and physiologically complex shapes of ischemic stroke lesions. In this study, we present a novel framework for quickly and automatically segmenting ischemic stroke lesions on various MRI sequences, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, DWI, and FLAIR.

Extended version with full Appendix", "summary": "Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) aims to adapt a source-pretrained object detector to a target domain without access to source data. However, existing SFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model, which limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in biased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and discriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on massive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad generalization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD setting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs as external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label quality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted Global Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using patch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2) Prototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level contrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3) Dual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from detection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more reliable supervision.

YoNoSplat predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, which are aggregated into a global representation using either predicted or provided poses. To overcome the inherent difficulty of jointly learning 3D Gaussians and camera parameters, we introduce a novel mixing training strategy. This approach mitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using ground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to a mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training instability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem by a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding camera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic parameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat demonstrates exceptional efficiency, reconstructing a scene from 100 views (at 280x518 resolution) in just 2.69 seconds on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU.

In light of such data constraints, we explore an inference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for enhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by finetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient techniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the diffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that better align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach leads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on the KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared to unguided baseline samples.

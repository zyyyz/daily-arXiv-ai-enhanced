Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the
inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as
low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion
in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF
depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric
calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between
modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract
complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by
monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform
depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth
consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy,
improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy,
structural consistency, and visual quality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image
synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise
number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings.
We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models
with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The
approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation,
where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial
arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine
layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between
objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention
masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I
CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves
counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual
quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score
of 0.97.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with
compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to
handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores
the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of
CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition"
directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently
affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this
study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of
compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural
language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches
often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)
makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,
including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory
overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we
propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules
into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a
robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,
a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node
pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial
reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;
and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust
actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space
(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),
which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving
higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art
performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success
weighted by Path Length (SPL).

Abstract: Classifying soil images contributes to better land management, increased
agricultural output, and practical solutions for environmental issues. The
development of various disciplines, particularly agriculture, civil
engineering, and natural resource management, is aided by understanding of soil
quality since it helps with risk reduction, performance improvement, and sound
decision-making . Artificial intelligence has recently been used in a number of
different fields. In this study, an intelligent model was constructed using
Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network
using the Whale optimization algorithm and the Particle swarm optimization
algorithm, and comparing the results of using the two algorithms in the process
of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were
adopted to test the system, and the results of the proposed work were efficient

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often
relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human
operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been
introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs
without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in
real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that
leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge
distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable
quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire
direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity
and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results
highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable
quality assessment in AM applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in
disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to
the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be
run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire
monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage
1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips
using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In
addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame
information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction
accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the
improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1
method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the
Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage
1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage
2 compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),
outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%
HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%).
CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse
demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a
paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to
reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social
biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to
responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models
rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to
assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible
assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,
human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to
replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in
text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization
of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct
text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a
given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use
Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,
respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair
Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that
most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated
solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find
better hyperparameters.

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web

that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated,
real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step
reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and
coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with
reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating
design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content.
These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need
for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents
capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing
methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel
objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel
framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with
no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to
bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting
attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such
research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D
object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA
incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature
concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for
attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal
flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets
show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection
while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate

This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network

architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The
architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,
thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These
findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a
two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)
encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps
these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation
of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate
spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling
approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based
methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability.
Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still
suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes
RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation
paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as
geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves
dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training
stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed
fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss,
accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field
methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces
training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels,
offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across
various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In
the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding
of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on
enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial
potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness
and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we
introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR)
benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along
with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects,
including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action
prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent
specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character
dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based
method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant
challenges with this task.

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning
large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when
maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc,
training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update
induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta
weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized
nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank
truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction
fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be
re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is
simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments
on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial
compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,
SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of
personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject
customizations.

Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era
where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on
social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment
perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three
perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from
images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on
automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on
sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established
benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach,
achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and
Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively,
across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity
categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these
new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up,
which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential
of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing,
while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the
loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing
clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to
incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack
effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,
we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,
designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text
perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a
global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract
overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting
generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,
the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to
concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,
thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to
constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network
learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby
promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by
sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the
ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are
obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans
typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at
an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a
multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we
model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five
technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of
human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is
initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the
respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.
Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible
training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to
better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual
dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves
superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image
restoration tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/YaoShunyu19/MDIQA.

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects
look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry
from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion
priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play
framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS
defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features
and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry
toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated
seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts,
achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual
recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for
learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and
variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich
complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional
feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to
reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal
classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the
Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that
integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.
Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet
Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement
Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature
representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and
global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these
multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,
equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.
Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by
identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the
simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the
most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps
achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently
surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with
configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)
to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in
advancing feature representation learning.

Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac

recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols,
holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its
reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders
population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and
Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening
using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late
Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific
pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently
optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by
an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates
task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on
multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI:
0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while
eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for
wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency

generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization
approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which
require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D
content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable
direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces.
However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images
preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our
approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations
and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned
3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding
aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and
personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the
need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our

Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves
training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and
adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we
build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a
method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often
disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,
leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts
the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,
neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively
disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for
transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41
diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates
that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in
cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking
capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates
within just 10 queries. Our code is available at:

limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce
HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured

Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for
action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step,
from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus
enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical
Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to
learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action
quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures
the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward
based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable
assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains
challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity.
Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient
generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze
distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these
limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing
Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios.
RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST)
strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov
chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient
conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising
Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising
timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly
managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four
real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential
characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd
counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This
characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use
the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field.
This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting:
emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and
design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The
main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that
applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning
design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density
levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model
to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model
shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on
the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its
ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold
immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in
processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their
practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common
visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent
in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely
overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on
visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we
introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach
designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such
conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency
Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed
versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a
consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics,
Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC),
to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first
large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically
augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source
LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with
perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various
tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc
However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making
regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare
observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we
reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To
tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the
generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely,
given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model
performance changes according to the loss values of different target
observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced
Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization
ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular,
we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a
novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability
across the observation space, which guarantees a theoretical generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks, including age
and depth estimation, demonstrate that our BSAM method consistently outperforms
existing approaches. The code is available

Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained
Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement
Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator
to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an
adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for
robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but
suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While
recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal
extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the
failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this
problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework
that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools
with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative
approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian
characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially
theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We
further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability
while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding
baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video
generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the
appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize
inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related
categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large
Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic
inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level
contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.
This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors
while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among
visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its
traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex
environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and
repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting
(GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate
fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We
propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured
marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for
efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within
cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional
image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We
further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This
agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of
dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of
perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world
applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve
impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time
and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples
and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In
particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions
that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when
the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an
orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original
positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts
while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet
plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which
relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,
DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To
control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a
triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process
is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on
the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both
content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and
challenging writing styles.

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision,
Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The
sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers
their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)
model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed
representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model
incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages
these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby
enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level
video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the
probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features.
Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs),
cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the
need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based
on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to
extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization
across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains
(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep
CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic
feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,
especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)
compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding
discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends
to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM
integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)
module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential
overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization
techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which
enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and
a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel
Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789
FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust

matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring,
smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained
Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language
model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance
through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces
two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal
fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual
descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based
re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients
to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text
encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving
~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption
scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally,
we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger
counterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: 3D mapping in dynamic environments poses a challenge for modern researchers

classifying contemporary approaches based on scene types and representations,
learning methods, and practical applications. Using this taxonomy, a brief
structured analysis of recent methods is provided. The article also describes
an original modular method called M3DMap, designed for object-aware
construction of multimodal 3D maps for both static and dynamic scenes. It
consists of several interconnected components: a neural multimodal object
segmentation and tracking module; an odometry estimation module, including
trainable algorithms; a module for 3D map construction and updating with
various implementations depending on the desired scene representation; and a
multimodal data retrieval module. The article highlights original
implementations of these modules and their advantages in solving various
practical tasks, from 3D object grounding to mobile manipulation. Additionally,
it presents theoretical propositions demonstrating the positive effect of using
multimodal data and modern foundational models in 3D mapping methods. Details

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on
high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from
extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing
point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus
demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To
address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel
interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense
supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to
guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding
condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as
the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete
the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In
addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features
from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental
perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting
arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input
from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal
domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer
from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To
leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow
($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a
$\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost,
regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces
challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion
inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to
enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency
Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow
achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$
faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while
also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape
the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative
engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological
breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have
significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true
photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a
major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In
this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of
rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we
propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative
Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image
translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that
transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.
This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time
inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach
achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired
Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also
indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced
by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to
translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of
real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns

generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map
semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while
separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are
hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast,
proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize
global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses
this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution
separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant
computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a
novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical
framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine
and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational
efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss,
offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across
various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification,
demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding
optimization, with potential for broader applications.

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to
generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.
Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with
dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain
(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our
design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding
boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are
then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts
to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the
system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with
GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and
points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation
models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive
annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains
reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained
segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test
sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to
54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust
generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors
can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be

combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and

diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

Abstract: Natural disasters pose significant challenges to timely and accurate damage
assessment due to their sudden onset and the extensive areas they affect.
Traditional assessment methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and hazardous
to personnel, making them impractical for rapid response, especially in
resource-limited settings. This study proposes a novel, cost-effective
framework that leverages aerial drone footage, an advanced AI-based video
super-resolution model, Video Restoration Transformer (VRT), and Gemma3:27b, a
27 billion parameter Visual Language Model (VLM). This integrated system is
designed to improve low-resolution disaster footage, identify structural
damage, and classify buildings into four damage categories, ranging from
no/slight damage to total destruction, along with associated risk levels. The
methodology was validated using pre- and post-event drone imagery from the 2023
Turkey earthquakes (courtesy of The Guardian) and satellite data from the 2013
Moore Tornado (xBD dataset). The framework achieved a classification accuracy
of 84.5%, demonstrating its ability to provide highly accurate results.
Furthermore, the system's accessibility allows non-technical users to perform
preliminary analyses, thereby improving the responsiveness and efficiency of
disaster management efforts.

Abstract: Traditional video-based learning remains passive, offering limited
opportunities for users to engage dynamically with content. While current
AI-powered tools offer transcription and summarization, they lack real-time,
region-specific interaction capabilities. This paper introduces Untwist, an
AI-driven system that enables interactive video learning by allowing users to
ask questions about the entire video or specific regions using a bounding box,
receiving context-aware, multimodal responses. By integrating GPT APIs with
Computer Vision techniques, Untwist extracts, processes, and structures video
content to enhance comprehension. Our approach addresses GPT-4o spatial
weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data,
significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content.
This paper describes the system architecture, including video pre-processing
and real-time interaction, and outlines how Untwist can transform passive video
consumption into an interactive, AI-driven learning experience with the
potential to enhance engagement and comprehension.

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools
for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe
(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused
by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions
and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to
imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,
which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical
subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation
method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to
accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to
isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.
Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation
model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted
using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic
method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment
and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the
biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU
participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without
increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more
accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide
more accurate measures for disease tracking.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object
changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations
(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in
paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)
classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense
annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as
image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,
WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,
especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an
Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise
problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each
training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using
incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.
This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,
namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as
object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these
adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an
online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted
moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP
can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding
additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment
Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance
enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to
other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces
both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given
text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task,
we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality
datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images
with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent
instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying
the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images
and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the
image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective
rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references
within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal
pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher
quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which
consider captions and images separately. We release our code at:

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data
fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data,
such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost
or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online
distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to
enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained
histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data
during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or
both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract
modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To
maintain the internal structural relationships between samples,
Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,
Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual
learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and
complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC
biomarker prediction using uni-modal data. Our code is available at

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics
have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot
learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are
mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However,
due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a
universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a
general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations
as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training
framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training
objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model
as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets
directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average
success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP
pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning
methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud
encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger
Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various
robot tasks. Our project page is available at: https://4d-

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of
joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped
image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints
cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding
camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D
objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding
(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the
human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective
relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,
which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject
deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the
cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a
transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,
thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of
model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,
PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M
datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an
MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination
of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security
threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible
watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense
against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,
they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which
proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define
and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first
time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of
watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or
removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To
address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named
Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network
architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and
introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse
and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain
the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second
embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS
training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing
methods against MEA.

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,

propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual

the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning
and a prompt-based baseline.

Abstract: Adversarial distillation (AD) is a knowledge distillation technique that
facilitates the transfer of robustness from teacher deep neural network (DNN)
models to lightweight target (student) DNN models, enabling the target models
to perform better than only training the student model independently. Some
previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to
improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts
learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge
transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel
Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT,
dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness
to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as
part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more
actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our
approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our
observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a
certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various
adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a
critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion
paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature
interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on
transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented
to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and
distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A
transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to
reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle
the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident
prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable
template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments
validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with
the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching
real-time speed.

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot

Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and
domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven
approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image
segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework,
QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and
performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million
possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass
segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that
QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses
AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within
three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as
well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model
adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks. Code available at:

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in
multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to
decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step
logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark
limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,
human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering
a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims
to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of
compositional visual reasoning research.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation
exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite
significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing
DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical
region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical
heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their
generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we
propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable
LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff
employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive
denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language
image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy
perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn
continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify
salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware
diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by
synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP
into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)
based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing
eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising
performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the
remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate
user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to
scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation,
highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this
end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting
custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding
transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the
structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the
Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background
image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising,
positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in
the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner
Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize
identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural
consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its
practical value and potential for broad adoption.

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS
2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition
specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs
including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025,
participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that
in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most
segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that
our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good
performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is
to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we
identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems
exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile
predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three
technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler
SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided
distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath
unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and
segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us
to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear
margins. Code and models will be released at

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to
social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods
primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake
contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals
in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake
detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more
sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations
within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized
perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in
non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts
preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then
introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture
perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the
promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and
producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an
efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for
photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that
convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method
that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions
(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image
rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding
material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of
measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial
Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across
wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to
leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.
Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from
limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data
will be released upon acceptance.

show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and
exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key
limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning,

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images
poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often
trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that
do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common
practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard
network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies
risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding
information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this
paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),
a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution
local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features
are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction,
ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for
detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI
manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization
(TFL) module for fine-grained spatial sensitivity and JPEG Quality Factor
Estimation (QFE) module to disentangle generative artifacts from compression
noise explicitly. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we introduce
HiRes-50K, a new challenging benchmark consisting of 50,568 images with up to
64 megapixels. Extensive experiments show that HiDA-Net achieves
state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy by over 13% on the challenging Chameleon

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques
for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These
studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to
use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level
priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for
leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the
diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on
outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the
variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion
model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the
features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these
observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching
strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and
how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of
two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a
shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in
real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)
Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on
shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current
feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate
DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual
fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models
including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image
generation.

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by

methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology)

literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized
with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal
is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only
general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able
to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical
multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel
analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved
images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these
cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval
models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these
challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that
while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top
retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle,
and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room
for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a
significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion.
Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in
unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural
coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on
facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos,
limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To
overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of
human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance
generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure
generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining
video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated
structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human
structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate
dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the
limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human
video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image
segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation
remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning
of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive
parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome
these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise
Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and
Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving
interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as
dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables
without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty
estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations
via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to
boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets
demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image),
(ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\%
vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four
critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability,

advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications. The source code

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising
zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to
domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches
primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and
visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual
descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts
and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt
enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing
comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic
perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:
Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic
Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of
incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates
synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and
constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy
and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual
noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative
regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,
effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.
Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual
prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time
adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual
alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial
compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on
registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at
least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while
multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima
between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping
registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation
is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and
a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via
BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.
Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere
parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated
through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.
Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D
RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved
deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment
tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time
complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the
number of points, even in the worst case.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering
high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex
degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models
(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative
priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process
incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time
applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and
TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their
large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,
a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that
achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We
introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy
to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE
compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.
We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching
techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces
computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%
parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high
quality results.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models,
real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that
existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular
instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications,
and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This
paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent
framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative,
and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual
understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction
parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner
for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative
image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop.
To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new
benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing
instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for
Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and
3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of
iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to
instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in
delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view
surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction
step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh
aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh
representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes
an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework
while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility.
Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that
does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening
applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global
geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization
constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy
and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated
and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds,
with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods.
Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture
editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination
of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach
a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering.

Abstract: Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a
critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual
worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as
elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene
optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this
problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural
network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual
features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network
can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a
learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic
physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also
collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and
physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is
about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time
optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our
method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever
been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has
been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been
substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on
limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same
distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object
detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark
with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed
large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator.
Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different
ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within
each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance
features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation
scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality
adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the
impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce
several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for
domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may
propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains. Our

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a
formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of
existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal
dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual
features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer
(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT
employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for
spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The
latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,
including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal
Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual
cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through
sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic
fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event
graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a
comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal
calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to
understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on
ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3
and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition

barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained
industrial applications.

Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers
by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing
fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,
both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this
dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,
which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic
parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained
to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal
foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this
issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights
to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving
generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the
tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these
sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the
transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior
performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art
techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing

While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast

Abstract: For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made
substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments
through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of
battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes
frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we
introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently
updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with
only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose
estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change
detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is
then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are
seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates
human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement,
with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update
time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining
up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but
suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While
recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying
these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality
degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical
acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the
multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon,
wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers
yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts
hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a
patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With
patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric
computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a
linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This
completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward
networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with
minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion
acceleration methods.

backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and
diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion
module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support
downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a
two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to
enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized
answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our
64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of
66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and
spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an
80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved
performance on spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We present HotSpotter, a fast, accurate algorithm for identifying individual
animals against a labeled database. It is not species specific and has been
applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
"hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each
database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and
ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local
Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query
image in just a few seconds.

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and
enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing
methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the
predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive
domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global
scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores
can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly
predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13
sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and
systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on
model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are
group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with
more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for
CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting
underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework
offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end
MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human
body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor
generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose
JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free
Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by
integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional
fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our
approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference
person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through
dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention
layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and
attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person
integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional
generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based
model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''
model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment
images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing
iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate
that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks
including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong
generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and
prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus
on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive
value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive
decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that
jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at
Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and
Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those
associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,
an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer
(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are
fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our
results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score
prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1
(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently
dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential
sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.
Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,
where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more
complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved
multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced
learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and
provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD
prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical
assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation
methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement
process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field
of view, and an inability to capture wound depth, especially in anatomically
complex or curved regions. To overcome these limitations, we present
Wound3DAssist, a practical framework for 3D wound assessment using monocular
consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short
handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic
measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We
integrate 3D reconstruction, wound segmentation, tissue classification, and
periwound analysis into a modular workflow. We evaluate Wound3DAssist across
digital models with known geometry, silicone phantoms, and real patients.
Results show that the framework supports high-quality wound bed visualization,
millimeter-level accuracy, and reliable tissue composition analysis. Full
assessments are completed in under 20 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for
real-world clinical use.

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects
visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified
sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads
to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in
substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual
information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence
length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within
the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower
visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an
efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and
fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the
inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and
language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it
dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic
granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The
fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being
directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding
layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also
dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small
number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of
cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted
experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering
on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate
that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and
inference.

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly
challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data
and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one
of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use
either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much
consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the
imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to
solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed
to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too
computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having
detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a
novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance
while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of
0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to
other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the
loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive
comparisons with other popular loss functions

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet
most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural

to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To
address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale

disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing
models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then
propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that
integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection
(DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a
client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training.
FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the
FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability,
we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it
demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work
provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly
generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale
agricultural AI applications.

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and
computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical
visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms
struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases
such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to
undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy.
Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure
their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion
based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based
Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real
clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure
completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection
Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple
dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure
accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive
experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and
PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for
point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal
pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although
recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated
detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal
glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of
diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not
without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological
characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the
most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the
choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for
fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of
accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed
to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of
regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both
long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art
models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design
that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions
encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that
intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and
efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by
reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a
multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the
understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable
insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical
workflows in the digital pathology domain.

hierarchical visual information to cope with challenging unknown diseases that
resemble known diseases. Specifically, a cross-scale visual fusion strategy is
proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and

CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively
evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level
labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and
pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that
the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S,
with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM
achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong
accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without
segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f

detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet
challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the
garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality
geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit
representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry
and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods
model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which
results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural
Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured
garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive
remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles
and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we
learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We
provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate
significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality
garment reconstructions.

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance
or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users'
actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across
long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment
Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,
comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As
a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue
retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each
naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in
real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising
real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on
these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image
fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,
these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within
retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval
model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject
fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning
with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and
contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally
dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum
sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and
gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in
long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain
and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions
given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically
follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each
action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder
scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is
often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these
limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with
few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation
space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a
given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve
inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a
generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation
model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy
specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive
experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings,
regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but
existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint
detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due
to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these
challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint
detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the
keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and
compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a
gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss
function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built
new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our
method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method
achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing
methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss
function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,
improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For
3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of
0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and
reliability. The code and dataset are available at

Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as
backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis
of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented
reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases,
learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual
question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior
literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how
pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that
bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is
computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained
models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias,
finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally,
we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current
paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge
when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights
into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias
mitigation practices.

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their
intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on
diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to
produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image
generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and
interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining
approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich
implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion
models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and
have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an
interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the
interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing
global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and
detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of
the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with
more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network
which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging
multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network
to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves
image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than
the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their
interaction control.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational
efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face
significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common
occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial
settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where
meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation
capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive
evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean
conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and
92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight
RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to
detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a
practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect
data curation is challenging.

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose,

this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and
handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and
regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to
substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation
quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number
of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in
visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the
computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The
text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token
pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.
However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing
later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's
output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens
corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning
that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we
present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency
bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting
mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their
spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual
Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model
architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal
computational overhead.

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the

Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction
quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional
robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image

limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly
incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to
simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal

consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19
employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both
the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video
degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a
temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to
facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we
embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss
to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative
evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal
consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on
public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and
pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates
dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable
for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior

have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to
capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of
generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and
detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these
issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for
fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine
hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture
placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained
layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and
horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into
multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization
network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation
errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically
plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating
realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the
field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications
requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication
to encourage future research.

Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive
Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection

data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The
TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining
camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this

synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation.
Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation

most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image
with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and
labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe
that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making
the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced
sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling,
so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL
and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose
a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo
labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection
strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by
text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively
aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual
information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate
the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,
achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single

inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose
estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches
rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks,
requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully
retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose
from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less
accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose
refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as
GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing
3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be
directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines
the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and
multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature
extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical
evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches,
achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors
on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on
CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results
establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective
solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for
real-world applications in automated content verification and digital

Abstract: We introduce ISALux, a novel transformer-based approach for Low-Light Image
Enhancement (LLIE) that seamlessly integrates illumination and semantic priors.
Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination
and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates
illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction.
ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination
and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance
and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of
Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning,
with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for
specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by
distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA
module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that
ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an
ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed
model. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language
models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization
(APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only
input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks,
such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual
token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity
and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level
supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and
overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present
UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework
tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process
that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization
more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges,
we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates
context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for
effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text,
image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and
transferable prompt optimization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in
minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth
estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying
illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful
visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural
images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic
perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce
EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively
integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth
estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The
framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates
Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a
Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve
the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a
mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical
tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and
EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting
surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby
enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for
augmented reality and navigation systems.

novel comprehensive large-scale multi-view video dataset for rPPG and health
biomarkers estimation. Our dataset comprises 3600 synchronized video recordings
from 600 subjects, captured under varied conditions (resting and post-exercise)
using multiple consumer-grade cameras at different angles. To enable multimodal
analysis of physiological states, each recording is paired with a 100 Hz PPG
signal and extended health metrics, such as electrocardiogram, arterial blood
pressure, biomarkers, temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and
stress level. Using this data, we train an efficient rPPG model and compare its
quality with existing approaches in cross-dataset scenarios. The public release

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video
understanding.

22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical
University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar.
Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel,
fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and
3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects,
respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT
images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',
and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data
refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut
through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were
rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance
was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index
measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices
results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input
data dimensions.

Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input
images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under
extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large
number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a
feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene
regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our
method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor
images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input
images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive
experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale
scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose
estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and
Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which
safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous
driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection
under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing
structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However,
challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce
data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety
violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision
architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road
environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode
framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a
five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved
the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road
images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better
road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust
forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely
localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show
promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for
context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level
forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper
presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic
reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach
utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation
analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic
understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we
introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and
refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis,
integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally,
we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic
cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic
biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By
synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established
forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals
are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence,
resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization
capabilities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any
labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve
FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based
on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the
presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk
enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under
FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD)
framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training
set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific
student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where
pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively
guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all
samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance
improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD
setting.

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensics is one of the processes to identify
victims of crime and natural disasters. Identifying an individual from their
remains plays a crucial role when all other identification methods fail.
Traditional methods for this task, such as clay-based craniofacial
reconstruction, require expert domain knowledge and are a time-consuming
process. At the same time, other probabilistic generative models like the
statistical shape model or the Basel face model fail to capture the skull and
face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a
generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here,
we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune
the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two
distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the
first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by
generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the
quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have
proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and
the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have
found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in

have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and
employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation
stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which
stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal
policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance
(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process
refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate
guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a
visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on
GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%,
5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the
proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to
the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models
capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing
methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning
mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of
cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and
imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed
Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive
scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought
framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning
within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three
cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive
prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic
maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background
disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning
and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling
precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting:
Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating
cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative
point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny.
Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical
Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional
efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for
comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object
categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses
significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)
offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images
are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with
vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often
relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this
paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free
open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,
a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details
from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any
task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias
Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch
features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components
empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained
VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the
framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,
where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce
AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer
semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the
need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS
across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR
datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the
SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and
open-world Earth observation.

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in
event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high
temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or
undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction
typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and
therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300
FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose
EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates
high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and
physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low
sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking
network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To
capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with
a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a
bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at
a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit
of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in
two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and
demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event
simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale
event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based
vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and VRAR.

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify
image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be
classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the
open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on
distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and
rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.
They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the
samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for
discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few
labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes
of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.
Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class
classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples
into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown
class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive
experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as
Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three
reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM),
Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional
Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize
the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel
initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train
SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of
both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed
methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future
research on generative models.

Abstract: The urgent need for renewable energy expansion, particularly wind power, is
hindered by conflicts with wildlife conservation. To address this, we developed
BirdRecorder, an advanced AI-based anti-collision system to protect endangered
birds, especially the red kite (Milvus milvus). Integrating robotics,
telemetry, and high-performance AI algorithms, BirdRecorder aims to detect,
track, and classify avian species within a range of 800 m to minimize
bird-turbine collisions.
  BirdRecorder integrates advanced AI methods with optimized hardware and
software architectures to enable real-time image processing. Leveraging Single
Shot Detector (SSD) for detection, combined with specialized hardware
acceleration and tracking algorithms, our system achieves high detection
precision while maintaining the speed necessary for real-time decision-making.
By combining these components, BirdRecorder outperforms existing approaches in
both accuracy and efficiency.
  In this paper, we summarize results on field tests and performance of the
BirdRecorder system. By bridging the gap between renewable energy expansion and
wildlife conservation, BirdRecorder contributes to a more sustainable
coexistence of technology and nature.

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual

remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently

editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative
models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical

hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often
hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing
task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at

outperforming smaller
  models with equivalent memory requirements like the Molmo-7B series. The
system maintains

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based
CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical
imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black
boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge
management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz
AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art
explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a
seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack
analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily
incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for
outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making
the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes
observability and responsible deployment of computer vision systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry
of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object
interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion
model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to
optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible
hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive
post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly
generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by
introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we
guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while
simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object
being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues,
including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint
reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and
enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical
plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and
coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild
scenarios.

Abstract: Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive
performance on tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and visual
reasoning, but their high computational cost hinders deployment in
latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. We introduce GM-Skip, a
flexible and metric-adaptive framework for Transformer block skipping that
accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality. GM-Skip features a
greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g.,
accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order
deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid
performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a
tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance
objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and
CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining
task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object
classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3
percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In
real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on
single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running
Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and
confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their
vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries
can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to
generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in
classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective
mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the
model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned
outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach,
Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses
knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned
prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the
backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using
the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the
attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches,
achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based
attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings
highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative
models. Code and model weights can be found at

Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has

assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that
researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further
limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these
generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse
Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation
metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically
describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more
than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE
demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in
synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further
provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key
dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical
plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences
invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical
plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with
human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,
LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model
selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These
capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in
AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI
applications.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps
short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera.
The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths
and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and
uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to
ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single
versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully
calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without
calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with
corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and
intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete
priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results
show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that
the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available,
and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D
joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state
of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed,
the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it
suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a
query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We
accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene
features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image
features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in
three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by
applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our
method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization
without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We
evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive
localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing
3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel
scenes without additional training.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in
understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual
input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the
degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been
proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only
unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent
multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic
criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this
limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to
select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first
formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.
Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and
the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be
adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision
pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark
datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text
information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass
the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage
criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while
maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,
with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original
performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of
coverage in token selection.

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,

Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the
inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred
textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These
inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and
realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high
fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of
high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D
image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of
state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D
objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose
an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,
we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the
quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that
compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and
fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of
0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for
practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications. Project page:

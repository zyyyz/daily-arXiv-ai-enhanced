Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative
diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,
state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled
text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy
and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending
these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant
challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing
subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply
image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally
inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent
advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent
diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal
causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot
or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with
priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for
automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction
quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong
measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.
Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show
significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that
apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both
reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with
practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely
described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of
stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual
conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on
how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model,
by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given
stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the
generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream
generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image
generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style
extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a
style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual
representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide
generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset,
whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions,
to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is
crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of
effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of
struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to
determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing
manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In
this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68
hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle
segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped
into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and
shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,
participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of
skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action
localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle
segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal
Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even
when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall
average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across
activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various
skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in
struggle detection. Our dataset is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient
foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide
range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing
state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer
architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a
lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely
underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable
effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet
powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the
behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is
pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6
challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based
architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks
while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data,
highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving
diverse PDE systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on
multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting
individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the
first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human
generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image
facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii)
enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through
human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as
complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans
Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global
Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g.,
Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our
results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves
the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark
for compositional multi-human generation.

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location
of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned
representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active
research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning
the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic
representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world
as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach
to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its
semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main
experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics
measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional
ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the
combination of geographic and visual representations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training
datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative
examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models
and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can
outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose
the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We
prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during
instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model
parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model
during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters
examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their
attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a
balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in
large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can
discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while
fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and
speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to
the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for
vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical
supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts
Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical
posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the
continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous
methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling
uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled
generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training
converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching
baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models.
This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge
continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency
in image generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic
aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,
including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce
contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating
synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a
multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs
segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared
semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep
learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while
simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach
integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,
enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical
segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires
no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder
and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training
strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common
constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of
264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task
and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61
dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,
it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus
Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to
more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm
from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to
nnU-Net. Code is available at https://github.com/yuxuanou623/AortaDiff.git.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and
require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with
pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource
models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging.
In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping
pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a
pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a
temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a
frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and
supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new
domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods
remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM
reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by
contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations
like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools),
a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable
invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust
implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning
discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and
content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level
execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call
search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from
fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena
and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less
LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for
browser automation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures
from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in
histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To
address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework
designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our
method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic
dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency
across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish
biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key
challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological
features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome
this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap
with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces
topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations
essential for reliable downstream analysis. Code is available at

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness
for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences.
Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its
computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its
applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences.
The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed.
In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked
information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise
comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective
framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with
listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list
of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the
Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire
ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked
alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO
across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and
personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms
pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language
models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified
MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing
such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous
embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality
images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive
approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but
often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In
this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments
pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a
Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and
generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve
visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete
representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel
tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual
details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments
across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves
competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation
benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time
compared to prior unified MLLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a
particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access.
Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist
due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage
of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while
promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced
reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate
overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with
limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that
combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for
oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs
variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty
quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by
smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method
achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of
the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for
real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations
differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior
generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%
for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed
that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly
classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified
samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in
data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving
model reliability and generalizability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of
adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.
However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic
invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily
focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely
resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain
with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples
and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant
Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue
by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.
Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain
diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,
which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing
diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature
representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be
used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples
to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max
mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same
category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted
on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and
DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our
proposed approaches. Code is available at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual
interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because
of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations.
However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy
descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as
users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific
information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant
information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users
questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual
contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide
the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with
three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions
showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users'
questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of
comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from
undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite
solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,
prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or
learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors
typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,
we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel
class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in
the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection
of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two
key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the
null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information
orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing
process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,
compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to
conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on
convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.
Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors
consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse
problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed
tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,
unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological
priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs
into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical
utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art
classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more
favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging
the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making,
this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language
understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and
cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current
VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final
actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations.
Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying
primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these
challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates
Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and
execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with
verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output
formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy.
Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides
chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory
annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain,
simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior
generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We
plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this
work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website:

Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and
3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information.
However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that
heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D
reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large
number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D
reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint
deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from
multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of
the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework
adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of
the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from
a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve
high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and
transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion
models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for
high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger
generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,
challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still
limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce
FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity
deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where
each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a
consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By
reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns
temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance
model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation
and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior
performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based
methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff
offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to
high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for
further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications. Our
dataset and code will be available at https://github.com/xyLiu339/FideDiff.

Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial
stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for
archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition
remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability
across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed
character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI
dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters
spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.
Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition
pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual
characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the
pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with
ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger
robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page
recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy
across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.
These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition
and downstream archaeological analysis.

Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for
every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training
parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also
preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases,
we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation
via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full
backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the
backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias
to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize
these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that
optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when
domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require
modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused
across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M
trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art
parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its
parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans
and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8%
of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods
(PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only
2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet
existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are
constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we
introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven
alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from
3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant
expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively
disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode
these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a
shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial
deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures
more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.
We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level
psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression
detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned
tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and
strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked
Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider
variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and
effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing
applications.

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing
the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization
and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel
method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing
isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise
reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based
framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as
locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the
conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately
computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples
constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other
approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity
of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative
optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,
utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D
point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing
approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website:

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of
reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some
recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and
perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D
scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations
for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to
decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and
reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this
end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based
on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent
images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion
model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D
scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view
degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from
large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image
inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of
our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style
of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching
requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state
(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream
operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and
scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,
most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without
explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world
deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end
framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and
geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and
independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic
Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to
guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise
separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable
geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based
augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight
refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local
optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms
inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong
robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly
suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications. The code is

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they
frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of
fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during
image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has
shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the
reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details
during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often
overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual
details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for
adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level
operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply
operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in
textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided
reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own
responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be
invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal
reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while
significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model
achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of
only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by
66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR)
interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often
show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not
reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on
confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with
subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level
consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose
an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify
error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm
15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO
encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where
highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$)
despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for
selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in
medical AI.

Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a
challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts
temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a
dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free
video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style
details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized
references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating
the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers
and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to
constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues
to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive
evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal
consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human
preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution
for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization. The code and videos

Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate

process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce
MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning
paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary
tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via
human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)
MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,
aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The
benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,
totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering
diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with
simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated
images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging
protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further
conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement
with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates
that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,
with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight
the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that
MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential
of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image,
InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the
instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer
relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that
semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient
representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,
scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains
difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by
partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)
partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits
do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines
fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model
and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel
Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers
the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning
method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based
strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational
load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and
selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on
large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves
up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art
baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to
scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains
linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct
Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves
training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during
inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the
context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing
the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that
it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence
distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the
calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two
auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the
dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We
evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet
and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for
calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the
best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and
secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be
jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same
method.

Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification
by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped

backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context
and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely
on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification,
leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In
this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a
novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating
the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of
diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided
Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii)
Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and
(iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage
text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but
remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of
reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although
compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate
reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine
spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU),
which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI
reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding
framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean
velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more
robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the
interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of
flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show
that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction
quality. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/YiAi03/FMU.

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality
inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this
paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line
package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and
a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP
are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack
of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To
solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset
for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated
(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.
The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in
accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to
threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture
is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established
with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety
inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between
normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under
category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual
encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to
learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly
amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt
embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed
FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the
natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for
anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in
an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class
detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer
parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple
foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the
perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly
detection.

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization
across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world
robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent
works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image
complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to
dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision
Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our
architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the
network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a
Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach
achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different
datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent
years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect
representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which
limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a
unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and
diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),
derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly
with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's
outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior
methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically
expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation
among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by
randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust
per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual
perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving
state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM
models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the
inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of
product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through
'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality
is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in
agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,
timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional
absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose
the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from
'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',
designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports
trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through
multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the
Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness
Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization
Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes
process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.
Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than
baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the
framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This
research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building
a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from
algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges
with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with
handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose
4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first
introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal
consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from
the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures
during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module
that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while
jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the
consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,
which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.
Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective
4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent
understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic
editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our
framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a
logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user
commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works,
our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our
code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from
low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep
learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the
pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods
and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities
according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations
remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial
inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking
mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive
computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into
distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while
maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art
ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal
overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and
parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was
implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,
structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,
iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding
generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A
comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,
borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,
and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved
output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates
for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the
successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to
five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because
of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative
finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number
identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive
lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is
required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable
approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral
patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,
time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral
responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan
Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated
multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based
video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial
metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,
tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,
including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat
associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,
drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,
reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher
accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,
analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional
methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,
vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains
zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit
strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and
observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and
giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at
scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing
conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape
and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely
on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured
data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.
The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors
3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent
transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware
constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic
correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains
structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This
integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence
throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our
proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior
2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by
26.2%. Project page: https://baiyunshu.github.io/GAUSSIANMORPHING.github.io/

Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical
monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the
backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture
long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures.
Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for
generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor
Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework
for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer
at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual
reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy
and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective
modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion
refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor
details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and
scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.
Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent
gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of
transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor
segmentation.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s
is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study
bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract
urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which
produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this
pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to
handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The
first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that
identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data
augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output
of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces
false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method
processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan
France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively
capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels
and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the
resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term
urbanization dynamics.

the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy
videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and
L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with
segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is
competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical
targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.
Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking
outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and
placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic
Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant
challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is
unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to
labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision
Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task,
FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset
and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data,
without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a
framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and
language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by
CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a
weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on
pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and
clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively
tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established
domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for

groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates
fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative
visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that
ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to
3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D
features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing
geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale
annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant
segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with
3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the
2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated
features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small
Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using
geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During
inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the
point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from
latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify
effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.
Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify
achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about
1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it
supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking.
However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips,
are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for
small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric
identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein
patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed
pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a
standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision
pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and
spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then
classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision
across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to
classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating
feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile
physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides
farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.
More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein
biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to
extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and
occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a
multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid
vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built
on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a
segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk
at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks
demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting
approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11
underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The
method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains,
demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset,
highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable
ecological insights.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap
by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in
structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear
practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning
(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To
address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that
introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,
enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding
skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to
improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware
reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse
rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL
scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning
tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus
demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent
performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover,
models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6
benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and
general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding
and reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target
region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,
are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image
manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow
matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly
stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based
editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the
first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based
editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first
show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:
unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently
structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To
overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,
where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature
supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization
adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving
background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.
For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)
featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on
DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and
region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image
editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a
variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the
"needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced
from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions
alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing
token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal
dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In
this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and
demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,
which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To
maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token
footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically
balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count
per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our
training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and
10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These
results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame
selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world
video understanding applications. Project webpage is available at

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for
capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.
Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential
for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical
benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with
inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a
total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both
commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy
subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological
cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks
(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA
BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using
OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17
keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,
achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg
\pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$)
and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The
results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic
assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and
sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This
study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically
promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based
estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians
seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for
telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision
technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms.
Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving
accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and
computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject
variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core
semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we
propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion:
AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter
is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to
emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we
pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully
connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This
enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject
on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for
fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local
cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse
global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.
Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model
(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach
overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training
framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using
fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)
within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided
$\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global
$\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we
introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via
multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,
and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned
with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which
convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to
iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent
fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy
gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy
optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and
insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and
AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully
designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then
fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target
temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing
benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies
further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales
behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving
unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer
architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when
extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive
formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from
short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models
cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their
training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from
the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in
long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video
teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on
exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the
student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.
Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to
20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure
and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous
methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of
generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the
maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x
longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and
our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially
outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency. Our long-horizon
videos demo can be found at https://self-forcing-plus-plus.github.io/

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are

creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control.
General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle
delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained
multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of
proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such
multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are
difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively
simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning
paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information
each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance
causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate
interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses
improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation
studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and
practicality of our work.

Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We

token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves
improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and
spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1)
reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention

the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often
fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions
than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are
currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative
to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key
technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this
limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across
resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal
from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a
train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that
recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.
NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and
is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable
Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly
improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and
Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by
10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent
artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each
physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well
as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer
the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the
visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer
vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and
trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and
self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in
a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though
behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other
models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with

framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling
dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through
stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as
control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic
algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base
velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight
fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal
while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior
attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion
correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed
for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and
Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject
alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs
efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited
prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal
Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art
multi-subject fidelity across models.

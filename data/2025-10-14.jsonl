In order to identify cell instances\nfrom foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose\ninstance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to\nforeground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the\ncenter point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the\ncenter point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped\npolygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric\nproperties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,\nwhich require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,\nwe present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),\nto leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into\ncell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic\nsegmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries\nwith a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary\nfeature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling\npixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the\nneighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is\nused to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary\nsignature.

Given an\nincomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an\ninitial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the\nscene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We\nconstruct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable\npriors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further\nrefinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying\nenvironments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is\ngeneralizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,\nsignificantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D\nenvironments.

Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either\non generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face\nsuper-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait\nphotos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general\nmodel processes the rest.

To overcome these limitations, we study the\nportrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a\nsingle-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and\nupscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner.

Through\nanalysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges\nthat affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting\nconditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these\nchallenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper.

To\nsupport this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising\n1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In\naddition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated\ntowards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training\nstrategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive\ntrajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize\ndecision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms\nstrong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the\n\"think\" to \"rethink\" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to\nclinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual\ntokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved\nperformance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative\nthinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of\nmedical AI."}

To\naddress this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for\ntracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a\nvision foundation model.

To address this\nlimitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time\nadaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement\nwithout requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion\nmodel under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural\nand sensor-level incompleteness.

These networks effortlessly identify and select\nfeatures in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to\ndetermine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box\",\nwhere users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical\nresults. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background\ninformation that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such\nhidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to\ndistinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore\nwhether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify\ndataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in\nsome situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it\nmore difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank\nbackground. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,\nnot necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were\ntested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid\ndatasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,\nnon-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,\nmaking classification more challenging. The second method involves the\napplication of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,\nand Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover\nbackground noise information used by CNN to classify images.

To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel\nend-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D\nrepresentations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of\nboth modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features\nfrom 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based\ngait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an\nintermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D\ngeometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational\nefficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually\nreconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where\nthe loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,\nand 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial\nalignment and consistent 3D structure.

This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement\ncapabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without\nexternal inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the\nself-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based\non a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,\nany masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The\nframework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation\nability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like\nimage$\\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\\rightarrow$question. (2) We\ngenerate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the\nTriangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further\nupdated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying\nmechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical\nanalysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as\nour baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve\nconsistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks\nwithout any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental\nfeedback.

Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated\nsignificant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;\nhowever, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a\nnovel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global\nand local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.\nSpecifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D\nselective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to\nefficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We\nfurther introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to\nenhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive\nexperiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model\noutperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better\ncomputational trade-offs."}

This leaves two open\nquestions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in\ntraining? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across\nvarying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples\ncontribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training\non the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU\ndistributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human\nuncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola\noperates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and\ntraining -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative\nones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\\% of data). Our approach\nsubstantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more\naccurate and better calibrated.

When applied to real-world\ndownstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data\nand out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both\ncovariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and\nsemantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the\nimportance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD\ndata, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In\nthis paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set\ndata when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly\nreducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel\nOOD score, named {\\Delta}Energy. {\\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the\nvanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD\ndetection. Furthermore, {\\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD\ngeneralization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound\nmaximization for {\\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to\nnot only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,\nwhich serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization.

Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have\nallowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can\naugment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like\nsemantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is\nlimited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.\n  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train\nControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control\nmechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the\ntraining distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types\nof control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an\nunlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The\nresulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty\nfrom the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution\nwith labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images\nfrom the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads\nto significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further\nsupervision.

However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,\nocclusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene\nInteraction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent\nSMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within\na shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse\nmonocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,\nfuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and\nsynthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted\noptimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly\nenforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D\nreprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible\nregions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only\n9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.\nIt naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse\ninteractions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing\nmean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,\nand improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic\nfoot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of\nheavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically\nplausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.\nOur implementation is publicly available at https://yuxuan-xue.com/physic."}

In this\nwork, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders\n(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term\nRepresentation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality\nreconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a\nscalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are\ntypically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers\nto operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,\npropose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically.

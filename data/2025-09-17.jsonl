We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January\n2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of\nT1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and\nsegmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D\nvisualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined\nsegmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.\nDice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and\nground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient\ninterviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97\n($\\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and\n0.82 ($\\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images.

Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often\nignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for\ngeometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that\nfuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass\ndermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale\napplication of GNNs to dermoscopy.

Pixels-per-millimeter are\nregressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.\nFrom lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of\ngyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry\nsimilarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs\nsemi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.\nResults.

Built upon this, we\nfurther propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables\nexclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style\nintensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor\noutperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets."}

SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to\nannotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or\ndirectly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We\nachieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,\nwhich allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate\nspatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur\nwithin the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language\nand specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D\nand 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe\napplicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth\n3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric\nmeasurements."}

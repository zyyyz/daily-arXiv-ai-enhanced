In this work, we propose the\nDiscriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address\nthese challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet\nefficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)\nnetwork, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a\nlightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each\nincremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new\nclasses, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the\ncurrent model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a\nresult, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different\nincremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable\ncomparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the\nDecoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and\nnegative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor.

Traditional prototype-based methods rely on\ndeterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations\nthat fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.\nThis work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that\nreformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space\nexploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability\ndistributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically\ncoherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates\nthrough three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement\nmodule that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via\nforward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism\nthat leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,\nand (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while\nmaximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference\nconsistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both\nphases.

This is the accepted manuscript version", "summary": "Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission\ntomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake\nquantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction\nare crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of\nneurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited\napplicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention\n(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.\nDL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET\nscans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate\nDL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,\n18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and\ngeneralization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and\nqualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free\nimages with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts\nthat are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest\nstandard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between\nDL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5\nplus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven\nPET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion\ncorrection accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings.

While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,\nvanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether\nthey are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under\nocclusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue\nthat uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views\nand time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited\nvisibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a\nnovel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates\nreliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to\nestimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a\nspatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization.

To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a\nself-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing\nUMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own\nunderstanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective\nsignals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional\nhuman-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a\nglobal-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity\nof images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \\textbf{global reward}\nensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a\n\\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity.

However, the conventional process for creating and\nanimating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,\nrequiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from\nprofessional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation\nmodels, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars\nfrom a single casually captured reference image of a target subject.

At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention\nPooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level\ndetails from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion\ngenerative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion\narchitectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of\nvisual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing.

This thesis presents a\nreal-time, inpainting-based DR system designed to enable privacy control in\nshared-space mixed reality (MR) meetings. The system allows a primary headset\nuser to selectively remove personal or sensitive items from their environment,\nensuring that those objects are no longer visible to other participants.\nRemoval is achieved through semantic segmentation and precise object selection,\nfollowed by real-time inpainting from the viewpoint of a secondary observer,\nimplemented using a mobile ZED 2i depth camera. The solution is designed to be\nportable and robust, requiring neither a fixed secondary viewpoint nor prior 3D\nscanning of the environment. The system utilises YOLOv11 for object detection\nand a modified Decoupled Spatial-Temporal Transformer (DSTT) model for\nhigh-quality video inpainting.

The system utilizes a\ndual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side\nview of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several\nparallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification\nusing ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth\nmovement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module\nemploys a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile\nphones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these\nmodules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network\nthat analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability\nscore. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse\nexam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying\nsuspicious activities.

This paper conducts an investigation of the impact\n(on performance and bias) on AI classification models of granularity in the FST\nscale. By training multiple AI models to classify benign vs. malignant lesions\nusing FST-specific data of differing granularity, we show that: (i) when\ntraining models using FST-specific data based on three groups (FST 1/2, 3/4 and\n5/6), performance is generally better for models trained on FST-specific data\ncompared to a general model trained on FST-balanced data; (ii) reducing the\ngranularity of FST scale information (from 1/2 and 3/4 to 1/2/3/4) can have a\ndetrimental effect on performance.

Recent works have focused on\nachieving this decomposition using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) or the 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation but remain hindered by two key\nlimitations: the high computational overhead associated with neural networks of\nNeRF and the use of low-frequency lighting representations, which often result\nin inefficient rendering and suboptimal relighting accuracy. We propose ROSGS,\na two-stage pipeline designed to efficiently reconstruct relightable outdoor\nscenes using the Gaussian Splatting representation. By leveraging monocular\nnormal priors, ROSGS first reconstructs the scene's geometry with the compact\n2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) representation, providing an efficient and\naccurate geometric foundation. Building upon this reconstructed geometry, ROSGS\nthen decomposes the scene's texture and lighting through a hybrid lighting\nmodel. This model effectively represents typical outdoor lighting by employing\na spherical Gaussian function to capture the directional, high-frequency\ncomponents of sunlight, while learning a radiance transfer function via\nSpherical Harmonic coefficients to model the remaining low-frequency skylight\ncomprehensively.

To tackle these challenges, we propose Autonomous Preference\nAlignment via Self-Injection (APASI), a novel and generalizable method that\nmitigates hallucinations without external dependencies. APASI leverages the\ntarget LVLM to self-inject hallucinations into a generated response, creating a\npair of responses with varying preference levels.

Moreover, APASI incorporates an iterative alignment training\nstrategy combined with curriculum learning to periodically update the\npreference data with increasing challenge, enabling stable and continuous\nenhancement of the LVLM.

As positive tissue\ncomprises only a small fraction of gigapixel WSIs, existing Multiple Instance\nLearning (MIL) methods typically focus on identifying salient instances via\nattention mechanisms. However, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify\ninstances while neglecting challenging ones. Recent studies have shown that\nhard examples are crucial for accurately modeling discriminative boundaries.\nApplying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework\nwith masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which utilizes a Siamese structure\nwith a consistency constraint to explore the hard instances. Using a\nclass-aware instance probability, MHIM-MIL employs a momentum teacher to mask\nsalient instances and implicitly mine hard instances for training the student\nmodel. To obtain diverse, non-redundant hard instances, we adopt large-scale\nrandom masking while utilizing a global recycle network to mitigate the risk of\nlosing key features. Furthermore, the student updates the teacher using an\nexponential moving average, which identifies new hard instances for subsequent\ntraining iterations and stabilizes optimization.

While most\nexisting SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting\nfavorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is\nidentified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's\nsemantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse\nSAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the\ninfluence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's\nparameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to\nstrengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers,\noriginally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training\nlayers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by\nlinear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules,\nSAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing\nadvantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD\ntask. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the\nproposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new\nbenchmark in the field. The code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/guobaoxiao/SAM-TTT."}

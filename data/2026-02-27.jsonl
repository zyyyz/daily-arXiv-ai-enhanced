However, current models capture not only biologically relevant features, but also pre-analytic and scanner-specific variation that bias the predictions of task-specific models trained from the foundation model features. Here we show that introducing novel robustness losses during training of downstream task-specific models reduces sensitivity to technical variability. A purpose-designed comprehensive experimentation setup with 27,042 WSIs from 6155 patients is used to train thousands of models from the features of eight popular foundation models for computational pathology. In addition to a substantial improvement in robustness, we observe that prediction accuracy improves by focusing on biologically relevant features. Our approach successfully mitigates robustness issues of foundation models for computational pathology without retraining the foundation models themselves, enabling development of robust computational pathology models applicable to real-world data in routine clinical practice."}

Experimental results demonstrate that MNAS-Unet outperforms NAS-Unet and other state-of-the-art models in segmentation accuracy on several medical image datasets, including PROMISE12, Ultrasound Nerve, and CHAOS. Furthermore, compared with NAS-Unet, MNAS-Unet reduces the architecture search budget by 54% (early stopping at 139 epochs versus 300 epochs under the same search setting), while achieving a lightweight model with only 0.6M parameters and lower GPU memory consumption, which further improves its practical applicability. These results suggest that MNAS-Unet can improve search efficiency while maintaining competitive segmentation accuracy under practical resource constraints."}

To this end, we present AeroDGS, a physics-guided 4D Gaussian splatting framework for monocular UAV videos. AeroDGS introduces a Monocular Geometry Lifting module that reconstructs reliable static and dynamic geometry from a single aerial sequence, providing a robust basis for dynamic estimation. To further resolve monocular ambiguity, we propose a Physics-Guided Optimization module that incorporates differentiable ground-support, upright-stability, and trajectory-smoothness priors, transforming ambiguous image cues into physically consistent motion. The framework jointly refines static backgrounds and dynamic entities with stable geometry and coherent temporal evolution. We additionally build a real-world UAV dataset that spans various altitudes and motion conditions to evaluate dynamic aerial reconstruction. Experiments on synthetic and real UAV scenes demonstrate that AeroDGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity in dynamic aerial environments."}

However, existing imaging modalities lack the necessary accuracy to reliably predict malignancy before surgical intervention. While deep learning has shown promise in malignancy prediction using 3D CT images, traditional approaches often rely on manual segmentation to isolate the tumor region and reduce noise, which enhances predictive performance. Manual segmentation, however, is labor-intensive, costly, and dependent on expert knowledge. In this study, a deep learning framework was developed utilizing an Organ Focused Attention (OFA) loss function to modify the attention of image patches so that organ patches attend only to other organ patches. Hence, no segmentation of 3D renal CT images is required at deployment time for malignancy prediction. The proposed framework achieved an AUC of 0.685 and an F1-score of 0.872 on a private dataset from the UF Integrated Data Repository (IDR), and an AUC of 0.760 and an F1-score of 0.852 on the publicly available KiTS21 dataset. These results surpass the performance of conventional models that rely on segmentation-based cropping for noise reduction, demonstrating the frameworks ability to enhance predictive accuracy without explicit segmentation input. The findings suggest that this approach offers a more efficient and reliable method for malignancy prediction, thereby enhancing clinical decision-making in renal cancer diagnosis."}

Through systematic analysis of artifacts in ViTs, we find that their fundamental mechanisms have yet to be sufficiently elucidated. In this paper, through systematic analysis, we conclude that these artifacts originate from a lazy aggregation behavior: ViT uses semantically irrelevant background patches as shortcuts to represent global semantics, driven by global attention and Coarse-grained semantic supervision. Our solution selectively integrates patch features into the CLS token, reducing the influence of background-dominated shortcuts and consistently improving performance across 12 benchmarks under label-, text-, and self-supervision.

They are widely used in zero-shot classification, multi-modal retrieval, text-to-image diffusion, and as image encoders in large vision-language models. However, CLIP's pretraining is dominated by images paired with short captions, biasing the model toward encoding simple descriptions of salient objects and leading to coarse alignment on complex scenes and dense descriptions. While recent work mitigates this by fine-tuning on small-scale long-caption datasets, we identify an important common bias: both human- and LLM-generated long captions typically begin with a one-sentence summary followed by a detailed description. We show that this acts as a shortcut during training, concentrating attention on the opening sentence and early tokens and weakening alignment over the rest of the caption. To resolve this, we introduce DeBias-CLIP, which removes the summary sentence during training and applies sentence sub-sampling and text token padding to distribute supervision across all token positions. DeBias-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art long-text retrieval, improves short-text retrieval, and is less sensitive to sentence order permutations. It is a drop-in replacement for Long-CLIP with no additional trainable parameters."}

In this work, we diagnose this issue by introducing the Visualized-Question (VQ) setting, where text queries are rendered directly onto images to structurally mandate visual engagement. Our diagnostic experiments on Qwen2.5-VL reveal a startling capability-utilization gap: despite possessing strong OCR capabilities, models suffer a performance degradation of up to 12.7% in the VQ setting, exposing a deep-seated ``modality laziness.'' To bridge this gap, we propose SimpleOCR, a plug-and-play training strategy that imposes a structural constraint on the learning process. By transforming training samples into the VQ format with randomized styles, SimpleOCR effectively invalidates text-based shortcuts, compelling the model to activate and optimize its visual text extraction pathways. Empirically, SimpleOCR yields robust gains without architectural modifications. On four representative OOD benchmarks, it surpasses the base model by 5.4% and GRPO based on original images by 2.7%, while exhibiting extreme data efficiency, achieving superior performance with 30x fewer samples (8.5K) than recent RL-based methods. Furthermore, its plug-and-play nature allows seamless integration with advanced RL strategies like NoisyRollout to yield complementary improvements.

We present MammoWise, a local multi-model pipeline that transforms open source VLMs into mammogram report generators and multi-task classifiers. MammoWise supports any Ollama-hosted VLM and mammography dataset, and enables zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting, with optional multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using a vector database for case-specific context. We evaluate MedGemma, LLaVA-Med, and Qwen2.5-VL on VinDr-Mammo and DMID datasets, assessing report quality (BERTScore, ROUGE-L), BI-RADS classification, breast density, and key findings. Report generation is consistently strong and improves with few-shot prompting and RAG. Classification is feasible but sensitive to model and dataset choice. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) of MedGemma improves reliability, achieving BI-RADS accuracy of 0.7545, density accuracy of 0.8840, and calcification accuracy of 0.9341 while preserving report quality.

We trace this failure to spatial credit collapse: activation credit concentrating on sparse visual patches in early transformer layers, which suppresses contextual evidence and increases reliance on language priors. We introduce Spatial Credit Redistribution (SCR), a training-free inference-time intervention that redistributes hidden-state activation from high-attention source patches to their context, guided by low-entropy inputs. We evaluate six model families (Chameleon, LLaVA, and Qwen, including both Qwen-VL and Qwen2-VL) at scales of 7B, 13B, and 30B, on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks. SCR reduces hallucination by ~4.7-6.0 percentage points on POPE-Adversarial, cuts CHAIR-s by 3.7-5.2 percentage points (42-51 percent relative), and CHAIR-i by 2.7-4.4 percentage points (44-58 percent relative), and preserves CIDEr within 0.8 percentage points. Gains are largest for low-entropy inputs, consistent with the theoretical framework. SCR incurs only 43-56 ms overhead (small models: +43-46 ms; large models: +54-56 ms), roughly 3-6 times lower than OPERA and VCD and 1.3-1.7 times lower than OVCD (+72 ms), while Pareto-dominating all three on both hallucination rate and CIDEr, making it practical for real-time settings. A controlled ablation confirms that attention-guided source selection is essential: replacing it with uniform random selection reduces hallucination rate gains from ~4.7-6.0 percentage points to only ~2.6-3.4 percentage points, pointing to credit-collapse as the key driver."}

Current methods aggregate high-definition (HD) maps and 3D bounding boxes as geometric conditions in diffusion models for conditional scene generation. However, implicit inter-condition dependency causes generation failures when control conditions change independently. Additionally, these methods suffer from insufficient details in both semantic and structural aspects. Specifically, brief and view-invariant captions restrict semantic contexts, resulting in weak background modeling. Meanwhile, the standard denoising loss with uniform spatial weighting neglects foreground structural details, causing visual distortions and blurriness. To address these challenges, we propose DrivePTS, which incorporates three key innovations. Firstly, our framework adopts a progressive learning strategy to mitigate inter-dependency between geometric conditions, reinforced by an explicit mutual information constraint. Secondly, a Vision-Language Model is utilized to generate multi-view hierarchical descriptions across six semantic aspects, providing fine-grained textual guidance. Thirdly, a frequency-guided structure loss is introduced to strengthen the model's sensitivity to high-frequency elements, improving foreground structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DrivePTS achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and controllability in generating diverse driving scenes. Notably, DrivePTS successfully generates rare scenes where prior methods fail, highlighting its strong generalization ability."}

From these refined depths, we generate a dense point cloud through back-projection and robust reprojection-error filtering, obtaining a clean and uniformly distributed geometric initialization for downstream reconstruction. This reliable dense geometry substantially accelerates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for mesh reconstruction, enabling high-quality surfaces with significantly fewer optimization iterations. For novel-view synthesis, SwiftNDC can also improve 3DGS rendering quality, highlighting the benefits of strong geometric initialization. We conduct a comprehensive study across five datasets, including two for mesh reconstruction, as well as three for novel-view synthesis.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework termed Quality-Aware Robust Multi-View Clustering (QARMVC). Specifically, QARMVC employs an information bottleneck mechanism to extract intrinsic semantics for view reconstruction. Leveraging the insight that noise disrupts semantic integrity and impedes reconstruction, we utilize the resulting reconstruction discrepancy to precisely quantify fine-grained contamination intensity and derive instance-level quality scores. These scores are integrated into a hierarchical learning strategy: at the feature level, a quality-weighted contrastive objective is designed to adaptively suppress the propagation of noise; at the fusion level, a high-quality global consensus is constructed via quality-weighted aggregation, which is subsequently utilized to align and rectify local views via mutual information maximization. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that QARMVC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous noise intensities."}

Recently, more diffusion guidance methods have emerged with improved generation quality and human preference. However, can these emerging diffusion guidance methods really achieve solid and significant improvements? In this paper, we rethink recent progress on diffusion guidance. Our work mainly consists of four contributions. First, we reveal a critical evaluation pitfall that common human preference models exhibit a strong bias towards large guidance scales. Simply increasing the CFG scale can easily improve quantitative evaluation scores due to strong semantic alignment, even if image quality is severely damaged (e.g., oversaturation and artifacts). Second, we introduce a novel guidance-aware evaluation (GA-Eval) framework that employs effective guidance scale calibration to enable fair comparison between current guidance methods and CFG by identifying the effects orthogonal and parallel to CFG effects. Third, motivated by the evaluation pitfall, we design Transcendent Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method that can significantly improve human preference scores in the conventional evaluation framework but actually does not work in practice. Fourth, in extensive experiments, we empirically evaluate recent eight diffusion guidance methods within the conventional evaluation framework and the proposed GA-Eval framework. Notably, simply increasing the CFG scales can compete with most studied diffusion guidance methods, while all methods suffer severely from winning rate degradation over standard CFG. Our work would strongly motivate the community to rethink the evaluation paradigm and future directions of this field."}

However, existing feed-forward methods still have potential for further performance gains, especially for out-of-domain data, and struggle to retain second-level inference time once a generative prior is introduced. These limitations stem from the one-shot prediction paradigm in existing feed-forward pipeline: models are strictly bounded by capacity, lack inference-time refinement, and are ill-suited for continuously injecting generative priors. We introduce GIFSplat, a purely feed-forward iterative refinement framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting from sparse unposed views. A small number of forward-only residual updates progressively refine current 3D scene using rendering evidence, achieve favorable balance between efficiency and quality. Furthermore, we distill a frozen diffusion prior into Gaussian-level cues from enhanced novel renderings without gradient backpropagation or ever-increasing view-set expansion, thereby enabling per-scene adaptation with generative prior while preserving feed-forward efficiency. Across DL3DV, RealEstate10K, and DTU, GIFSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines, improving PSNR by up to +2.1 dB, and it maintains second-scale inference time without requiring camera poses or any test-time gradient optimization."}

However, existing approaches either rely on full-sequence diffusion models with bidirectional generation, which limits temporal causality and real-time applicability, or autoregressive models that suffer from instability and cumulative errors. In this work, we present Causal Motion Diffusion Models (CMDM), a unified framework for autoregressive motion generation based on a causal diffusion transformer that operates in a semantically aligned latent space. CMDM builds upon a Motion-Language-Aligned Causal VAE (MAC-VAE), which encodes motion sequences into temporally causal latent representations. On top of this latent representation, an autoregressive diffusion transformer is trained using causal diffusion forcing to perform temporally ordered denoising across motion frames. To achieve fast inference, we introduce a frame-wise sampling schedule with causal uncertainty, where each subsequent frame is predicted from partially denoised previous frames. The resulting framework supports high-quality text-to-motion generation, streaming synthesis, and long-horizon motion generation at interactive rates. Experiments on HumanML3D and SnapMoGen demonstrate that CMDM outperforms existing diffusion and autoregressive models in both semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness, while substantially reducing inference latency."}

The latest version, YOLOv26, was recently released, while YOLOv12 achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 55.2 mAP on the COCO val2017 dataset. Meanwhile, transformer-based object detection models, also known as DEtection TRansformer (DETR), have demonstrated impressive performance.

However, despite their remarkable performance, all these models let information to slip away. They primarily focus on the features of foreground objects while neglecting the contextual information provided by the background.

BetterScene leverages the production-ready Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model pretrained on billions of frames as a strong backbone, aiming to mitigate artifacts and recover view-consistent details at inference time. Conventional methods have developed similar diffusion-based solutions to address these challenges of novel view synthesis. Despite significant improvements, these methods typically rely on off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion priors and fine-tune only the UNet module while keeping other components frozen, which still leads to inconsistent details and artifacts even when incorporating geometry-aware regularizations like depth or semantic conditions. To address this, we investigate the latent space of the diffusion model and introduce two components: (1) temporal equivariance regularization and (2) vision foundation model-aligned representation, both applied to the variational autoencoder (VAE) module within the SVD pipeline. BetterScene integrates a feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model to render features as inputs for the SVD enhancer and generate continuous, artifact-free, consistent novel views. We evaluate on the challenging DL3DV-10K dataset and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

The approach described here improves the existing perceptual quality of an image, which is primarily due to the technique's novel use of residual corrections. At the same time, we achieve the same level of trilinear interpolation complexity, using a significantly smaller number of network, residual corrections, and LUT parameters. The experimental results obtained from LoR-LUT, which is trained on the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, reproduce expert-level retouching characteristics with high perceptual fidelity and a sub-megabyte model size. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive visualization tool, termed LoR-LUT Viewer, which transforms an input image into the LUT-adjusted output image, via a number of slidebars that control different parameters. The tool provides an effective way to enhance interpretability and user confidence in the visual results. Overall, our proposed formulation offers a compact, interpretable, and efficient direction for future LUT-based image enhancement and style transfer."}

While operational satellite systems often lack full multi-spectral coverage, making RGB-only inference highly desirable for scalable deployment, the adoption of VLFMs for satellite imagery remains hindered by two factors: (1) multi-spectral inputs are informative but difficult to exploit consistently due to band redundancy and misalignment; and (2) CLIP-style text encoders limit semantic expressiveness and weaken fine-grained alignment. We present SATtxt, a spectrum-aware VLFM that operates with RGB inputs only at inference while retaining spectral cues learned during training. Our framework comprises two stages. First, Spectral Representation Distillation transfers spectral priors from a frozen multi-spectral teacher to an RGB student via a lightweight projector. Second, Spectrally Grounded Alignment with Instruction-Augmented LLMs bridges the distilled visual space and an expressive LLM embedding space. Across EuroSAT, BigEarthNet, and ForestNet, SATtxt improves zero-shot classification on average by 4.2%, retrieval by 5.9%, and linear probing by 2.7% over baselines, showing an efficient path toward spectrum-aware vision-language learning for Earth observation.

In contrast, our method is purely event-based, which relaxes restrictions for hardware implementation. We also introduce several advancements from the previous work that enable us to theoretically support and practically improve light field reconstruction from events alone. In particular, we clarify the key role of a black pattern in aperture coding patterns.

Prior work utilizes a chain of large language models, object segmentation models, and editing models for this task. However, the understanding models provide only a single modality ability, restricting the editing quality. We aim to bridge understanding and generation via a new multi-modality model that provides the intelligent abilities to instruction-based image editing models for more complex cases. To achieve this goal, we individually separate the instruction editing task with the multi-modality chain of thought prompts, i.e., Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning, editing region reasoning, and editing. For Chain-of-Thought planning, the large language model could reason the appropriate sub-prompts considering the instruction provided and the ability of the editing network. For editing region reasoning, we train an instruction-based editing region generation network with a multi-modal large language model. Finally, a hint-guided instruction-based editing network is proposed for editing image generations based on the sizeable text-to-image diffusion model to accept the hints for generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has competitive editing abilities on complex real-world images."}

Our observations suggest that this fragility stems from an imbalanced learning process, where the model develops an implicit preference for certain modalities, leading to the under-optimization of others. We propose a simple yet efficient method to address this challenge. The central insight of our work is that the dominance relationship between modalities can be effectively discerned and quantified in the frequency domain. To leverage this principle, we first introduce a Frequency Ratio Metric (FRM) to quantify modality preference by analyzing features in the frequency domain. Guided by FRM, we then propose a Multimodal Weight Allocation Module, a plug-and-play component that dynamically re-balances the contribution of each branch during training, promoting a more holistic learning paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MWAM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse architectural backbones, such as those based on CNNs and ViTs. Furthermore, MWAM delivers consistent performance gains across a wide range of tasks and modality combinations. This advancement extends beyond merely optimizing the performance of the base model; it also manifests as further performance improvements to state-of-the-art methods addressing the missing modality problem."}

Voxel-level annotation remains essential for developing and validating medical imaging algorithms, yet manual labeling is slow and expensive for 3D scans, and existing integrations frequently emphasize per-slice interaction without providing a unified, cohort-oriented workflow for navigation, propagation, interactive correction, and quantitative export in a single local pipeline.

Users can annotate cases sequentially under a single root folder with explicit proceed/skip actions, initialize objects via box-first prompting (including first/last-slice initialization for single-object propagation), refine predictions with point prompts, and finalize labels through prompt-first correction prior to saving. During export, per-object volumetry and 3D volume rendering are supported, and image geometry is preserved via SimpleITK.

Among acceleration strategies, caching-based methods offer a training-free and effective solution by reusing or predicting features across timesteps. However, existing approaches rely on fixed or locally adaptive schedules without considering the global structure of the denoising trajectory, often leading to error accumulation and visual artifacts. To overcome this limitation, we propose DPCache, a novel training-free acceleration framework that formulates diffusion sampling acceleration as a global path planning problem. DPCache constructs a Path-Aware Cost Tensor from a small calibration set to quantify the path-dependent error of skipping timesteps conditioned on the preceding key timestep. Leveraging this tensor, DPCache employs dynamic programming to select an optimal sequence of key timesteps that minimizes the total path cost while preserving trajectory fidelity. During inference, the model performs full computations only at these key timesteps, while intermediate outputs are efficiently predicted using cached features. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that DPCache achieves strong acceleration with minimal quality loss, outperforming prior acceleration methods by $+$0.031 ImageReward at 4.87$\\times$ speedup and even surpassing the full-step baseline by $+$0.028 ImageReward at 3.54$\\times$ speedup on FLUX, validating the effectiveness of our path-aware global scheduling framework.

To address these challenges, we adopt a geometry-only supervision paradigm that uses only binary occupancy labels (occupied vs free). Our framework builds upon 3D Language-Embedded Gaussians, which serve as a unified intermediate representation coupling fine-grained 3D geometry with a language-aligned semantic embedding. On the geometry side, we find that existing Gaussian-to-Occupancy operators fail to converge under such weak supervision, and we introduce an opacity-aware, Poisson-based approach that stabilizes volumetric aggregation. On the semantic side, direct alignment between rendered features and open-vocabulary segmentation features suffers from feature mixing; we therefore propose a Progressive Temperature Decay schedule that gradually sharpens opacities during splatting, strengthening Gaussian-language alignment. On Occ-ScanNet, our framework achieves 59.50 IoU and 21.05 mIoU in the open-vocabulary setting, surpassing all existing occupancy methods in IoU and outperforming prior open-vocabulary approaches by a large margin in mIoU.

However, existing approaches assume access to ground-truth captions. This assumption fails in realistic scenarios where only images are available and their textual annotations remain undisclosed, rendering prior methods ineffective when substituted with vision-language model (VLM) captions. In this work, we propose MoFit, a caption-free MIA framework that constructs synthetic conditioning inputs that are explicitly overfitted to the target model's generative manifold. Given a query image, MoFit proceeds in two stages: (i) model-fitted surrogate optimization, where a perturbation applied to the image is optimized to construct a surrogate in regions of the model's unconditional prior learned from member samples, and (ii) surrogate-driven embedding extraction, where a model-fitted embedding is derived from the surrogate and then used as a mismatched condition for the query image. This embedding amplifies conditional loss responses for member samples while leaving hold-outs relatively less affected, thereby enhancing separability in the absence of ground-truth captions.

However, their inherited position-dependent modeling mechanism, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), remains suboptimal for 3D multimodal understanding. The vanilla RoPE formulation fails to preserve essential three-dimensional spatial structures when encoding 3D tokens, and its relative distance computation overlooks angular dependencies, hindering the model's ability to capture directional variations in visual representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Spherical Coordinate-based Positional Embedding (SoPE). Our method maps point-cloud token indices into a 3D spherical coordinate space, enabling unified modeling of spatial locations and directional angles. This formulation preserves the inherent geometric structure of point-cloud data, enhances spatial awareness, and yields more consistent and expressive geometric representations for multimodal learning. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale frequency mixing strategy to fuse feature information across different frequency domains. Experimental results on multiple 3D scene benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, while real-world deployment experiments further demonstrate its strong generalization capability."}

Our key advance is a novel kinematics-aware metric that encodes skeletal topology. This metric allows the sampler to enforce hard constraints by distributing corrections coherently across the entire skeleton, avoiding the unnatural artifacts of naive projection. Furthermore, for sparse inputs, such as filling in long gaps between a few keyframes, we introduce a time-varying formulation using pseudo-observations that fade during sampling.

We propose TrajTok, an end-to-end video tokenizer module that is fully integrated and co-trained with video models for a downstream objective, dynamically adapting its token granularity to semantic complexity, independent of video duration. TrajTok contains a unified segmenter that performs implicit clustering over pixels in both space and time to directly produce object trajectories in a single forward pass. By prioritizing downstream adaptability over pixel-perfect segmentation fidelity, TrajTok is lightweight and efficient, yet empirically improves video understanding performance. With TrajTok, we implement a video CLIP model trained from scratch (TrajViT2). It achieves the best accuracy at scale across both classification and retrieval benchmarks, while maintaining efficiency comparable to the best token-merging methods. TrajTok also proves to be a versatile component beyond its role as a tokenizer.

While existing methods generate part-level 3D objects, they often fail to organize these parts into distinct instances in open-world scenes. Through a debiased clustering probe, we reveal a critical insight: this failure stems from the lack of structural constraints within the model's internal assignment mechanism. Based on this finding, we reframe the task of structured 3D scene generation as a global correlation assignment problem. To solve this, SceneTransporter formulates and solves an entropic Optimal Transport (OT) objective within the denoising loop of the compositional DiT model. This formulation imposes two powerful structural constraints. First, the resulting transport plan gates cross-attention to enforce an exclusive, one-to-one routing of image patches to part-level 3D latents, preventing entanglement. Second, the competitive nature of the transport encourages the grouping of similar patches, a process that is further regularized by an edge-based cost, to form coherent objects and prevent fragmentation.

To address these challenges, we propose Face Time Traveller (FaceTT), a diffusion-based framework that achieves high-fidelity, identity-consistent age transformation. Here, we introduce a Face-Attribute-Aware Prompt Refinement strategy that encodes intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (environmental) aging cues for context-aware conditioning. A tuning-free Angular Inversion method is proposed that efficiently maps real faces into the diffusion latent space for fast and accurate reconstruction. Moreover, an Adaptive Attention Control mechanism is introduced that dynamically balances cross-attention for semantic aging cues and self-attention for structural and identity preservation.

To address these challenges, we propose a robust VPS framework named CMSA-Net. The proposed network introduces a Causal Multi-scale Aggregation (CMA) module to effectively gather semantic information from multiple historical frames at different scales. By using causal attention, CMA ensures that temporal feature propagation follows strict time order, which helps reduce noise and improve feature reliability. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Multi-source Reference (DMR) strategy that adaptively selects informative and reliable reference frames based on semantic separability and prediction confidence. This strategy provides strong multi-frame guidance while keeping the model efficient for real-time inference.

Yet texture is still typically determined by slow and labour intensive laboratory particle size tests, while many sensing alternatives are either costly or too coarse to support routine field scale deployment. This paper proposes a robust and field deployable multispectral imaging (MSI) system and machine learning framework for predicting soil composition and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) texture classes. The proposed system uses a cost effective in-house MSI device operating from 365 nm to 940 nm to capture thirteen spectral bands, which effectively capture the spectral properties of soil texture. Regression models use the captured spectral properties to estimate clay, silt, and sand percentages, while a direct classifier predicts one of the twelve USDA textural classes. Indirect classification is obtained by mapping the regressed compositions to texture classes via the USDA soil texture triangle. The framework is evaluated on mixture data by mixing clay, silt, and sand in varying proportions, using the USDA classification triangle as a basis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a coefficient of determination R^2 up to 0.99 for composition prediction and over 99% accuracy for texture classification. These findings indicate that MSI combined with data-driven modeling can provide accurate, non-destructive, and field deployable soil texture characterization suitable for geotechnical screening and precision agriculture."}

Here we demonstrate that active, principled data curation during pretraining can serve as a viable, cost-effective alternative to brute-force dataset enlargement. We introduce CheXficient, a chest X-ray (CXR) foundation model that selectively prioritizes informative training samples.

To address this, we introduce SO3UFormer, a rotation-robust architecture designed to learn intrinsic spherical features that are less sensitive to the underlying coordinate frame. Our approach rests on three geometric pillars: (1) an intrinsic feature formulation that decouples the representation from the gravity vector by removing absolute latitude encoding; (2) quadrature-consistent spherical attention that accounts for non-uniform sampling densities; and (3) a gauge-aware relative positional mechanism that encodes local angular geometry using tangent-plane projected angles and discrete gauge pooling, avoiding reliance on global axes. We further use index-based spherical resampling together with a logit-level SO(3)-consistency regularizer during training. To rigorously benchmark robustness, we introduce Pose35, a dataset variant of Stanford2D3D perturbed by random rotations within $\\pm 35^\\circ$. Under the extreme test of arbitrary full SO(3) rotations, existing SOTAs fail catastrophically: the baseline SphereUFormer drops from 67.53 mIoU to 25.26 mIoU.

However, existing CDT frameworks remain limited to task-specific predictors rather than building a patient-specific, manipulable virtual heart. In this work, we introduce Chain of Flow (COF), a foundational ECG-driven generative framework that reconstructs full 4D cardiac structure and motion from a single cardiac cycle. The method integrates cine-CMR and 12-lead ECG during training to learn a unified representation of cardiac geometry, electrophysiology, and motion dynamics. We evaluate Chain of Flow on diverse cohorts and demonstrate accurate recovery of cardiac anatomy, chamber-wise function, and dynamic motion patterns. The reconstructed 4D hearts further support downstream CDT tasks such as volumetry, regional function analysis, and virtual cine synthesis. By enabling full 4D organ reconstruction directly from ECG, COF transforms cardiac digital twins from narrow predictive models into fully generative, patient-specific virtual hearts. Code will be released after review."}

While photorealistic simulators offer a solution, they often struggle with the ``sim-to-real\" gap; conversely, simple image-masking techniques lack the spatio-temporal coherence required to obtain augmented single- and multi-frame scenes with the correct appearance and dimensions. This paper introduces a multi-modal augmented reality framework designed to bridge this gap by integrating photorealistic virtual objects into real-world railway sequences from the OSDaR23 dataset. Utilizing Unreal Engine 5 features, our pipeline leverages LiDAR point-clouds and INS/GNSS data to ensure accurate object placement and temporal stability across RGB frames. This paper also proposes a segmentation-based refinement strategy for INS/GNSS data to significantly improve the realism of the augmented sequences, as confirmed by the comparative study presented in the paper. Carefully designed augmented sequences are collected to produce OSDaR-AR, a public dataset designed to support the development of next-generation railway perception systems.

Automatic fingerspelling recognition plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities, yet it remains challenging due to the signing-hand ambiguity issue, the lack of appropriate training losses, and the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Prior fingerspelling recognition methods rely on explicit signing-hand detection, which often leads to recognition failures, and on a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss, which exhibits the peaky behavior problem. To address these issues, we develop OpenFS, an open-source approach for fingerspelling recognition and synthesis. We propose a multi-hand-capable fingerspelling recognizer that supports both single- and multi-hand inputs and performs implicit signing-hand detection by incorporating a dual-level positional encoding and a signing-hand focus (SF) loss. The SF loss encourages cross-attention to focus on the signing hand, enabling implicit signing-hand detection during recognition. Furthermore, without relying on the CTC loss, we introduce a monotonic alignment (MA) loss that enforces the output letter sequence to follow the temporal order of the input pose sequence through cross-attention regularization. In addition, we propose a frame-wise letter-conditioned generator that synthesizes realistic fingerspelling pose sequences for OOV words. This generator enables the construction of a new synthetic benchmark, called FSNeo. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in recognition and validate the effectiveness of the proposed recognizer and generator.

We benchmark representative agents on two imaging-only proxy diagnostic tasks, (1) melanoma vs. atypical nevus and (2) pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia, where visual features are highly confounded despite substantial differences in clinical management.

Firstly, in order to improve the feature representation of ResNet-50 on small objects, we presented a novel Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention (SLPA) module, which is integrated after each stage of ResNet-50 to identify and emphasize important local regions. Secondly, to enhance the model's semantic understanding and features representation, we designed a Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement Module (MSFEM), which is incorporated into the lateral connections of C5 layer for building Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). Finally, the features representation quality of traditional feature pyramid network will be affected because the features are not aligned when the upper and lower layers are fused. In order to handle it, we utilized deformable convolutions to align the features in the fusion processing of the upper and lower levels of the Feature Pyramid Network, which can help enhance the model's ability to detect and recognize small objects. The extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets: VisDrone and DOTA demonstrate that our improved model performs better for small object detection in aerial images compared to the original algorithm."}

To fit this representation from multi-view videos, we propose PackUV-GS, a temporally consistent fitting method that directly optimizes Gaussian parameters in the UV domain. A flow-guided Gaussian labeling and video keyframing module identifies dynamic Gaussians, stabilizes static regions, and preserves temporal coherence even under large motions and disocclusions.

We recognize that 4D datasets are far scarcer than 3D ones, which hampers the scalability of self-supervised 4D models. A promising alternative is to transfer 3D pre-trained models to 4D perception tasks. However, rigorous empirical analysis reveals two critical limitations that impede transfer capability: overfitting and the modality gap. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel \"Align then Adapt\" (PointATA) paradigm that decomposes parameter-efficient transfer learning into two sequential stages. Optimal-transport theory is employed to quantify the distributional discrepancy between 3D and 4D datasets, enabling our proposed point align embedder to be trained in Stage 1 to alleviate the underlying modality gap. To mitigate overfitting, an efficient point-video adapter and a spatial-context encoder are integrated into the frozen 3D backbone to enhance temporal modeling capacity in Stage 2. Notably, with the above engineering-oriented designs, PointATA enables a pre-trained 3D model without temporal knowledge to reason about dynamic video content at a smaller parameter cost compared to previous work. Extensive experiments show that PointATA can match or even outperform strong full fine-tuning models, whilst enjoying the advantage of parameter efficiency, e.g. 97.21 \\% accuracy on 3D action recognition, $+8.7 \\%$ on 4 D action segmentation, and 84.06\\% on 4D semantic segmentation."}

Such workflows often require coupling vision to language to provide a natural-language interface. However, paired image-text data needed to learn this coupling are scarce and difficult to obtain in many research and clinical settings. One such setting is microscopic analysis of cell-body-stained histological human brain sections, which enables the study of cytoarchitecture: cell density and morphology and their laminar and areal organization. Here, we propose a label-mediated method that generates meaningful captions from images by linking images and text only through a label, without requiring curated paired image-text data. Given the label, we automatically mine area descriptions from related literature and use them as synthetic captions reflecting canonical cytoarchitectonic attributes. An existing cytoarchitectonic vision foundation model (CytoNet) is then coupled to a large language model via an image-to-text training objective, enabling microscopy regions to be described in natural language. Across 57 brain areas, the resulting method produces plausible area-level descriptions and supports open-set use through explicit rejection of unseen areas. It matches the cytoarchitectonic reference label for in-scope patches with 90.6% accuracy and, with the area label masked, its descriptions remain discriminative enough to recover the area in an 8-way test with 68.6% accuracy. These results suggest that weak, label-mediated pairing can suffice to connect existing biomedical vision foundation models to language, providing a practical recipe for integrating natural-language in domains where fine-grained paired annotations are scarce."}

Conventional histograms or globally-decayed time-surface representations apply fixed temporal parameters across the entire image plane, which in practice creates a trade-off between preserving spatial structure during still periods and retaining sharp edges during rapid motion. We introduce Locally Adaptive Decay Surfaces (LADS), a family of event representations in which the temporal decay at each location is modulated according to local signal dynamics. Three strategies are explored, based on event rate, Laplacian-of-Gaussian response, and high-frequency spectral energy. These adaptive schemes preserve detail in quiescent regions while reducing blur in regions of dense activity. Extensive experiments on the public data show that LADS consistently improves both face detection and facial landmark accuracy compared to standard non-adaptive representations. At 30 Hz, LADS achieves higher detection accuracy and lower landmark error than either baseline, and at 240 Hz it mitigates the accuracy decline typically observed at higher frequencies, sustaining 2.44 % normalized mean error for landmarks and 0.966 mAP50 in face detection. These high-frequency results even surpass the accuracy reported in prior works operating at 30 Hz, setting new benchmarks for event-based face analysis. Moreover, by preserving spatial structure at the representation stage, LADS supports the use of much lighter network architectures while still retaining real-time performance. These results highlight the importance of context-aware temporal integration for neuromorphic vision and point toward real-time, high-frequency human-computer interaction systems that exploit the unique advantages of event cameras."}

To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalization of the Hough transform on the unit sphere (S(2)) to estimate the camera's heading. First, the method extracts correspondences between two frames and generates a great circle of directions compatible with each pair of correspondences. Then, by discretizing the unit sphere using a Fibonacci lattice as bin centers, each great circle casts votes for a range of directions, ensuring that features unaffected by noise or dynamic objects vote consistently for the correct motion direction. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus efficiency.

Even the best model in our evaluation, Gemini-3-Pro with tools, achieves only 27.3% overall accuracy, and hard instances can require more than 25 tool-calling turns. We expect AgentVista to accelerate the development of more capable and reliable multimodal agents for realistic and ultra-challenging problem solving."}

To tackle the challenge, this work is motivated by the intuition that multisource degraded feature distributions are induced by different degradation-specific shifts from an underlying degradation-agnostic distribution, and recovering such a shared distribution is thus crucial for achieving generalization across degradations. With this insight, we propose BaryIR, a representation learning framework that aligns multisource degraded features in the Wasserstein barycenter (WB) space, which models a degradation-agnostic distribution by minimizing the average of Wasserstein distances to multisource degraded distributions. We further introduce residual subspaces, whose embeddings are mutually contrasted while remaining orthogonal to the WB embeddings. Consequently, BaryIR explicitly decouples two orthogonal spaces: a WB space that encodes the degradation-agnostic invariant contents shared across degradations, and residual subspaces that adaptively preserve the degradation-specific knowledge. This disentanglement mitigates overfitting to in-distribution degradations and enables adaptive restoration grounded on the degradation-agnostic shared invariance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR performs competitively against state-of-the-art all-in-one methods. Notably, BaryIR generalizes well to unseen degradations (\\textit{e.g.,} types and levels) and shows remarkable robustness in learning generalized features, even when trained on limited degradation types and evaluated on real-world data with mixed degradations."}

Most existing tracking-by-detection approaches assume static cameras or ignore physical consistency in motion modeling, leading to unreliable counting under dynamic conditions. We propose a physics-constrained tracking framework that unifies detection, appearance, and 3D motion reasoning in a real-time pipeline. Our approach integrates a transfer-learned YOLOv11m detector with EfficientNet-B0 appearance encoding within DeepSORT, while introducing a physics-constrained Kalman model (Phys-3D) that enforces physically plausible 3D motion dynamics through pinhole geometry. To address counting brittleness under occlusions, we implement a virtual counting band with persistence. On our platform benchmark, MOT-RailwayPlatformCrowdHead Dataset(MOT-RPCH), our method reduces counting error to 2.97%, demonstrating robust performance despite motion and occlusions.

To address this, we propose EmbodMocap, a portable and affordable data collection pipeline using two moving iPhones. Our key idea is to jointly calibrate dual RGB-D sequences to reconstruct both humans and scenes within a unified metric world coordinate frame. The proposed method allows metric-scale and scene-consistent capture in everyday environments without static cameras or markers, bridging human motion and scene geometry seamlessly.

However, we identify a critical flaw in prevailing PnP solvers (e.g., based on HQS or Proximal Gradient): they function as memoryless operators, updating estimates solely based on instantaneous gradients. This lack of historical tracking inevitably leads to non-vanishing steady-state bias, where the reconstruction fails to strictly satisfy physical measurements under heavy corruption. To resolve this, we propose Dual-Coupled PnP Diffusion, which restores the classical dual variable to provide integral feedback, theoretically guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the exact data manifold. However, this rigorous geometric coupling introduces a secondary challenge: the accumulated dual residuals exhibit spectrally colored, structured artifacts that violate the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) assumption of diffusion priors, causing severe hallucinations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spectral Homogenization (SH), a frequency-domain adaptation mechanism that modulates these structured residuals into statistically compliant pseudo-AWGN inputs. This effectively aligns the solver's rigorous optimization trajectory with the denoiser's valid statistical manifold. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our approach resolves the bias-hallucination trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity with significantly accelerated convergence."}

GE-MLPs lift this constraint by operating with tensor-valued parameters, enabling explicit control over which dimensions are preserved or contracted without information loss. Through rigorous mathematical derivations, we demonstrate that classification, segmentation, and detection are special cases of MTL, differing only in their dimensional configuration within a formally defined task space. We further prove that this task space is strictly larger than what matrix-based formulations can natively express, enabling principled task configurations such as spatiotemporal or cross modal predictions that require destructive flattening under conventional approaches. This work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing computer vision tasks through the lens of tensor algebra."}

By combining global contextual reasoning with camera-aware feature representations, UniScale is able to recover the metric-scale of the scene.

Automatic synopsis generation for long-form videos, such as movies and TV series, presents a significant challenge for existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs).

To overcome these limitations, we propose MovieTeller, a novel framework for generating movie synopses via tool-augmented progressive abstraction. Our core contribution is a training-free, tool-augmented, fact-grounded generation process. Instead of requiring costly model fine-tuning, our framework directly leverages off-the-shelf models in a plug-and-play manner. We first invoke a specialized face recognition model as an external \"tool\" to establish Factual Groundings--precise character identities and their corresponding bounding boxes. These groundings are then injected into the prompt to steer the VLM's reasoning, ensuring the generated scene descriptions are anchored to verifiable facts. Furthermore, our progressive abstraction pipeline decomposes the summarization of a full-length movie into a multi-stage process, effectively mitigating the context length limitations of current VLMs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements in factual accuracy, character consistency, and overall narrative coherence compared to end-to-end baselines."}

We benchmark state-of-the-art LMMs on diverse datasets for closed-world classification and find that, although their zero-shot performance is lower than CLIP's, LMMs with a few in-context examples can match or even surpass contrastive VLMs with cache-based adapters, their \"in-context\" equivalent. We extend this analysis to the open-world setting, where the generative nature of LMMs makes them more suitable for the task. In this challenging scenario, LMMs struggle whenever provided with imperfect context information. To address this issue, we propose CIRCLE, a simple training-free method that assigns pseudo-labels to in-context examples, iteratively refining them with the available context itself. Through extensive experiments, we show that CIRCLE establishes a robust baseline for open-world classification, surpassing VLM counterparts and highlighting the potential of LMMs to serve as unified classifiers, and a flexible alternative to specialized models."}

Currently, IL-based methods have become a mainstream paradigm: models rely on standard driving behaviors given by experts, and learn to minimize the discrepancy between their actions and expert actions. However, this objective of \"only driving like the expert\" suffers from limited generalization: when encountering rare or unseen long-tail scenarios outside the distribution of expert demonstrations, models tend to produce unsafe decisions in the absence of prior experience. This raises a fundamental question: Can an E2E-AD system make reliable decisions without any expert action supervision? Motivated by this, we propose a unified framework named Risk-aware World Model Predictive Control (RaWMPC) to address this generalization dilemma through robust control, without reliance on expert demonstrations. Practically, RaWMPC leverages a world model to predict the consequences of multiple candidate actions and selects low-risk actions through explicit risk evaluation. To endow the world model with the ability to predict the outcomes of risky driving behaviors, we design a risk-aware interaction strategy that systematically exposes the world model to hazardous behaviors, making catastrophic outcomes predictable and thus avoidable. Furthermore, to generate low-risk candidate actions at test time, we introduce a self-evaluation distillation method to distill riskavoidance capabilities from the well-trained world model into a generative action proposal network without any expert demonstration. Extensive experiments show that RaWMPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while providing superior decision interpretability."}

While differential privacy (DP) provides a principled framework for such guarantees, standard DP finetuning (e.g., with DP-SGD) often results in severe degradation of image quality, particularly in high-frequency textures, due to the indiscriminate addition of noise across all model parameters. In this work, we propose a spectral DP framework based on the hypothesis that the most privacy-sensitive portions of an image are often low-frequency components in the wavelet space (e.g., facial features and object shapes) while high-frequency components are largely generic and public. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the following two-stage framework for DP image generation with coarse image intermediaries: (1) DP finetune an autoregressive spectral image tokenizer model on the low-resolution wavelet coefficients of the sensitive images, and (2) perform high-resolution upsampling using a publicly pretrained super-resolution model. By restricting the privacy budget to the global structures of the image in the first stage, and leveraging the post-processing property of DP for detail refinement, we achieve promising trade-offs between privacy and utility.

To better learn structural link representation, we transform the original graph into its corresponding line graph and apply a Graph Transformer on it for connectedness prediction. This formulation overcomes the limitations of endpoint-embedding fusion on set-isomorphic links, enabling rich link representations and effective relational reasoning over the global structure.

However, existing research on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG), given a textual query, mainly focuses on localizing targets in short videos of tens of seconds, typically less than one minute, which limits real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Long-Form STVG (LF-STVG), which aims to locate targets in long-term videos. Compared with short videos, long-term videos contain much longer temporal spans and more irrelevant information, making it difficult for existing STVG methods that process all frames at once. To address this challenge, we propose an AutoRegressive Transformer architecture for LF-STVG, termed ART-STVG. Unlike conventional STVG methods that require the entire video sequence to make predictions at once, ART-STVG treats the video as streaming input and processes frames sequentially, enabling efficient handling of long videos. To model spatio-temporal context, we design spatial and temporal memory banks and apply them to the decoders. Since memories from different moments are not always relevant to the current frame, we introduce simple yet effective memory selection strategies to provide more relevant information to the decoders, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, instead of parallel spatial and temporal localization, we propose a cascaded spatio-temporal design that connects the spatial decoder to the temporal decoder, allowing fine-grained spatial cues to assist complex temporal localization in long videos. Experiments on newly extended LF-STVG datasets show that ART-STVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while achieving competitive performance on conventional short-form STVG."}

Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact datasets that preserve the knowledge of large-scale training sets while drastically reducing storage and computation. Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled training-free distillation by leveraging pre-trained generative priors; however, existing guidance strategies remain limited. Current score-based methods either perform unguided denoising or rely on simple mode-based guidance toward instance prototype centroids (IPC centroids), which often are rudimentary and suboptimal. We propose Manifold-Guided Distillation (ManifoldGD), a training-free diffusion-based framework that integrates manifold consistent guidance at every denoising timestep. Our method employs IPCs computed via a hierarchical, divisive clustering of VAE latent features, yielding a multi-scale coreset of IPCs that captures both coarse semantic modes and fine intra-class variability. Using a local neighborhood of the extracted IPC centroids, we create the latent manifold for each diffusion denoising timestep. At each denoising step, we project the mode-alignment vector onto the local tangent space of the estimated latent manifold, thus constraining the generation trajectory to remain manifold-faithful while preserving semantic consistency. This formulation improves representativeness, diversity, and image fidelity without requiring any model retraining. Empirical results demonstrate consistent gains over existing training-free and training-based baselines in terms of FID, l2 distance among real and synthetic dataset embeddings, and classification accuracy, establishing ManifoldGD as the first geometry-aware training-free data distillation framework."}

However, existing methods often treat metadata as isolated tags, failing to exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in clinical descriptions. We propose PRIMA (Pre-training with Risk-integrated Image-Metadata Alignment), a framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge into multi-modal representation learning. We first curate an expert corpus of risk-disease correlations via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to refine Clinical ModernBERT, embedding diagnostic priors into the text encoder. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a dual-encoder pre-training strategy utilizing DINOv3 and our refined BERT, optimized by a suite of four complementary loss functions. These losses are designed to capture multi-granular semantic alignment and handle the ambiguity of clinical correlations through soft labels. Finally, we leverage Qwen-3 to fuse these aligned features for precise disease classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRIMA effectively harmonizes pixel-level features with abstract clinical expertise, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework achieves superior robustness without the need for massive data collection or exhaustive computational resources. Our code will be made public upon acceptance."}

While existing omni-modal large language models (OLLM) excel at perceiving diverse modalities, they lack the complex reasoning abilities of recent large reasoning models (LRM). However, enhancing the reasoning ability of OLLMs through additional training presents significant challenges, including the need for high-quality data, task-specific adaptation, and substantial computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ThinkOmni, a training-free and data-free framework that lifts textual reasoning to omni-modal scenarios. ThinkOmni introduces two key components: 1) LRM-as-a-Guide, which leverages off-the-shelf LRMs to guide the OLLM decoding process; 2) Stepwise Contrastive Scaling, which adaptively balances perception and reasoning signals without manual hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on six multi-modal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkOmni consistently delivers performance improvements, with main results achieving 70.2 on MathVista and 75.5 on MMAU. Overall, ThinkOmni offers a flexible and generalizable solution for omni-modal reasoning and provides new insights into the generalization and application of reasoning capabilities."}

Despite recent progress, OVS lags behind fully supervised approaches due to two challenges: the coarse image-level supervision used to train VLMs and the semantic ambiguity of natural language. We address these limitations by introducing a few-shot setting that augments textual prompts with a support set of pixel-annotated images. Building on this, we propose a retrieval-augmented test-time adapter that learns a lightweight, per-image classifier by fusing textual and visual support features. Unlike prior methods relying on late, hand-crafted fusion, our approach performs learned, per-query fusion, achieving stronger synergy between modalities. The method supports continually expanding support sets, and applies to fine-grained tasks such as personalized segmentation. Experiments show that we significantly narrow the gap between zero-shot and supervised segmentation while preserving open-vocabulary ability."}

However, because of the novelty in the nature of their output signals, there is a gap in the variability of available data and a lack of extensive analysis of the parameters characterizing their signals. This paper addresses these issues by providing readers with an in-depth understanding of how intrinsic parameters affect the performance of a model trained on event data, specifically for object detection. We also use our findings to expand the capabilities of the downstream model towards sensor-agnostic robustness."}

Accepted at CVPR 2026", "summary": "We identify occlusion reasoning as a fundamental yet overlooked aspect for 3D layout-conditioned generation. It is essential for synthesizing partially occluded objects with depth-consistent geometry and scale. While existing methods can generate realistic scenes that follow input layouts, they often fail to model precise inter-object occlusions. We propose SeeThrough3D, a model for 3D layout conditioned generation that explicitly models occlusions. We introduce an occlusion-aware 3D scene representation (OSCR), where objects are depicted as translucent 3D boxes placed within a virtual environment and rendered from desired camera viewpoint. The transparency encodes hidden object regions, enabling the model to reason about occlusions, while the rendered viewpoint provides explicit camera control during generation. We condition a pretrained flow based text-to-image image generation model by introducing a set of visual tokens derived from our rendered 3D representation. Furthermore, we apply masked self-attention to accurately bind each object bounding box to its corresponding textual description, enabling accurate generation of multiple objects without object attribute mixing. To train the model, we construct a synthetic dataset with diverse multi-object scenes with strong inter-object occlusions. SeeThrough3D generalizes effectively to unseen object categories and enables precise 3D layout control with realistic occlusions and consistent camera control."}

Our approach is built on the key insight that this bottleneck stems from the varying-length Key-Value (KV) space representation of scene geometry, which we distill into a fixed-size Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) via test-time training. VGG-T$^3$ (Visual Geometry Grounded Test Time Training) scales linearly w.r.t. the number of input views, similar to online models, and reconstructs a $1k$ image collection in just $54$ seconds, achieving a $11.6\\times$ speed-up over baselines that rely on softmax attention. Since our method retains global scene aggregation capability, our point map reconstruction error outperforming other linear-time methods by large margins.

MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce interpretable reasoning and modality recognition. This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short. To measure progress, we propose a unified evaluation framework for both text-only and image+text tasks that uses a Reference-based LLM-as-judge in place of brittle string-overlap metrics, capturing semantic correctness, reasoning, and contextual alignment. Despite using only $\\sim51$K instruction examples, MediX-R1 achieves excellent results across standard medical LLM (text-only) and VLM (image + text) benchmarks, outperforming strong open-source baselines and delivering particularly large gains on open-ended clinical tasks. Our results demonstrate that open-ended RL with comprehensive reward signals and LLM-based evaluation is a practical path toward reliable medical reasoning in multimodal models.

Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data\nvisualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.\nAre VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the\ndata visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the\nvision and language modules, or how information is processed within the\nlanguage module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding\ntasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,\nextracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other\nsummary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To\ndiagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation\npatching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a\nvariety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the\ncoordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often\nlead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the\ncorrect coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when\nthe model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be\nsuccessfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,\nsuggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.\nWe further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks\ninvolving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens\nperformance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across\nmany data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling\nperformance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs\nthat might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization\nunderstanding."}

The intuition is that the noise\nprediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and\nnon-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we\nsuppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around\na certain time step of the diffusion process.

Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two\ncritical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated\nvideo-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a\nsignificant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal\nalignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting\nCLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention.

Prior work\nprimarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather\nthan visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by\namplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.\nHowever, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where\nattention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and\nneglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without\nadjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect\nareas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided\nCross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual\nsaliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or \"gaze\nshifts\", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify\nattention to both salient visual information and the user query at each\ndecoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant\ntokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for\nwell-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT\neffectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and\nclassification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,\nwhile maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational\noverhead."}

The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images\nare first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,\ndistributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent\nsymmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a\nself-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input\nwavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second\nstage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the\ninput wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns\nthe underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss\nfunction is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need\nfor ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for\noptimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is\nincorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the\nmagnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember\ncoefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps\nduring inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract\nendmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with\ndifferent signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark\nhyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several\nstate-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,\nquantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a\nresilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact\nnetwork parameters for practical applications."}

To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep\nlearning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention\nmechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention\nnetwork (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This\ndesign facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of\nthe global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across\ndifferent types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used\ndata augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local\nfeatures in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a\ntransformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to\npinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.\nTests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed\nthat ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,\nreliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of\n0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant\nimprovement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by\n4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with\na standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial\nintelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to\nconsistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the\ndecision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU\nclassification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical\nimage analysis."}

Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial\nfine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot\nsettings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP\nadversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view\nvariations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective\ntest-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic\nconsistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and\nmulti-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the\ntarget embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning\nperturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under\nadversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play\ninference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack\nsettings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP\nwhile maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs\nfor further gains.

We argue that when\nboth constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares\n(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large\nextent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction\nterm introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary.

Furthermore, this\ninterpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by\nreinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure\ntensor.

The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is\nfundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper\ninvestigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing\nanomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing\nthe embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse\n2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs\ncan act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video\ninto text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate\nfour open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and\nprivacy-preserving conditions.

To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality\nand challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack\nconsists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term\nand 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-\nand long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in\nunconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but\nmore realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,\neach video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round\nmeticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of\nPlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is\ndifferent from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by\nfar the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar\ntracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to\nprovide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar\ntrackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis.

In contrast to existing methods that either focus on\npre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex\ntechniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that\ncontext-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from\ncross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly\napplying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the\ncase where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used\nindividually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality\nand efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,\nno auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region\nspecifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA\nactivation words for seamless integration into standard workflows.

One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate\ntemporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional\nkeyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address\nthis, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future\ntimesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This\ntransforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model\ncontinuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio\ncues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also\nenables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead\ntarget, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the\ntemporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity\nand consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while\nsmaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human\nanimation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,\nidentity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal\nconditioning across several different architectures.

However, naively\napplying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We\nargue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are\nasked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not\nreally see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for\nsemantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,\nleaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable\nperceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited\nvisual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically\nuses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,\nheterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful\nvisual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting\nin catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue\ncapabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before\nreasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive\nartifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that\nsubsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose\nForensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for\nmulti-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection.

Few-shot learning\nmethods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled\nexamples.

However, medical\napplications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require\nlearning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously\nknown ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot\nclassification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been\nscarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a\nlarge-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public\ndatabases.

To bridge the gap between\nthe prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user\nneeds for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized\nhigh-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification.

However, progress in this area is currently\nhindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on\ncostly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object\ninteraction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of\nthe actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about\nmanipulated objects (e.g., \"I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to\nthe pan\"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to\nacquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We\nintroduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel\ntask where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from\nnatural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference\ntime. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised\nIn-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model\ndistilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object\nassociations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at\ntest time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on\nopen-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the\nsuperiority of its design.

Under Review", "summary": "Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,\nwith patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon\nmodeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch\nconstruction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture\ntemporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This\nnaive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens\nrepresentation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided\nDynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically\ndetects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch\nboundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational\nbenefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an\nEntropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria\nto locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an\nAdaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to\ncapture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.\nThese embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model\ninter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks\ndemonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing\nentropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series\nmodeling.

This becomes problematic when the applied blur is\nundesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose\nDiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image\nconditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we\ndesign a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the\ntraining requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in\nthe same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we\ndevelop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with\nvarying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that\ntraining with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF\nbehaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger\nconstraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos\nof different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we\npropose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF\nmanipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically\ngrounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully\naligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be\ncombined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to\nevaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of\nscenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography\nand generative AI applications."}

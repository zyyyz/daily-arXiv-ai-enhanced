While deep learning has\nrevolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a\ncritical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively\nexpensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert\nsurveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental\nquestion: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without\nreal-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing\ntwo paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam\necho-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar\nsimulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art\nneural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that\nleverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry\nsurveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks\ntrained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated\nscenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.\nConversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data\nwithout requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic\nnoise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom\nabout data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work\nopens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine\narchaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments\nwhere traditional machine learning approaches fail."}

The majority of\ncurrent approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or\nlearned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering\nstrategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually\ndesigned features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better\nthan the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based\napproaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not\ntruly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second\nis that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,\nleading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric\ncharacteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network\ntraining. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,\nnamed RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds\nin a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer\nencoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance\nmasks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries.

Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably\nreuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each\nvertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long\ntoken sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose\nan efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and\nfaces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an\nautoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count\nto approximately 23\\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.\nNext, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single\nstep by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency\nmatrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,\nwe introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural\narrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge\nconnections.

However, progressively manipulating certain\nattributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains\nchallenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.\nSome studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.\nHowever, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is\ntrained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new\nattribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy\naccumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical\napplications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this\nissue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes\nthe text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute\ndirections. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling\ninterpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.\nMoreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports\nzero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and\nthe composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving\nnotable improvements compared to previous methods.

Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like\naudio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or\ncontext. To bridge this gap, \\textbf{we propose a framework designed to\ngenerate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also\nsemantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \\textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is\nbuilt upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions\nthat provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion\ngenerator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production\nof actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure\nthe effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality\nconflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel\nPseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to\naccurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby\ngenerating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and\nlinguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves\nleading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync\naccuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with\ntextual prompts.

Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then\nreconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving\nunedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative\nmodels, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs\nprecise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer\nfirst predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and\nkey-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing\nphase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the\ncorresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these\ncontextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of\npreserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the\nconsistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a\nhuman-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully\nlabeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of\npreserved regions and overall quality.

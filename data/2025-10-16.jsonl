To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first\nmethod capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in\nreal-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera\nmodels, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary\nspinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor\ninconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and\nanchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%\ncompared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing\napproaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles\na wider range of camera models).

However,\ntime-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While\nrecent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,\nthese models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario\ndata, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from\ndifferent geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment\noften struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological\nconditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising\nperformance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization\nTest-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess\nintrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,\nwhich remain consistent across different regions regardless of external\nconditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for\nguiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust\nparameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance\nin new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.\nSpecifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic\ncharacteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the\nmodel during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to\nadapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses\nderived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order\nvariation.

However, the existing\ncounting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded\nsystems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex\ncalculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the\nmodel to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering\nthe aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a\nstem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the\nfastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution\nkernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which\neffectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we\nuse conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge\nmulti-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial\nto the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid\nnetworks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion\nproblems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for\nsuper real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive\naccuracy.

Moreover,\nto address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated\npipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,\nresulting in a new \\textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE\nBench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA\npairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals\nthat, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,\nespecially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a\nrobust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research\ntoward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be\npublicly released."}

To tackle these\nissues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages\nDomain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.\nThe CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight\nSpatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation\n(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)\nloss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the\nneighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight\nconvolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution\ndiscrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation\nmodules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter\ncaptures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the\nmutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain\nseparation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which\nensures high inference efficiency.

For several\nanalyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral\nanalysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis\nwith PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual\ninformation are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a\n2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to\nperforming spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning\na spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,\nPLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean\ncontent of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.\nModeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is\nlimited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.\nTherefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat\ncontent in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and\npixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\\%.

Addressing these challenges requires robust\npreprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with\ndeep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This\nsystematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the\nkey challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image\nenhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review\nprovides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across\ndifferent imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in\nassessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified\nas the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most\nattention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and\nbone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize\nconventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1\nexplores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies\nemploy both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on\nreference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a\ntotal of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based.

Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition\nconstrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation\nprovides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level\nabstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We\ncurated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely\nannotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for\nspatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data.

This\nchallenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private\nand may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party\nverification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later\nverification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and\nrely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and\nnon-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight\nwatermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the\ndiffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation\nprocess. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is\nhighly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash\nfunction into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a\nvalid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an\nalternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the\nrobustness of our method under various manipulations.

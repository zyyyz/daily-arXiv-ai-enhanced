While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer\naccuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in\nreal-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and\nscalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small\nor occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object\ndetection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces\ntwo key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which\nintegrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance\nfeature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which\ncaptures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial\nlocalization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile\nphones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a\nprecision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of\n55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further\nvalidate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both\nsensitivity and localization accuracy.

However, the\nperformance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.\nAlthough some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training\nthem with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from\nthe original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based\ninformation processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like\nEncoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational\nprinciples and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced\nby the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data\nto carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete\nvisual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron\nmodel demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively\nincreases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN\nperformance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles.

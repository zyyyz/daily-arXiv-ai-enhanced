The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF\ndepth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric\ncalibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between\nmodalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract\ncomplementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by\nmonocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform\ndepth super-resolution.

A\npandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was\nnot prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people\nworldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the\nrespiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia.

However, existing\nmethods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,\nleading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational\nresources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation\n(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing\ngeneration efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely\nexisting parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable\nconditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert\n(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and\nassigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and\nconditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features\nunder different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement\nand redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge\nthe information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose\nWeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective\ninteraction between global text-level control from the backbone and\nfine-grained control from conditional branches.

We show that using only\ngeneral-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able\nto achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical\nmulti-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel\nanalysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved\nimages each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these\ncases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval\nmodels. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these\nchallenging cases over standard RAG.

For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT\nimages, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',\nand 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data\nrefers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut\nthrough the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were\nrearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance\nwas assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index\nmeasure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices\nresults in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input\ndata dimensions."}

Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,\nuncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one\nof the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we\nstatistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in\nbrain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our\nfindings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,\nleading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and\ndegrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning\n(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is\ntrained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each\nlearning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also\nintroduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic\nforgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new\nAngular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned\nknowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our\napproach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various\nbenchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods."}

To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse\nEncoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation\nmetrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically\ndescribing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more\nthan 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE\ndemonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in\nsynthetic images with more than 93\\% accuracy in natural images.

Moreover, it lacks a generic\ncriterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this\nlimitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to\nselect informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first\nformulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.\nAfterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and\nthe original set of vision tokens, simultaneously.

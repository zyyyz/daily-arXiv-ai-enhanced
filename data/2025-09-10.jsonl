We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP\ndataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in\nboth batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we\ndemonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et\nal. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and\nfeature shifts.

Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model\nvulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.\nAlthough current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the\ntransferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or\ndirectly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic\nfeatures and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,\ntheir reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to\ngradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example\nquality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and\npropose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we\npresent a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent\ninputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,\nwhich stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to\npreserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from\ntargeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing\nproblem of cross-entropy loss.

However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are\nrarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain\ngaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We\npropose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key\ncomponents. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and\npose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare\nrefinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy\ndiversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with\nsynthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D\ngeneration to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging\nbenchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further\ndemonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the\npracticality of our method in real-world manipulation.

In this paper, we present\nVIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization\nstrategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of\npre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this\nalignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details\nfrom the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual\nknowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex\nvisual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all\ntasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct\ncomprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying\nour framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction\nfor the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs."}

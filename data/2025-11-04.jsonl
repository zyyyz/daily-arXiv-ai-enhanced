While such models support users in a variety of creative\ntasks, they lack the embodied nature of human interaction. Dance, as a primal\nform of human expression, is predestined to complement this experience. To\nexplore creative human-AI interaction exemplified by dance, we build an\ninteractive model based on motion capture (MoCap) data. It generates an\nartificial other by partially mimicking and also \"creatively\" enhancing an\nincoming sequence of movement data. It is the first model, which leverages\nsingle-person motion data and high level features in order to do so and, thus,\nit does not rely on low level human-human interaction data. It combines ideas\nof two diffusion models, motion inpainting, and motion style transfer to\ngenerate movement representations that are both temporally coherent and\nresponsive to a chosen movement reference. The success of the model is\ndemonstrated by quantitatively assessing the convergence of the feature\ndistribution of the generated samples and the test set which serves as\nsimulating the human performer. We show that our generations are first steps to\ncreative dancing with AI as they are both diverse showing various deviations\nfrom the human partner while appearing realistic."}

A unified\nrepresentation of MRI contrast would enable a wide range of downstream\nutilities, from automatic sequence recognition to harmonization and quality\ncontrol, without relying on manual annotations. To this end, we introduce\nMR-CLIP, a metadata-guided framework that learns MRI contrast representations\nby aligning volumetric images with their DICOM acquisition parameters. The\nresulting embeddings shows distinct clusters of MRI sequences and outperform\nsupervised 3D baselines under data scarcity in few-shot sequence\nclassification. Moreover, MR-CLIP enables unsupervised data quality control by\nidentifying corrupted or inconsistent metadata through image-metadata embedding\ndistances. By transforming routinely available acquisition metadata into a\nsupervisory signal, MR-CLIP provides a scalable foundation for label-efficient\nMRI analysis across diverse clinical datasets."}

To resolve this tension, we question the\nbinary choice between CT and DT, inspired by the wave-particle duality of\nlight, and propose the Continuous-Discrete Dualistic Visual Tokenizer (CDD-VT).\nWe treat visual data as a flexible composition of image primitives derived from\nquantized codebooks, with the crucial insight that the primitive number\nassigned to each visual sample is adaptively determined according to its\ncomplexity: simple instances use a few primitives, emulating discrete\ntokenization, while complex instances use many, approximating continuous\ntokenization. Two core components are designed: Diverse Quantitative\nPrimitives, which encourage primitives orthogonality to better populate\ninformation space, and Dynamic Primitive Allocator, which assesses sample\ncomplexity to determine the optimal set of primitives. Extensive experiments on\nreconstruction, retrieval and classification show that CDD-VT achieves superior\nperformance over to specialized CT and DT, effectively getting strong result\nwithin a concise and scalable MLLM."}

A Pilot Study on Zero-shot Surgical Video Generation with Expert Assessment", "comment": null, "summary": "Foundation models in video generation are demonstrating remarkable\ncapabilities as potential world models for simulating the physical world.\nHowever, their application in high-stakes domains like surgery, which demand\ndeep, specialized causal knowledge rather than general physical rules, remains\na critical unexplored gap. To systematically address this challenge, we present\nSurgVeo, the first expert-curated benchmark for video generation model\nevaluation in surgery, and the Surgical Plausibility Pyramid (SPP), a novel,\nfour-tiered framework tailored to assess model outputs from basic appearance to\ncomplex surgical strategy. On the basis of the SurgVeo benchmark, we task the\nadvanced Veo-3 model with a zero-shot prediction task on surgical clips from\nlaparoscopic and neurosurgical procedures. A panel of four board-certified\nsurgeons evaluates the generated videos according to the SPP. Our results\nreveal a distinct \"plausibility gap\": while Veo-3 achieves exceptional Visual\nPerceptual Plausibility, it fails critically at higher levels of the SPP,\nincluding Instrument Operation Plausibility, Environment Feedback Plausibility,\nand Surgical Intent Plausibility. This work provides the first quantitative\nevidence of the chasm between visually convincing mimicry and causal\nunderstanding in surgical AI. Our findings from SurgVeo and the SPP establish a\ncrucial foundation and roadmap for developing future models capable of\nnavigating the complexities of specialized, real-world healthcare domains."}

Recent advances\nin RAG have investigated graph based retrieval for intricate reasoning;\nhowever, the influence of prompt design on enhancing the retrieval and\nreasoning process is still considerably under-examined. In this paper, we\npresent a prompt-driven GraphRAG framework that underscores the significance of\nprompt formulation in facilitating entity extraction, fact selection, and\npassage reranking for multi-hop question answering. Our approach creates a\nsymbolic knowledge graph from text data by encoding entities and factual\nrelationships as structured facts triples. We use LLMs selectively during\nonline retrieval to perform semantic filtering and answer generation. We also\nuse entity-guided graph traversal through Personalized PageRank (PPR) to\nsupport efficient, scalable retrieval based on the knowledge graph we built.\nOur system gets state-of-the-art performance on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA,\nwith F1 scores of 80.7% and 78.9%, and Recall@5 scores of 97.1% and 98.1%,\nrespectively. These results show that prompt design is an important part of\nimproving retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research lays the\ngroundwork for more efficient and comprehensible multi-hop question-answering\nsystems, highlighting the importance of prompt-aware graph reasoning."}

Textures of clouds\nand waves, the growth of cities and forests, or the formation of materials and\nlandscapes are all examples of patterns emerging from underlying mechanisms. We\npresent the Scitextures dataset, a large-scale collection of textures and\nvisual patterns from all domains of science, tech, and art, along with the\nmodels and code that generate these images. Covering over 1,200 different\nmodels and 100,000 images of patterns and textures from physics, chemistry,\nbiology, sociology, technology, mathematics, and art, this dataset offers a way\nto explore the connection between the visual patterns that shape our world and\nthe mechanisms that produce them. Created by an agentic AI pipeline that\nautonomously collects and implements models in standardized form, we use\nSciTextures to evaluate the ability of leading AI models to link visual\npatterns to the models and code that generate them, and to identify different\npatterns that emerged from the same process. We also test AIs ability to infer\nand recreate the mechanisms behind visual patterns by providing a natural image\nof a real-world pattern and asking the AI to identify, model, and code the\nmechanism that formed the pattern, then run this code to generate a simulated\nimage that is compared to the real image. These benchmarks show that\nvision-language models (VLMs) can understand and simulate the physical system\nbeyond a visual pattern.

Yet existing benchmarks fail to fully capture this advanced\ncapability. Even Visual Search, the most common benchmark for current\nthinking-\\textit{with}-images methods, tests only basic operations such as\nlocalization and cropping, offering little insight into more complex, dynamic,\nand tool-dependent reasoning. We introduce \\textbf{TIR-Bench}, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating agentic thinking-with-images across 13 diverse tasks,\neach requiring novel tool use for image processing and manipulation in\nchain-of-thought. We evaluate 22 multimodal large language models (MLLMs), from\nleading open-sourced and proprietary models to those with explicit tool-use\naugmentation. Results show that TIR-Bench is universally challenging, and\nstrong performance requires genuine thinking-with-images capabilities. Finally,\nwe present a pilot study comparing direct versus agentic fine-tuning."}

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the
development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited
availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are
restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for
real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related
to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually
relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more
closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone
determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that
simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized
recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision
points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical
framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments,
facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway
automation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of
structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced
storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs
often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated
CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup
Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed,
high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the
content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity
and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three
pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character
Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we
propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions.
CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written
scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated
by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a
prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event
logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound
scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and
demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality
screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user
behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are
viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection
based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl
algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial
behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is
quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed
for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense
vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation
learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the
frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on
temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined
to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e.,
WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art
methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Detecting surface landmines and unexploded ordnances (UXOs) using deep
learning has shown promise in humanitarian demining. However, deterministic
neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks,
leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the
idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated
into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO
classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC
Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional
metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed
decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially
perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag
unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept
study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises
awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to
adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust
and reliable models for practical applications.

Abstract: Combining complementary imaging modalities is critical to build reliable 3D
coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but
limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from
limited spatial resolution and artefacts (e.g., blooming). Prior work
demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is
tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while
offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline
integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment
algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend
suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments. The package accepts CSV/NumPy
inputs including data formats produced by the AIVUS-CAA software

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual
perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict
physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three
physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the
evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about
alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that
isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion
prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance
should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak
correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not
consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This
counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual
and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal
understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and
reasoning more tightly.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency on
neuromorphic hardware due to their sparse activation patterns. However,
conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in
performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that
grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN
training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced
self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation.
Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto
lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model
itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike
traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality
self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple
the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only
reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that
our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN
training. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet
current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access
disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are
limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and
fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate
post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We
introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for
dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a
purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional
neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an
intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review
-- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model
capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification
outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill
medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This
seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion
characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring
guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between
visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers
within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical
translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving
clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward
deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively
supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient
education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of
gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise
events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two
additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective
classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing
classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the
Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer
(ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset
with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a
classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision
Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by
effectively distinguishing transient noise.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse
objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent
on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based
goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the
agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast,
existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D
coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen
objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be
processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance
calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9%
reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can
be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any
positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from
scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical
robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask
generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale
dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution
of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these
small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution
approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the
Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR
observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope
(BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a
relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model
effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine
details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE)
of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC)
of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative
performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset
expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in
multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among
the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and
relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have
received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ
(Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a
training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing
accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and
object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions.
It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core
components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that
links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual
and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for
subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that
guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and
benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations,
while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core
modules.

Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly
important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing
face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when
deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high
resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage.
MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a
standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent
projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited
image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling.
Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only
improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over
existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g.,
up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g.,
a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of
MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution
image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

Abstract: Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking
system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D)
information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on
the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and
Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore,
a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either
do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point
Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various
model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three
different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time
pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in
front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is
based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head
pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their
own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a
Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm
on the same dataset, but we show that using no pre-trained GAN module leads to
a mean Euclidean error of 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with a
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are
coherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the
model with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\deg} and
without Transformer module 3.26{\deg}, whereas the fundamentally different
model architecture used by the dataset authors Zhang et al. achieves a mean
angular error of 2.04{\deg}. On the OTH-Gaze-Estimation dataset created for...

Abstract: Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes
into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function.
Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has
enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but
its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a
scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25
m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted
EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints,
achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000
parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process
datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure.
The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates
across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has
been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural
complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be
extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal
computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal
monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for
biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing
climate.

Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video,

illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to
predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing
FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or
computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions
detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer
Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and
annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding
space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability
via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),
yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering
and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that
achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly
doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,
heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond
faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations
and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first
recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm
state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and
robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish
TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability
assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across
modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and
scope.

Abstract: The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of
roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to
observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on
roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary
for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events.
However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT
by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this
study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera
images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained
on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human
labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry,
poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet
the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related
road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on
completely unseen cameras.

Abstract: Thermal images from low-cost cameras often suffer from low resolution, fixed

imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these
challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages
the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In
this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping
patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge,
this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior
for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising,
super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated
and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration
pipeline.

Abstract: Superpixels have long been used in image simplification to enable more

leveraging classical shape descriptors, SIGRID encodes both color and shape
information of superpixels while substantially reducing input dimensionality.
We evaluate SIGRIDs on four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional
segmentation architectures. Our results show that, despite compressing the
original data, SIGRIDs not only match but in some cases surpass the performance
of pixel-level representations, all while significantly accelerating model
training. This demonstrates that SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between
accuracy and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modeling human-human interactions from text remains challenging because it
requires not only realistic individual dynamics but also precise,
text-consistent spatiotemporal coupling between agents. Currently, progress is
hindered by 1) limited two-person training data, inadequate to capture the
diverse intricacies of two-person interactions; and 2) insufficiently
fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, where language conditioning
collapses rich, structured prompts into a single sentence embedding. To address
these limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate
realistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable
high-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal
coordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable
synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction
descriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a
motion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions,
trains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural
motion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction
coverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a
text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves
token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive
interaction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint
pairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained
interaction modeling. Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion
diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution
scenarios and user studies. We will release code and models to facilitate
reproducibility.

Abstract: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of
frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos. We
propose KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework that jointly leverages
captions and visual context to estimate frame-level importance. By combining
semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, KeyScore
identifies the most informative frames for downstream tasks such as retrieval,
captioning, and video-language reasoning. To complement KeyScore, we introduce
STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals), which
generates compact and diverse frame candidates for long-form videos. Together,
these modules achieve up to 99\% frame reduction compared to full-frame
inference and substantially outperform standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT,
MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results demonstrate that emphasizing multimodal alignment
between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and
caption-grounded video understanding -- without explicit video summarization.

Abstract: Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties
such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos
and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated
by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences
can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g.,
"does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked
retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is
detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this
problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences,
given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose
a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for
temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP,
with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and
other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with
temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively.
Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and
actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a
19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot
text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Limited-angle electron tomography aims to reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D
projections of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) within a restricted range
and number of tilting angles, but it suffers from the missing-wedge problem
that causes severe reconstruction artifacts. Deep learning approaches have
shown promising results in alleviating these artifacts, yet they typically
require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth which
are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy. To address these challenges, we
propose TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework.
Our method is trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a
simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling the model to learn
realistic structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. By
operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff implicitly enforces consistency
across slices without the need for additional regularization. On simulated
electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage, TEMDiff outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality. We further demonstrate that
a trained TEMDiff model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under
different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as
narrow as 8 degrees, with 2-degree increments, without any retraining or
fine-tuning.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified
understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust
image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often
rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms,
leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations,
or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework
that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for
efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the
high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a
lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual
information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent
space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally,
a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space.
We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than
commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE
latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image
generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from
11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding
capabilities.

Abstract: While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision
tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted
trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a
post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers
and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these
cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),
weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness
(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a
spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts
and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,
they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise
without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on
ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a
large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster
paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably
flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident
predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes,
textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that
cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and
human-readable explanations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly
those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural
inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational
adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational
complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the
Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently
leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core
idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.
First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates
a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single
monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by
modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a
rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the
Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across
these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,
SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures
intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is
designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing
accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively
balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will
be made publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point
clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated,
uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature
enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling
effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D
spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an
ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty
maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are
back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a
three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and
compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this
pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove
forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address
two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which
features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12
annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact
nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm
the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset
tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation
pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii)
empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling
scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological
monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training
distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a
CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the
model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design
features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate
artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images
from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,
this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that
maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without
corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in
sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against
baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT
dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean
images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional
augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen
artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high
classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact
data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for
artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification
performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained
with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to
uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation
can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring
expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for
deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

Abstract: Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding
and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically
employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large
language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic
expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To
address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a
continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and
understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional
features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile
these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture
involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.
Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual
representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single
autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and
generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly
supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,
generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous
visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers
by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art
level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate
unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model
weights are released to benefit community.

Abstract: Deep learning advances have revolutionized automated digital pathology
analysis. However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can
introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color
inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired
under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain
shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color
normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing
artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To
address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model
that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as
object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging
process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via
algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to
extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology
images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we
evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally
curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection
and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain
normalization methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models depends heavily on training data.
The scarcity of large-scale, well-annotated datasets poses significant
challenges in creating robust models. To address this, synthetic data generated
through simulations and generative models has emerged as a promising solution,
enhancing dataset diversity and improving the performance, reliability, and
resilience of models. However, evaluating the quality of this generated data
requires an effective metric. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset
Quality Metric (SDQM) to assess data quality for object detection tasks without
requiring model training to converge. This metric enables more efficient
generation and selection of synthetic datasets, addressing a key challenge in
resource-constrained object detection tasks. In our experiments, SDQM
demonstrated a strong correlation with the mean Average Precision (mAP) scores
of YOLOv11, a leading object detection model, while previous metrics only
exhibited moderate or weak correlations. Additionally, it provides actionable
insights for improving dataset quality, minimizing the need for costly
iterative training. This scalable and efficient metric sets a new standard for
evaluating synthetic data. The code for SDQM is available at

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its
widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI
reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by
reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In
recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress
in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches
proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are
difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised
reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI
reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a
physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively
constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the
powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's
interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental
results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR
achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised
learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike

English-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language
generalization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel
framework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture
that employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio
and video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the
influence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and
video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units
of speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization
issues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which
establishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In
addition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12
diverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and
evaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits

Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance,

the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to

wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural
Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack
far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and
categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first
time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of
multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone
meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive
evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral
data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines,
highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field. The

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground

implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model
(MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs
lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications,
and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present
StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises
structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded
natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and
verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects
path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then
fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with
supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases
(KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single
autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and
interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over
the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product
quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of
surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and
interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed
models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address
both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated
neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over
convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design
enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range
semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of
manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search
space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates
supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a
searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to
enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime
efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD
incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient
architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial
defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection
platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

modeling on visual signals and beyond.

Abstract: Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven
generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face
limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies
solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing
details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven
generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking
broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel
tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support
both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete
and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We
introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model
framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1)
using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and
concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training
data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the
extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based
editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index
encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish
images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training
with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex
instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these
two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has
achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in
autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex
conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide
complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust
perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited
viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these
challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating
light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we
proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation
network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to
segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature
completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image
pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps,
enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves
the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better
occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71
Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38
mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations
while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded
optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian
Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations
often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar
transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level
to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time
frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only
one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates
effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view
synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.

risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century
Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical
Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside
protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12
multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR
while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from
incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves
performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with
guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus
digitization.

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting
reliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient
sequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and
lack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address
these issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware
State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution
(MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from
high-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation.
MDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient
features and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive
experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer
parameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the
effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail
enhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from
prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can
hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of
diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel
one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression
of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff
revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex
architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning
granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA
heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the
iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an
error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian
construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme,
assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error
accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise
sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration
process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with
minimal degradation in visual quality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted
with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional
characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a
histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target
Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing
cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising.
This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it
approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect
and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise
complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise,
intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain
histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial
correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser
gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises,
including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating
pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in
high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In
this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on
existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the
problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,
Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived
land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning
(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and
predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the
actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct
supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to
link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the
low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the
former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in
the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the
presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels
can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution
labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a
Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020
IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed
framework compared to standard training strategies.

Abstract: Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning
typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that
contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work,
we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model
on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data.
Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework
by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while
inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to
control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the
model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our
approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual
question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%,
respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16
datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B
surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining
highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning
can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many
interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely
data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly
chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up
to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects
that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an
expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is
partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we
consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides
motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our
method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences
so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make
use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we
consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free
approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the
presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object
detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the
out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine
decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even
outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a critical tool for detecting heart diseases. Recently,
ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound
images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high
operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly
skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination
services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by
foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is
designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior
sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by
the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past
explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action
Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode
vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in
sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a
pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment
strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance
models. Our code will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast
vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval,
where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language
rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP
are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage,
preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we
introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes
vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based
adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set
of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance
while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput
inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while
requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr
(zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints
will be made publicly available shortly.

Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as
powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as
prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However,
existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of
the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To
address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize
swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to
reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by
intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of
key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple
yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we
provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.
Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method
demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the
references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts. Our code
is available \href{https://github.com/naver-ai/StyleKeeper}{here}.

Abstract: Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of

data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or
struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment
detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event
rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i)
velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a
fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints.
Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates
real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantifies human actions in videos,
supporting applications in sports scoring, rehabilitation, and skill
evaluation. A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality
distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability
of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA
with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient
fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image
classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical
analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is
necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT
induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting.
To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization
(MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers
while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a
manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current
representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global
distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with
tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic
cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline
and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and
effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to interpret long-form videos
through the lens of human perception. However, current GEBD methods require
processing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing
data online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task,
Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries
of generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique
challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time,
without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)
which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging
the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework
consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the
Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a
prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely
on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively
adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture
diverse, subtle event transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that
Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video
understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD
methods on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

Abstract: With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing

arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed
ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed
sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study
investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for
object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow
to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling
systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are
trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using
standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that
while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the
model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high
confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved
contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving
onboard AI for remote sensing.

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile
robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on
resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often
face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse
convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of
neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but
lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,
many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve
performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing
phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded
platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR
semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing
methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design
the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture
representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a
multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple
abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing
accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that
HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all
state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is
comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster. The code is

Abstract: Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding
all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images.
The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is
tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the
acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this
paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning.
The main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how
important is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most
critical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling.
These exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the
optimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity
and ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current
change detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the
positive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative
methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content
creation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual
data. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by
reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby
improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of
pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To
overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive
framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the
core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which
decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic
information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the
quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly
enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a
Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context
Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the
semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window
to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we
introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that
dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance
to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence,
improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for
autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model
not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates
superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our
structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where
failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D
adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems
and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However,
existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have
two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and
prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the
text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically
realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to
LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we
present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors
influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity,
and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with
multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the
insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation
(Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively
refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To
ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool
containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate
3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six
state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and
physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical
applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential
for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of
objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task.
Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or
train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper,
we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the
surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize
conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered
by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For
multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates
curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of
achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

Abstract: The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a
cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches,
particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance
detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object
queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the
inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD
\textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a
global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic
modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the
distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a
carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation
Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit,
global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations
on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach,
demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared
to leading baselines.

Abstract: Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and
challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of
text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in
long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear
in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior
works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer
from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits
their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we
build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the
inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the
ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new
benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using
this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights
that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)
enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of
information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a
novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning
Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption
quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision
of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%
to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track
different individuals in the captions of long videos.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing
realistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these
models to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture
data and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a
post-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes
pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without
requiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained
text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion
policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the
model's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on
paired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and
leave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across
both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative
metrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the
quality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the
original distribution. Our approach is a flexible, data-efficient, and
privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation.

Abstract: The temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps is of great importance to
model the evolution and change of the land cover over the years. In this paper,
we focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly
satellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian
modelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer
Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i)
intricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in
multiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an
HMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type
sequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning
47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the
importance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs
enhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of
the proposed approach.

Abstract: Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical
image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped
variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive
benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely
because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of
efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we
present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that
evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates
models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot
generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,
U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering
a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis
and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale
evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and
architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most
suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We
provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to
reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,
U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a
foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the
next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models. The project can be accessed at:

Abstract: A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input

conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or

and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach
grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding
space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors
necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this
neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure
that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery, the task of identifying and localizing objects

potential objects in images. To address challenges such as noisy attention maps
or complex scenes with varying depth planes, DADO employs dynamic weighting to
adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on the global
characteristics of each image. We evaluated DADO on standard benchmarks, where
it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and
robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept
hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts
within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the
faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept
Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique
that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target
concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports the generation of saliency-based
explanations that are more interpretable.

paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method
designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To
induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between
frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares
optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization
framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D
points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This
formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric
priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate
that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view
synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however,
it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data
privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm
that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when
dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This
study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity
normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of
heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for
brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of
the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training
and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to
inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of
92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These
results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing
models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical
applications. The code is available at:

Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new

challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical
images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape
or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs
operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,
making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To
address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for
Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding
to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features
and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer
module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning
mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this
approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our
generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream
segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten
remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used
few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying
backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance
can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some
RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The
variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing
methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for
few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a

Abstract: Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models

of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on
established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after
compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the
perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate
compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token
compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals
that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced
compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive
experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are
noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to
serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual
token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an

achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset
and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the
camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which
effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To
maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view
human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference
video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a
robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates
the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive
experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art
effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning,
but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with
fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL
models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices
improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically
tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across
seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:
ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and
1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The
primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2
achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to
512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and
ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across
initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models
using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned
86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation.
Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains
were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In
chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the
benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical
upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest
performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,
these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for
chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting
subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care
settings.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of
machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have
recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex
data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress,
recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose
EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum
of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that
posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift,
leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear
spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior
covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for
OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace
iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward
evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,
with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains
robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing
diffusion-based methods often fail.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately

in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as
fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic
prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis

Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or
sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve
these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization
strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play
multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis,
clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory
module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic,
interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts.
Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement
strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration.
Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7%
demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and
image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the
effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy. The code is

Abstract: In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to
facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike
existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers
164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with
diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The
dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X
motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning
and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we
present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple
baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director,
orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker
gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis
of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video
generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven
settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the
cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech
videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in
controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal
learning.

Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients
with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results
for automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application
remains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation
Models (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if
they can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we
systematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches
for this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal
images--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different
training regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and
OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do
not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an
EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and
precision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing
promising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive
zero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted
appropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for
fine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning,
suggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce
environments.

Abstract: Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity
verification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various
transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and
adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we
introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible
image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden
convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency
domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed
by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform
approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.
In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse
attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,
ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder
leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark
pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We
evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,
capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed
SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To ensure reproducibility,
the full code is released on

Abstract: Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model
multi-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How
do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate
MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance
mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that
formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via
video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture
instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video
attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We
find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization
that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask
tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.
We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware
video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and
semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations
validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture
fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation
performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting
in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.
Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view
first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views
alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with
geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme
viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first
4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.
WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and
incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate
geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,
which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent
wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,
Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with
superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the
average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the
anchor-wrist view gap.

Abstract: This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model
based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality,
flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative
depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive
performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent
space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details.
Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation
in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high
complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel
designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which
incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to
prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency
while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that
progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and
accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published
generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all
other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the
intersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and
quantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are
processed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages
quantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.
non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot
find a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,
quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time
scalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can
also become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural
networks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new
algorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and
unveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.
This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic
review of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference
for the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,
scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise
themselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its
specifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware
and QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.
gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the
operational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,
program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing
quantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to
publishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social
implications.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object
referred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require
end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be
computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS
problem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing
foundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,
video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and
Selection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while
leaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt
image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object
segmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to
produce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While
high-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily
identified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt
Preference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.
By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,
we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,
enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.
Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet
framework.

While this\npattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with\nthe prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the\ndenoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.\nIn this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:\nduring training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of\nthe latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a\nprompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector\nthat applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.\nConditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware\ncounterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,\nwithout modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first\nsample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding\nimages from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a\nreward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct\npreference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no\nreference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference\ncost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive\nexperiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves\ntext-image alignment across diverse prompts."}

While recent\npointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great\nprogress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic\nscenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving\nobjects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the\nreconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages\ntemporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to\n4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of\ncorrespondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train\na dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,\nfacilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from\nthe static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.\nFurthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to\nrecover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the\ncorrespondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling\nfully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework\nachieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across\nmultiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,\nand point tracking.

While recent\nadvances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion\nand fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability\nissues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,\nadding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are\ncomputationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their\nability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the\nU-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically\ncaptures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution.

This reliance often leads to\na failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the\nreference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in\npose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability\nand limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we\n(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for\nmulti-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)\nintroduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the\ntrade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel\ntraining paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data\nto balance fidelity with diversity.

Our training data consists of\nclose-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from\nmotion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,\nPonimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that\nuses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive\nposes, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize\ninteractive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are\nunavailable.

In this paper, we present\nTerra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable\nenvironments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel\npoint-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into\na latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian\nprimitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse\npoint flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point\nrepresentation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the\npoint latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D\nrepresentation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any\nviewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves\nexplorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent\nspace. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from\nScanNet v2.

However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the\npretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new\ntraining paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our\napproach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during\ntraining and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each\ninput and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the\ninstruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for\nend-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution\nmatching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the\nimage manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard\nbenchmarks and include an extensive ablation study.

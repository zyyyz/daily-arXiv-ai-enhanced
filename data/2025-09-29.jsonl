To address this gap, we introduce the Textual\nDynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based\nsurrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a\nstatic single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the\nfarthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that\ndeviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing\ndisruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim\nmodels (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting\nadversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language\nmodels with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a\nmaximum attack success rate of 50.81\\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,\nreaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\\%.

A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference\nimage to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent\nvision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their\nreference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We\nintroduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with\nVLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through\nrelative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a\nmoderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question\nanswering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the\nVLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained\nsegmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level\nsegmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two\nin-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently\noutperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding\nmore accurate segmentations and more reliable localization.

Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic\nunderstanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods\ntypically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive\nmaps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from\nspatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which\nimpede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in\nhuman navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the\nright brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework\nfeaturing a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and\nvisual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural\nrepresentations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior\nknowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial\nreasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the\nhistorical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic\nencoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs\nof tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,\nenabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nJanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For\nexample, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using\nmultiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB\ntraining data.

Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,\nrisk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable\ntrade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection\nand mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious\nintention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative\ncapabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we\nleverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a\nnoise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high\naccuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative\nguidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the\nprominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive\nnegative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on\nboth natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance\nover existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and\nresources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM."}

To solve this problem, we introduce\nneuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary\nVLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)\nto impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)\nformulated in a neural network architecture.

Specifically, RelateSeg automatically\nextracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them\nas first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel\nlearns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., \"cat\") and a spatial pseudo\ncategory (e.g., \"right of person\") simultaneously, enforcing relational\nconstraints (e.g., a \"cat\" pixel must lie to the right of a \"person\"). Finally,\nthese logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy\nlogic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally\nconsistent segmentation.

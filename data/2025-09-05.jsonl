Previous\nstudies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can\ncause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and\nocclusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view\nbias.

However, dense prediction is\ninherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather\nthan T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.\n  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning\nbehaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our\nfindings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which\nenable them to converge more stably by ``refining\" their innate features, and\nultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.\n  Based on these findings, we introduce \\textbf{FE2E}, a framework that\npioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer\n(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the\neditor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow\nmatching loss into the ``consistent velocity\" training objective. And we use\nlogarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's\nnative BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.\nAdditionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint\nestimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their\nsupervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.\n  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance\nimprovements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple\ndatasets. Notably, it achieves over 35\\% performance gains on the ETH3D dataset\nand outperforms the DepthAnything series, which is trained on 100$\\times$ data.\nThe project page can be accessed \\href{https://amap-ml.github.io/FE2E/}{here}."}

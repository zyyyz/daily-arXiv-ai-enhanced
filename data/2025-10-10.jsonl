This paper will present a\nreal-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing\naugmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study\nemploys RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature\nfusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between\nsynthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the\ndetection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most\nreliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap\nbetween synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined\nend-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and\naccuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to\nbalance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and\naccuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime\ndetection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under\npractical limits.

To\naddress these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of\nsystematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with\n45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V\nmodels. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background\nscene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene\nconsistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion\nsmoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric\nshows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:\nocclusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.\nBuilding on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages\nobject error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our\nsecond innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that\ntracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object\nfidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve\nstronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the\nmodel level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval\nas a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic\ncamera motion."}

With\nthis in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question\nAnswering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused\nsolely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance\nannotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that\nmodel performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated\ndriving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,\nour study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the\nsimplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared\nto humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%\nhuman performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size\nwas relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify\nspecific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain\nparticularly challenging for these models."}

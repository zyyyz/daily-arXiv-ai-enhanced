This capability is essential\nfor optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression.\nConventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to\ncapture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is\nhence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically\nsimulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in\ngenomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care\nDigital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies\nreaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery,\nchemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization\nto predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit\nexponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures\nstability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated\non both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently\noutperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in\npredicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern\ndifferentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for\npatient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent\ntumor dynamics estimation.

Performance evaluation\nof the proposed method on three databases containing contrast distortions\n(CCID2014, TID2013, and CSIQ), indicates the promising performance of the\nproposed method."}

This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular\nClassifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image\nclassification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone\nfor localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture\nglobal semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is\nincorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data,\nenriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is\nthe neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that\ndynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by\nbiological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data\ncomplexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification,\nwe validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2),\nwhich involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental\nresults across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms\ntraditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic\nModular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world\nimage classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and\nindustrial domains."}

To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic\ninvestigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training,\nand an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3\nmillion high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing\nprograms and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on\nit, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a\nlightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage\ntraining curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion,\nand reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at\ninference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for\ngeneration and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an\naccompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\\&A\nprotocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models\nreveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory.\nOur model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning\nyields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset,\nmodel, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for\nstructured visuals."}

We study inter-character\ninteraction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve\neach character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context\ninteraction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and\nbecause mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters\nappear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these\nissues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and\nbehavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation\n(CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style\ndata. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously\nuncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a\ncurated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show\nclear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and\nrobustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative\nstorytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page:\nhttps://tingtingliao.github.io/mimix/."}

Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state\ntransitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and\nmultimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and\nfuture prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain,\na novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual\nreasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically,\nVChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to\ngenerate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used\nto guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only\nat these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal\noverhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex,\nmulti-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of\ngenerated videos."}

Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves\ndistinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal\ninformation (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple\naligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101\nresearch papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and\nspeaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta\nSimilarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos\nconvey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we\npropose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation\nvideo generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout\nrefinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,\nsubtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing\nslide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate\nthat the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and\ninformative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward\nautomated and ready-to-use academic video generation.

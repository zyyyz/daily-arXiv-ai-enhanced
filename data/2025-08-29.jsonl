Despite\nshowcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue\nis the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the\nuser's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer\nthe MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In\ncontrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build\nsynthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary\nmodels, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to\ngauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of\ngenerated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options\n(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf\nMLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we\nrefer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated\nanswers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of\nfine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward.

However, existing image forgery\nlocalization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly\nannotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image\nmanipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to\nintegrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into\nan image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery\nlocalization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of\nSD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to\ninherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this\nfoundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable\nDiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the\nmulti-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating\nimage forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific\nhighpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the\nlatent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.\nNotably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,\nthereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.\nExperimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in\nperformance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current\nstate-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model\ndemonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document\nforgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were\nentirely unseen during training."}

However, obtaining\nhigh-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this\nissue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB\nimages as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these\nmethods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB\nimages. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to\nthe quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms\nof LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a\nnovel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at\nan early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance\nsegmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional\nfusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,\nwhile 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To\nmitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and\nglobal filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth\nestimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove\nsegmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion\nbased dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes\nunder a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector\ntrained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous\nstate-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation\nbenchmark."}

Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba\narchitectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high\ncomputational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an\nemerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive\nfields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work\nthat studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that\ndirectly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's\nfixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial\ndistortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local\ngeometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention\nin RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through\nexponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.\nTo this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored\nfor DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and\ncross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In\nparticular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local\nneighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness.

However, current methods face two major limitations.\nFirst, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which\nstruggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,\nthey largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is\nessential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in\nhandwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot\nhandwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent\ntext from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to\nbetter capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We\nfurther introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages\nhigh-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated\nsamples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that\naligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby\nenhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting\ndatasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent\nhandwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource\nhandwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines.

Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by\nvisual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics\nand temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding\nas a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel\ntraining-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by\nMaximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,\nwe first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then\ndynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal\ngain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm\nthat jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby\nmaximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid\ncan maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly\nimproving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original\nperformance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the\nprefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B.

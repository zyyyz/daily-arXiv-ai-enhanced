While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective\nfor image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities\nsuch as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene\nunderstanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs\nremains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on\nspecialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison\nof fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and\nfine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay\ndetection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs\ncan be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to\nachieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based\nbaselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring\nhow language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with\nminimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging\nvision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal\nlearning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data\nefficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and\nprovide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in\nlow-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,\nwe have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,\nenabling future improvements and reuse in related applications."}

We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for\nuniversal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a\ndiverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as\nreal-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most\nappropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a\nmulti-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest\ntier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for\ninterpretability.

Video-based monitoring, combined with deep\nlearning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and\nit can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present\nCattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour\nrecognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based\nvisual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language\nmodel CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap\nbetween web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle\nsurveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and\nspecialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised\nand few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce\nbehaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock\nmonitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6\ndataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,\nstanding-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and\nlying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John\nOldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.\nExperiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six\nbehaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,\ndrinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust\ngeneralisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the\npotential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis."}

Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that\noverestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In\nthis work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP\ntask. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.\nNext, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt\nFine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a\nteacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the\n\"overthinking\" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively\ninjects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its\nreasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed\nstrategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approaches.

To address this gap, we introduce\nBLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging\nperceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require\nmodels to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from\nlanguage-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception\nbenchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception (\"see\") and requires\nfine-grained observation and analytical reasoning (\"observe\"). BLINK-Twice\nintegrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing\nvisual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on\nvisual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of\nthe reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading\nMLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.\nBLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing\nreasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or\nself-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and\nredundant reasoning.

By integrating action modules into these\npretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,\ntraining them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet\neffective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution\ncapability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our\narchitecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token\nand a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action\nknowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform\nlightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the\nsmall action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder\nand avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the\nlanguage model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to\nintegrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the\naction token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future\nactions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics\nnot captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains\nover training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous\nstate-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on\nLIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In\nreal-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently\noutperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),\nwhich demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate\nprecise actions while substantially reducing training costs."}

Processing entire videos\nwith full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance\non long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as\nthey either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant\nrecomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for\nreal-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a\nunified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During\ninference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,\na short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text\ntokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning\n(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,\nwhich effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training\non prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a\nnew benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,\nper-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM\nachieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time\nperformance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy\nalso enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,\nimproving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by\n+5.96.

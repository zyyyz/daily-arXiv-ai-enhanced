To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first\nend-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain\nalignment.

To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy\nof explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,\ne.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local\nregions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual\ndescriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language\nalignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder\nfundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded\nin long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing\nboth visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a\nnovel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and\nprocess lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an\nautomated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,\nlong-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we\nconstruct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million\nsamples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and\npropose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating\nfine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual\ndescriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP\nshowcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form\ntexts, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}

However, reliable evaluation of image quality\nremains a challenge as current texture- and distribution-based metrics quantify\nimage fidelity rather than the accuracy of IHC staining. Here, we introduce an\nautomated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across\nsixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,\nwe generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by\neach virtual IHC model. We use the segmented masks of real and virtual IHC to\ncompute stain accuracy metrics (Dice, IoU, Hausdorff distance) that directly\nquantify correct pixel - level labeling without needing expert manual\nannotations. Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,\nincluding Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),\nand structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and\npathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE\nachieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based\nmodels are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.\nMoreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are\ninvisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level\nbenchmarks.

This is especially problematic for vision-centric\nbenchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic\nprinciple for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.\nDesigners should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using\ndiagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate\nnon-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test\nset'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.\n  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose\nbenchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.\nOur primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language\nModel via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual\ninputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a\nbias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based\ndiagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.\nSecond, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an\n``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure.

Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering\nnarrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that\nrequire true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we\npresent VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial\nrecall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting).

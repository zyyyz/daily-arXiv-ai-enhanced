While techniques like\nActive Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying\ninformative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight\nof human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an\nemployed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)\napproaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine\nlearning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),\neffective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.\nThis thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and\ninvestigating \"VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection\".\nVILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,\ntogether with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to\nexplore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse\nsample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An\nempirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,\nthrough its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of\ndistinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset\ncharacteristics more interpretable (RQ1).

This research addresses this\ngap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We\nsystematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and\nYOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical\ninfrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior\nanalysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper\ninsights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our\nresults reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,\nrather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing\nthe backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a\nshallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These\nconfigurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up\nto 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average\nprecision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning.

Most\nexisting GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,\nrelying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably\ndiscover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the\nvideo domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively\nintegrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate\nVideo-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided\nConsistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly\ncaptures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning\nthrough a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core\ncomponents: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided\nRepresentation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal\nfeatures to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are\nthen used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a\ndual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level\nrepresentations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness\nand inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation\nin CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation\nlearning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we\nconstruct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action\nrecognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD\napproaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of\ntemporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will\nbe publicly available."}

Our key innovation is semantic\ndescriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each\nimage patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce\nimage-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of\nsegmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling\npipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding\n(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of\nsemantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\\times$, without\ncompromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg\nachieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.\nTo further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic\ndescriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and\nrepresents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks.

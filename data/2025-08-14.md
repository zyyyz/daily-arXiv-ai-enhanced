Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed
towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection
face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions
tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a
novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist
content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module
(MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the
Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive
gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on
relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant
features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual
modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features
such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set
of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the
text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the
predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has
been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and
13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average
improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI
and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing,
yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods
to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their
performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this
challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to
VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially
enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage
training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT)
stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset
(Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and
establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group
Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward
functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly
Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves
significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in
average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably,
the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models
including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model
weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on
the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter
AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing
attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are
restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning
capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which
function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper,
we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection
in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a
symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge,
salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables
particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method
-- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of
pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle
filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy
improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack
scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and
interpretable cognitive attack detection.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the
fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as
blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable
trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction
attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we
propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into
privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image
transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic
accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of
replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously
generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a
practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in
privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and
autonomous vehicle networks.

Abstract: Affective computing faces a major challenge: the lack of high-quality,
diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. We
propose a framework for synthetic depth face generation using an optimized GAN
with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) to stabilize training, improve
quality, and prevent mode collapse. We also apply Genetic Algorithms to evolve
GAN latent vectors based on image statistics, boosting diversity and visual
quality for target emotions. The approach outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in
both diversity and quality. For classification, we extract and concatenate LBP,
HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features, achieving 94% and 96%
accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation using FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR shows
consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in
plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to
enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data
to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically
requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection
challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands
while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their
alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF
remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This
data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided
masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs
without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By
computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states
masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses
sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that
$\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data,
accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1%
in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad
applicability across modalities and architectures.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based
affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and
healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle
expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in
real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source
model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,
storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging
scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled
target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods
are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.
Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions
can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized
feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image
translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent
space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform
the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.
Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression
consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on
neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By
translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face
expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for
classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces
computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part
of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed
transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit
emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress,
current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the
generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their
reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional
states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic
benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities
of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and
\textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for
MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific
questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight
emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with
hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a
multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced
MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key
insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional
intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$
recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark.
\ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional
intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while
specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance
through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion,
we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional
intelligence in the future.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language
reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a
serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of
harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success
rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or
unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current
evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To
address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that
considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output
harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective
jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:
highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those
that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.
However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade
filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a
recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).
The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned
sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the
inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source
MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful
outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success
rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously
underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.

\textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily

generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the
largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80
million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller},
the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a
relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined
pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly
release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further
research building upon our contributions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced
novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time
photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical
limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when
persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during
density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that
prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of
Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to
redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases
memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present
Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware
adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key
innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized
gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant
versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting
mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.
Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting
operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant
concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS
promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion
while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive
evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS
achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating
over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact
scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized
Gaussians utilization.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology,
Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential

However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental
flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while
neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world
applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first
evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations,
designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web,
mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a
four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To
analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the
plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first
quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on
our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8%
fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments,
quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual
localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic
framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current
GUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully

Abstract: As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become

in their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained
segmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost
of usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy
protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information
while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained
segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our
framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26%
of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by
11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of
history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction,
these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most
appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved
performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical
settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel
input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show
that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without
substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three
adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial
efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an
agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based
adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal
efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of
views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we
demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three
off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn

Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in
various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and
diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,
such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing
generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and
anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address
these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous
model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary
DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a
better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on
the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves
8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower
GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.
Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.
We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing
the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the
proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can
effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,
highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor
synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging. The code and pretrained
models are available at https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM-PLUS.

features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based
fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the
outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble
classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments
demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for
Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse
spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and
accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges,
including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel
sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these
issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a
dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we
propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head
self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based
skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a
Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that
captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to
comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging
Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The
proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on
the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US
task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work.
In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th
in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings
validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed
for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance
improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research. The source

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability
due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and
tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated
or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are
particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In
this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion
segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due
to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically
significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA),
measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that
IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a
mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by
utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning
objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across
multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic
datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/skin-IAV.

Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent
representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions,
body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely
on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our
approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a
compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression,
one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly
expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed
cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses,
and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,
end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent
representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on
large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is
enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D
renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we
guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained,
semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments
show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly
expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object
detection lies in the pervasive influence of coherent noise. As a common
practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep
learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object
spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we
propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective
to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a
carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2
is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and
phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which
enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive
experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\%
improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the
model complexity by half. The code is available at

which are notoriously difficult for conventional sensors like RGB cameras,

innovative Dice-Contour Regularization Loss to ensure precise detection.
Experimental results demonstrate that our event-based approach achieves mean F1

Abstract: This paper presents a low cost, on premise system for autonomous backyard

short clips via FTP to a local server, where frames are sampled and birds are
localized with Detectron2; cropped regions are then classified by an
EfficientNet-B3 model fine tuned on a 40-species Belgian subset derived from a
larger Kaggle corpus. All processing runs on commodity hardware without a
discrete GPU, preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees. The physical feeder
uses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers.
Detector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame
classification. The classifier attains high validation performance on the

(top-1 about 88 percent) on held-out species, demonstrating feasibility for
citizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home.

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions
are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve
fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban
environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses
from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of
temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human
motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale
dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with
explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our
key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the
quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The
dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios,
including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to
250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting
benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its
value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human
behavior understanding in complex urban environments. The dataset and code will

Abstract: Curb ramps are critical for urban accessibility, but robustly detecting them
in images remains an open problem due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality
datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with
crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either
quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline
called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model
performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated
Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb
ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we
train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated
dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our
pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset
achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches
0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first
large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a
specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of
the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to
complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts
and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work,
we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic
distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with
LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred
from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian
fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into
the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D
and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D. Codes

Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To
comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is
essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and
\textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often
inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both
action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts
high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our
proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior
Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the
Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and
the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global
interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware
Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images
that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms
baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each
architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon
publication.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing
field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and
criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression
(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from
psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a
scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.
While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative
representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to
capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective
MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to
adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt
tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion
magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts
for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into
the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced
distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted
on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its
effectiveness.

Abstract: Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) improves upon Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) by leveraging high-quality reference images to enhance
texture fidelity and visual realism. However, a critical limitation of existing
RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image
pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To
overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new
and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant
high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality
input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as
enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where
category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily
collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we
construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike
prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides
per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further
propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever
with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based
on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with
semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet
consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131
LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight
retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between
academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled
datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and
reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using
satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral
remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the
scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel
knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned
representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective
development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical
knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a
simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across
different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building
upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi
foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.
HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by
introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel
alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function
tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral
domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for
geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly
improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction
fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover
classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,
underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote
sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a
reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in
recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which
usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in
industries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could
only generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the
videos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute
this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to
comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose
sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes
Animate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character
types, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,
we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern
from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former
leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of
motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,
while the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible
inputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we
introduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and
TI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this
approach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background
dynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new
Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of
Animate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks
such as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based
on natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual
grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of
backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor
attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This
attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,
regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that
embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the
original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the
open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we
utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned
and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating
attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its
feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches
over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on
manipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on
clean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and
potential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our
attack.

  Furthermore, we design a lightweight, query-based mask decoder that supports

GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for
information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the
generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated
fine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared
to previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the
generated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of
the target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer

improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to
generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with
mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has
received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has
become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI
adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the
neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking
neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel
Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation
that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi
2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and
instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust
fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the
established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification
of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive
3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the
limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to
reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose
CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation
that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and
zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of
non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data
preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to
enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To
resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a
hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established
according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the
graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between
categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ
hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot
generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a
``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but
generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model
performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for
analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task,
where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant
improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,
deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world
distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network
(FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet
differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for
training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,
mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be
gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,
each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is
classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a
comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative
models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\%
compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on
real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a
few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under
large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in
exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT
structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing
open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations.
First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically
combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to
capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The
identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic
expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves
pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to
mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline
centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face
Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial
regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features
across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial
angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this
pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from
existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with
annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate
that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior
SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The
code and dataset will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/rain152/LFA-Video-Generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of
AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images,
which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the
conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs
(generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection
performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed
a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly
detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a
generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use
the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing
flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by
applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for
training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images,
optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by
various image generators.

Abstract: In this work, we present GazeLT, a human visual attention
integration-disintegration approach for long-tailed disease classification. A
radiologist's eye gaze has distinct patterns that capture both fine-grained and
coarser level disease related information. While interpreting an image, a
radiologist's attention varies throughout the duration; it is critical to
incorporate this into a deep learning framework to improve automated image
interpretation. Another important aspect of visual attention is that apart from
looking at major/obvious disease patterns, experts also look at
minor/incidental findings (few of these constituting long-tailed classes)
during the course of image interpretation. GazeLT harnesses the temporal aspect
of the visual search process, via an integration and disintegration mechanism,
to improve long-tailed disease classification. We show the efficacy of GazeLT
on two publicly available datasets for long-tailed disease classification,
namely the NIH-CXR-LT (n=89237) and the MIMIC-CXR-LT (n=111898) datasets.
GazeLT outperforms the best long-tailed loss by 4.1% and the visual
attention-based baseline by 21.7% in average accuracy metrics for these
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/lordmoinak1/gazelt.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a
long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its
variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing
methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with
rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization
capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,
but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to
limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel
self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable
3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for
improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and
radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need
for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency
Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via
consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy
that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization
methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.
It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to
1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong
cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently,
recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a
small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods
simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal
relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual
continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information,
diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To
address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework
inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate
robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as
isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered
episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics
necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore,
the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to
iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic
memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs.
Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench
benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly
competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective
baselines while utilizing fewer frames.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing
attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious
concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have
achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when
facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models,
since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this
limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images.
Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity
to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely
Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic
difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The
hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully
capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts
during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images,
which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By
quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative
feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization,
outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and
CommunityForensics.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to
protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent
deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and
accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language
model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information,
resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding
conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and
accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we
integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to
enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing
existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed
degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing
the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction
strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction,
CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced
loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and
key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind
achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a
balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily

people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those
who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and
generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing
individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still
needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network
(ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention
Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium
resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image
generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant
that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and
class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model
generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and
words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12,
respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating
high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and

critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online
Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that
eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements
(AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a
primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of
external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural
language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the
first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI
challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective
judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise
semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking
finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively
exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or
even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we
propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as
external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB
trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic
cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant
advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a
standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking
research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their
self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to
suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches
introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics,
applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting
adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large
language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX)
significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful
adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We
introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel
Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent
decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention
based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the
fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content
fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with
learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K
classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new
paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.

Abstract: Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing
(CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed

measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at
reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer
two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the
ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements.
To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and
theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with
minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks'
superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents,
called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware
cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations.
We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a
measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences
demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and
spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module,
correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale
features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape

Abstract: Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming
symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of
asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this
assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo
matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we
explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume
construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume
experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be
comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the
two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching
(IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the
correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine
details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance
against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on
benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of
our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation
(GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually
coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of
initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured
inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively
leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability
to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by
decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which
predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and
(2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent
instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks
are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained
with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity.
Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies,
one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive
processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal
dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain
generalization.

closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the
distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic
images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments,
we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic
data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale
of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show
quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set
generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given
training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are
generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to
quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve
comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical
image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline
training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.

Abstract: Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on
topological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via
formally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.
  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids
(e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their
ratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The
resulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,
and SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural
network (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.
  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy,
outperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The
topological features showed high accuracy with low variance.
  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal
digital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,
interpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when
explainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can
apply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing,
and interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces
robust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.

Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather
perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two
inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that
constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled
scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present
WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes
weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the
text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a
Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large
multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through
human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,
and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the
scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the
dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight
and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized
by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and
image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather
conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate
that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall
rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it
improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog

Abstract: Multi-exposure correction technology is essential for restoring images
affected by insufficient or excessive lighting, enhancing the visual experience
by improving brightness, contrast, and detail richness. However, current
multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing
intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting
environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured
at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under
complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure
Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we
introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment
Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure
consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses
miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to
recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the
light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the
Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes
low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing
high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain
details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction
and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its
effectiveness and practical applicability.

text lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the
results. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which
not only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides
basis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of
diagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically
accurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via
diagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language
model with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a
diagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated
sentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding
module is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the
working efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we
propose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to
leverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead
to 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a
evaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion
location and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist
models consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by
accurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.

Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models,
such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance
control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models
often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture
fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address
these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF)
system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models.
The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that
recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given
appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides
latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating
structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained
generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as
transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically
coherent, and structurally consistent image generations. Our source code is

Abstract: Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer
from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or
established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality
hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness
hallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained
analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or
reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To
address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline
that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also
design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input
perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs,
we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to
assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained
hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction
pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and
6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios.
Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality
hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

eventually fusion methods to provide veritable and precise object trajectories
along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level

evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled
data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or

framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario
in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for
glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low
availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological
connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often
ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To
address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates
structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It
features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal
attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a
personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity
and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that
Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved
robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in
computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent
advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,
head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due
to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and
global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head
Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the
geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled
texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two
types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance
of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture
editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of
non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence
between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping
method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp
texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization
strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both
reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble
dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results,
but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian
head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image
generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores,
state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images,
especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global
distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual
samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance
generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing
outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its
misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,
we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving
perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify
low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure
modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from
poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings
consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also
shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and
challenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn
attention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind
LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been
explored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student
model by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference
cost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective
distillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and
Camera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the
student's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network
combines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared
latent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the
framework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's
Inequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into
teacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and
strengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging
nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an
improvement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than
the improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first
3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation
exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full
3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising
process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further
contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from
chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We
performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,
scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11
clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10)
dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE
pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in
imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that
performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the
performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across
distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner
geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning
across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic
applications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample
Consensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic
guarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it
susceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly
prevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is
unknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this
limitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on
model information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the
observed depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability
distributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing
different candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated
random sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics
and noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each
model, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely
ground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective
mechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false
positive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be
ranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We
validate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that
our algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the
default Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our
algorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,
which enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in
real-world data.

Abstract: In the task of 3D Aerial-view Scene Semantic Segmentation (3D-AVS-SS),
traditional methods struggle to address semantic ambiguity caused by scale
variations and structural occlusions in aerial images. This limits their
segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian
point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a
learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This
module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian
points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness.
Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation
pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when
ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation
accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging
benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse
real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation
accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable
solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

Abstract: We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an
afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can
actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in
high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image
appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an
underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that
embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense
alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach
assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps
images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a
textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is
self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To
isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment
HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand
pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism,
demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

Abstract: Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural
development and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal
complications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of
standard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and
personalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and
unclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for
fine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast
Fusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed
information from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower
layers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By
assigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast
conditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining
minimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a
curated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results
demonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a
minimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast
attention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,
contributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.
Conclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal
torso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature
representation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports
clinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating
strong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening. The codes are

Abstract: Parotid gland lesion segmentation is essential for the treatment of parotid
gland diseases. However, due to the variable size and complex lesion
boundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging.
Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable
performance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's
interaction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts
(points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world
applications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are
automatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when
performing segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid
gland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM
incorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion
segmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided
prompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information
containing the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion
segmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module,
which integrates the complementary information of different modalities to
enhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and
generated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result.
Experimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent
clinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness
of diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical
settings.

Data are provided without annotations for training, while validation and test
performance are evaluated on manually annotated anatomical landmarks. Metrics
include target registration error (TRE), robustness to worst-case landmark

Abstract: Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the
extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through
the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections
or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their
susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to
ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse
problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging
reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively
assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a
parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping,
facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction
framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm
unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also
enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data,
thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local
spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed
information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.
Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real
datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates
remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point
data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

Abstract: The use of synthetic data as an alternative to authentic datasets in face

privacy, ethical, and practical concerns associated with collecting and using
authentic data. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed
identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face
images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods
often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability,
leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal
FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method
that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion
process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative
conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while
preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of
data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity
separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from
2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the
NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without
negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views
is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in
noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage
generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they
struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations.
To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to
improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs.
The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built
upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders
and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the
input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic
features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual
geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency
when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable
benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which

Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a
NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods
in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D
motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising
a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised
state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose
parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field
(InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical
scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a
rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel
correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to
obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a
defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our
multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient
pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and
SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of
kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our
approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art
methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other
approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing
feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable
NeRF-based reconstruction.

Abstract: Facial representation pre-training is crucial for tasks like facial
recognition, expression analysis, and virtual reality. However, existing
methods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial
features and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure
inherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled
data. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that
combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach
integrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that
preserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial
regions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination
with multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that
preserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves
state-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2
million unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant
improvements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and
lighting conditions. We believe this work advances facial representation
learning and offers a scalable, efficient solution that reduces reliance on
expensive annotated datasets, driving more effective facial analysis systems.

Abstract: Irrelevant features can significantly degrade few-shot learn ing performance.
This problem is used to match queries and support images based on meaningful
similarities despite the limited data. However, in this process, non-relevant
fea tures such as background elements can easily lead to confu sion and
misclassification. To address this issue, we pro pose Slot Attention-based
Feature Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SAFF) that leverages slot attention
mechanisms to discriminate and filter weak features, thereby improving few-shot
classification performance. The key innovation of SAFF lies in its integration
of slot attention with patch em beddings, unifying class-aware slots into a
single attention mechanism to filter irrelevant features effectively. We intro
duce a similarity matrix that computes across support and query images to
quantify the relevance of filtered embed dings for classification. Through
experiments, we demon strate that Slot Attention performs better than other
atten tion mechanisms, capturing discriminative features while reducing
irrelevant information. We validate our approach through extensive experiments
on few-shot learning bench marks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet and tieredIma
geNet, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the
performance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing
methods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the
reference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of
relying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we
propose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal
attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for
reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).
Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and
introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention
weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an
additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features,
effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level
color alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant
storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained
clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by
using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes
cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a
fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays,
preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the
image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based
representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived
from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies
downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for
pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size
while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming
other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent,
task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and
clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without
sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates.
Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification
serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection.
However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for
comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches
combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms
for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular,
graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within
heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling
missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and
consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms
baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data
scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid
diagnostics. Our source code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous

runway detection. However, ensuring that these systems meet the robustness and
safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In
this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose
estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to
certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our
approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural
architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint
regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii)
a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which
are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of
Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling
runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and
evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show
that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while
also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision
that can be used downstream for fault detection.

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with
long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and
auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic
memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world
knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal
format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.
Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative
reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the
task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal
agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.
M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's
perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse
scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test
key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,
general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results
show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the
strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,
achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web
and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward

Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite
image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent
diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable
results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail
preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic
datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to
capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization
capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting
information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach
preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,
generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model
R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in
the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.
To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with
Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the
foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background
regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random
Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a
suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and
challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic
dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our
dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our
code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across multi-modal tasks by scaling model size and training data. However,
these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the
exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve
parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model
modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains
challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and
Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is
guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality
experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model
to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We
further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy,
which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal
capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM
backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our
approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters
match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs
based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is

Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching,
to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods
for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical
surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration.
In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking
shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method
thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface
shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each
other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation
by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The
proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and
allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on
geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method,
consistently outperforming the state of the art. Project page:

Abstract: Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization
ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks
recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot
class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new
concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the
same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective
approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal
modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely,
we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each
Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the
pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and
dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy
transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we
leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse
semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then
adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top
of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat
state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our
DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than
existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic
forgetting issue as well.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves
continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a
significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and
severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally
limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over
Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches
real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association
struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To
address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT
tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter
(MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches
between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU
(Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height
similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association
failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT
show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of
67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by
multiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness
which encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function
(SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet
interactions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics
applications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods
struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific
features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this
work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention
(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based
SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached
after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map
attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability
of the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and
HMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training
even with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR
material datasets.

learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies
on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of
\textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue,
from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and
\textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding
masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen
photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not
seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual
labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved
a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\%
Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels.

integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail
to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as
object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the
motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is
that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and
orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system
for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters
to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three
existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets
demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the
task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that
multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the
learned physical parameters.

Abstract: Elephant Poaching in African countries has been a decade-old problem. So much
so that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and
African Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International
Union for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their
ivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic
modification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that
though poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather
dynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several
other factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts
in poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from
2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again --
WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached
annually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near
towns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of
these factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify
poaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable
poaching regions. A CV model eliminates the need to manually track poachers and
account for the environmental factors to deploy resources and its combination
with satellite imagery allows us to survey large areas without disturbing local
species or cross border aviation restrictions.

Abstract: During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an
intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality
assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study
investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two
key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop
under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual
features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also
increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training
progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations,
improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human
perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying
learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off
between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.

yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human
action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages
of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic
video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in
the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human
behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that
contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We
developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled
samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show
that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion
understanding, and behavior interpretation.

action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames
and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and
facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with
inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further
improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show
that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the
performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately
predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings
underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world
knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used
in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does
not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their
mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been
established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we
propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to
effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a
regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its
kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure
its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct
a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,
1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like
structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional
convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,
leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image
restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants
of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,
respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this
work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and
applications.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface
reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from
RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often
computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed
method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance
field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our
pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet
distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work
together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet
distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface
points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from
point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional
generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward
pass across unseen datasets in testing.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to
evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial
variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both
local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural
network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships
between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity.
Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with
well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage
feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation.
To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent
viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions
across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases
with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong
generalization capability.

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the main 3D technique for imaging the
internal microstructures of materials. Quantitative analysis of the
microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are
implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging
artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume.
Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to
segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In
this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively
analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through
the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects
within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase
identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection
limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D
analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.

data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human
judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models
exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing
dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images
more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization
further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training
cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training
strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important
considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.

Abstract: Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to
facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant
spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation.
Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time,
and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior
performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video
VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between
discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively
preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization
methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster
than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.
Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how
continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we
introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB
improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,
to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we
strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this
information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x
16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous
optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,
achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete
representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect
this connection.

Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of
human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However,
current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency}

preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene
inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these,
we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and
generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1)
\textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from
monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2)
\textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and
refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose
Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences
using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes
photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion,
refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis
achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis,
video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving
expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions,
especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic
shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for
multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises:
how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving
dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous
approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain
adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance
when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal
Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).
Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that
create a universal representation space and then collaborate with
source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing
complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging
cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for
small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three
evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration
datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP
improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our project is available at:

Abstract: Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on
RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on
adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range.
Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and
high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene
reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this
end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting
approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with
fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization
scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting
for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance
pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while
incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We
design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras
surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark
multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our
approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves
the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel
approach for rapid scene capture.

Abstract: Detection of face forgery videos remains a formidable challenge in the field

synergy between audio and visual speech elements, embarking on a novel approach
through audio-visual speech representation learning. Our work is motivated by
the finding that audio signals, enriched with speech content, can provide
precise information effectively reflecting facial movements. To this end, we
first learn precise audio-visual speech representations on real videos via a
self-supervised masked prediction task, which encodes both local and global
semantic information simultaneously. Then, the derived model is directly
transferred to the forgery detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without the participation of any
fake video in model training. Code is available at

these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell
analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei
covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts,
HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by
5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer
parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types
and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show
that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during
training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model

Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges

small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data
distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate
synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising
solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG
models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription
settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically
compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative
adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their
impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics
of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative
guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our
analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and
highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to
low-resource HTR.

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image

have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing
iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated
inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise
levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to
further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n
sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT
Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 %
of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)
above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time
from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers
substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also
assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling
inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate
that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without
significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of
diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have
demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to
leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having
to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for
computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve
specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and
limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable
Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL).
Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the
self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly
incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any
additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is
able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object
detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and
colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection
over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by
8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv,
respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to
effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task
better and further improve the performance.

Abstract: We introduce LIA-X, a novel interpretable portrait animator designed to

linear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a
novel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial
dynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'
approaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X
to support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise
manipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This
helps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and
expression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully
training a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on
extensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method
outperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment
tasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and
controllable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as
fine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait
video manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLFMs)

classification via zero-shot adaptation. However, these methods remain
outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches
trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI

a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a
classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic
pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC
outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the
TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art

Abstract: Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first,
a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a
single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity
representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid
cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and
impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach,
learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but
struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement.
We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches
to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a
single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate
pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.
To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we
introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced
sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in
diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes
geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse
poses.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful alternative
to Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for 3D scene representation, offering
high-fidelity photorealistic rendering with real-time performance. Beyond novel
view synthesis, the explicit and compact nature of 3DGS enables a wide range of
downstream applications that require geometric and semantic understanding. This
survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in 3DGS
applications. It first introduces 2D foundation models that support semantic
understanding and control in 3DGS applications, followed by a review of
NeRF-based methods that inform their 3DGS counterparts. We then categorize 3DGS
applications into segmentation, editing, generation, and other functional
tasks. For each, we summarize representative methods, supervision strategies,
and learning paradigms, highlighting shared design principles and emerging
trends. Commonly used datasets and evaluation protocols are also summarized,
along with comparative analyses of recent methods across public benchmarks. To
support ongoing research and development, a continually updated repository of
papers, code, and resources is maintained at

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal
capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due
to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address
these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.
However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)
Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,
hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)
Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance
in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,
without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce
LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,
plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five
representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and
model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal
redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods
degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)
Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal
performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire
future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard
generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject
identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial
composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we
introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:
Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across
panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual
features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these
mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,
enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet
consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf
language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.
To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain
narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded
storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene
Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.
Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that
Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging
storyboards than existing baselines.

Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong
performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.
Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance
open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question
remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural
source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?
In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they
can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy
or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.
Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often
contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text
descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds
and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image
alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale
synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image
data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we
fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.
In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and
challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which
increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and
Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and
generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance
across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other
foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains
across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.

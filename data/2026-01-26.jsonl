Existing solutions for 3D scene relighting often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, and are as such unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Though recent progress in using generative image and video diffusion models for relighting has been promising, these techniques are either limited to 2D image and video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects. Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets to show that it can faithfully render novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions."}

However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

However, domain shifts and heterogeneity in data often lead to a degradation in model performance. Medical imaging applications are particularly affected by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL), a novel framework designed to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data in federated environments. FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data. Our experiments further highlight the importance of jointly learning the template and the task. These findings suggest that FeTTL offers a principled and extensible solution for mitigating distribution shifts in federated learning, supporting robust model deployment in real-world, multi-institutional environments."}

In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources. Our findings underline the importance of modular architectures that can handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and the need for complementary training procedures that can maximize cross-modal synergy."}

For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution. We created a multi-modal dataset of panel paintings with a high number of keypoint annotations, and a large test set comprising five multi-modal domains and varying image resolutions. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of all modules of our refinement method. Our proposed approaches achieve the best registration results compared to competing keypoint and dense matching methods and refinement methods."}

These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning."}

While recent methods have integrated textual semantics to complement visual data, they predominantly rely on features pre-trained on natural scenes, thereby neglecting the granular, domain-specific semantics essential for industrial inspection. Furthermore, prevalent fusion strategies often resort to superficial concatenation, failing to address the inherent semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which compromises robustness against cross-modal interference. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes VTFusion, a vision-text multimodal fusion framework tailored for FSAD. The framework rests on two core designs. First, adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities are introduced to learn task-specific representations, bridging the domain gap between pre-trained models and industrial data; this is further augmented by generating diverse synthetic anomalies to enhance feature discriminability. Second, a dedicated multimodal prediction fusion module is developed, comprising a fusion block that facilitates rich cross-modal information exchange and a segmentation network that generates refined pixel-level anomaly maps under multimodal guidance. VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance, achieving image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in the 2-shot scenario on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, respectively. Furthermore, VTFusion achieves an AUPRO of 93.5% on a real-world dataset of industrial automotive plastic parts introduced in this paper, further demonstrating its practical applicability in demanding industrial scenarios."}

In this paper, we propose a cosine network for image super-resolution (CSRNet) by improving a network architecture and optimizing the training strategy. To extract complementary homologous structural information, odd and even heterogeneous blocks are designed to enlarge the architectural differences and improve the performance of image super-resolution. Combining linear and non-linear structural information can overcome the drawback of homologous information and enhance the robustness of the obtained structural information in image super-resolution. Taking into account the local minimum of gradient descent, a cosine annealing mechanism is used to optimize the training procedure by performing warm restarts and adjusting the learning rate. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution."}

Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format.

VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images.

By leveraging Class Activation Map (CAM) analysis, LPKEM guides the domain expert to focus exclusively on discriminative features essential for classification. Subsequently, to effectively integrate this knowledge, we design an Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM). This module dynamically corrects the local model's decisions by considering both overall category uncertainty and instance-level prediction uncertainty.

Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces."}

However, generating a complete 360° scene from a single image remains a highly ill-posed and challenging problem. Recent approaches have made progress by leveraging diffusion models and depth estimation networks, yet they still struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting their effectiveness in full-scene generation. To address this, we propose AnchoredDream, a novel zero-shot pipeline that anchors 360° scene generation on high-fidelity geometry via an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism. Given a single-view image, our method first performs appearance-guided geometry generation to construct a reliable 3D scene layout. Then, we progressively generate the complete scene through a series of modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block, which ensures seamless transitions between the input view and generated regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility--all in a zero-shot manner. Our results highlight the potential of geometric grounding for high-quality, zero-shot single-view scene generation."}

In this work, we introduce OnlineSI, a framework that can continuously improve its spatial understanding of its surroundings given a video stream. Our core idea is to maintain a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates.

The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion.

In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory.

As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization.

Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep.

Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress.

Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks. Experiments on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets demonstrate that CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and while significantly reducing the parameter overhead."}

These forces are typically modeled as vectors connecting ligament landmarks on adjacent vertebrae, making precise identification of these landmarks a key requirement for constructing reliable spine models. Existing automated detection methods are either limited to specific spinal regions or lack sufficient accuracy. This work presents a novel approach for detecting spinal ligament landmarks, which first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae and subsequently applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of attachment points. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches by achieving high accuracy and demonstrating strong generalization across all spinal regions. Validation on two independent spinal datasets from multiple patients yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 mm and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 mm."}

Most PASS methods often focus on spherical geometry with RGB input or using the depth information in original or HHA format, which does not make full use of panoramic image geometry. To address these shortcomings, we propose REL-SF4PASS with our REL depth representation based on cylindrical coordinate and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion SMMF. REL is made up of Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, and Lateral Orientation Angle, which fully represents 3D space in cylindrical coordinate style and the surface normal direction. SMMF aims to ensure the diversity of fusion for different panoramic image regions and reduce the breakage of cylinder side surface expansion in ERP projection, which uses different fusion strategies to match the different regions in panoramic images. Experimental results show that REL-SF4PASS considerably improves performance and robustness on popular benchmark, Stanford2D3D Panoramic datasets. It gains 2.35% average mIoU improvement on all 3 folds and reduces the performance variance by approximately 70% when facing 3D disturbance."}

However, predicting aesthetic experiences remains difficult due to the subjective nature of perception and the complexity of visual responses. This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design."}

To address the gap, we introduce ColorConceptBench, a new human-annotated benchmark to systematically evaluate color-concept associations through the lens of probabilistic color distributions. ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance). This demonstrates that achieving human-like color semantics requires more than larger models, but demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning."}

Across ImageNet-1k CNNs and Transformers, this proxy is strongly negative with Top-1 and positive with loss. Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor. Validation labels are never used beyond reporting. The probe adds much less than 0.1% of an epoch and works as a drop-in for validation-free checkpoint selection and early stopping."}

Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization. Our code will be released at https://github.com/X-yangfan/GPA-VGGT."}

However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization."}

While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation."}

However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation."}

In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation."}

Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually.

SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information.

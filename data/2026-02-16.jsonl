This paper characterizes the extraction of these three biosignals from facial thermal video using a signal-processing pipeline that tracks anatomical regions, applies spatial aggregation, and separates slow sudomotor trends from faster cardiorespiratory components. For HR, we apply an orthogonal matrix image transformation (OMIT) decomposition across multiple facial regions of interest (ROIs), and for BR we average nasal and cheek signals before spectral peak detection. We evaluate 288 EDA configurations and the HR/BR pipeline on 31 sessions from the public SIMULATOR STUDY 1 (SIM1) driver monitoring dataset. The best fixed EDA configuration (nose region, exponential moving average) reaches a mean absolute correlation of $0.40 \\pm 0.23$ against palm EDA, with individual sessions reaching 0.89. BR estimation achieves a mean absolute error of $3.1 \\pm 1.1$ bpm, while HR estimation yields $13.8 \\pm 7.5$ bpm MAE, limited by the low camera frame rate (7.5 Hz). We report signal polarity alternation across sessions, short thermodynamic latency for well-tracked signals, and condition-dependent and demographic effects on extraction quality.

However, the development of models that unify motion-language generation and understanding remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches often fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on paired motion-text data, which can result in catastrophic forgetting of linguistic capabilities due to the limited scale of available text-motion pairs. Furthermore, prior methods typically convert motion into discrete representations via quantization to integrate with language models, introducing substantial jitter artifacts from discrete tokenization. To address these challenges, we propose LLaMo, a unified framework that extends pretrained LLMs through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. This design inherently preserves the language understanding of the base model while enabling scalable multimodal adaptation. We encode human motion into a causal continuous latent space and maintain the next-token prediction paradigm in the decoder-only backbone through a lightweight flow-matching head, allowing for streaming motion generation in real-time (>30 FPS). Leveraging the comprehensive language understanding of pretrained LLMs and large-scale motion-text pretraining, our experiments demonstrate that LLaMo achieves high-fidelity text-to-motion generation and motion-to-text captioning in general settings, especially zero-shot motion generation, marking a significant step towards a general unified motion-language large model."}

Synthetic image detection (SID) has thus become an important area of research. Prior work has highlighted how synthetic images differ from real photographs--unfortunately, SID methods often struggle to generalize to novel generative models and often perform poorly in practical settings. CLIP, a foundational vision-language model which yields semantically rich image-text embeddings, shows strong accuracy and generalization for SID. Yet, the underlying relevant cues embedded in CLIP-features remain unknown. It is unclear, whether CLIP-based detectors simply detect strong visual artifacts or exploit subtle semantic biases, both of which would render them useless in practical settings or on generative models of high quality. We introduce SynthCLIC, a paired dataset of real photographs and high-quality synthetic counterparts from recent diffusion models, designed to reduce semantic bias in SID. Using an interpretable linear head with de-correlated activations and a text-grounded concept-model, we analyze what CLIP-based detectors learn. CLIP-based linear detectors reach 0.96 mAP on a GAN-based benchmark but only 0.92 on our high-quality diffusion dataset SynthCLIC, and generalization across generator families drops to as low as 0.37 mAP. We find that the detectors primarily rely on high-level photographic attributes (e.g., minimalist style, lens flare, or depth layering), rather than overt generator-specific artifacts. CLIP-based detectors perform well overall but generalize unevenly across diverse generative architectures. This highlights the need for continual model updates and broader training exposure, while reinforcing CLIP-based approaches as a strong foundation for more universal, robust SID."}

The method claims that accurate spatial control can be achieved by optimizing a single diffusion latent at an intermediate timestep, together with identity-preserving fine-tuning and spatial regularization. This work presents a reproducibility study of DragDiffusion using the authors' released implementation and the DragBench benchmark. We reproduce the main ablation studies on diffusion timestep selection, LoRA-based fine-tuning, mask regularization strength, and UNet feature supervision, and observe close agreement with the qualitative and quantitative trends reported in the original work. At the same time, our experiments show that performance is sensitive to a small number of hyperparameter assumptions, particularly the optimized timestep and the feature level used for motion supervision, while other components admit broader operating ranges. We further evaluate a multi-timestep latent optimization variant and find that it does not improve spatial accuracy while substantially increasing computational cost.

A Frankenstein-Style Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has become a standard post-training stage for boosting visual reasoning in vision-language models, yet it remains unclear what capabilities RL actually improves compared with supervised fine-tuning as cold-start initialization (IN). End-to-end benchmark gains conflate multiple factors, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific skills. To bridge the gap, we propose a Frankenstein-style analysis framework including: (i) functional localization via causal probing; (ii) update characterization via parameter comparison; and (iii) transferability test via model merging. Instead, RL induces a consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains. Overall, our results suggest that RL's reliable contribution in visual reasoning is not a uniform enhancement of visual perception, but a systematic refinement of mid-to-late transformer computation that improves vision-to-reasoning alignment and reasoning performance, highlighting the limitations of benchmark-only evaluation for understanding multimodal reasoning improvements."}

In this paper, we identify spurious visual semantic correlations in existing generative ZSL worsened by scarce seen class samples and introduce two metrics to quantify spuriousness for seen and unseen classes. Furthermore, we point out a more critical bottleneck: existing unadaptive fully noised generators produce features disconnected from real test samples, which also leads to the spurious correlation. To enhance the visual-semantic correlations on both seen and unseen classes, we propose ZeroDiff++, a diffusion-based generative framework. In training, ZeroDiff++ uses (i) diffusion augmentation to produce diverse noised samples, (ii) supervised contrastive (SC) representations for instance level semantics, and (iii) multi view discriminators with Wasserstein mutual learning to assess generated features. At generation time, we introduce (iv) Diffusion-based Test time Adaptation (DiffTTA) to adapt the generator using pseudo label reconstruction, and (v) Diffusion-based Test time Generation (DiffGen) to trace the diffusion denoising path and produce partially synthesized features that connect real and generated data, and mitigates data scarcity further.

However, standard training objectives only weakly encourage this decomposition, and existing monosemanticity metrics require pairwise comparisons across all dataset samples, making them inefficient during training and evaluation. We study a recent MonoScore metric and derive a single-pass algorithm that computes exactly the same quantity, but with a cost that grows linearly, rather than quadratically, with the number of dataset images. On OpenImagesV7, we achieve up to a 1200x speedup wall-clock speedup in evaluation and 159x during training, while adding only ~4% per-epoch overhead. This allows us to treat MonoScore as a training signal: we introduce the Monosemanticity Loss (MonoLoss), a plug-in objective that directly rewards semantically consistent activations for learning interpretable monosemantic representations. Across SAEs trained on CLIP, SigLIP2, and pretrained ViT features, using BatchTopK, TopK, and JumpReLU SAEs, MonoLoss increases MonoScore for most latents. MonoLoss also consistently improves class purity (the fraction of a latent's activating images belonging to its dominant class) across all encoder and SAE combinations, with the largest gain raising baseline purity from 0.152 to 0.723. Used as an auxiliary regularizer during ResNet-50 and CLIP-ViT-B/32 finetuning, MonoLoss yields up to 0.6\\% accuracy gains on ImageNet-1K and monosemantic activating patterns on standard benchmark datasets.

To this end, we introduce PathoSpatial, an interpretable end-to-end framework integrating co-registered WSIs and ST to learn spatially informed prognostic representations. PathoSpatial uses task-guided prototype learning within a multi-level experts architecture, adaptively orchestrating unsupervised within-modality discovery with supervised cross-modal aggregation. By design, PathoSpatial substantially strengthens interpretability while maintaining discriminative ability. We evaluate PathoSpatial on a triple-negative breast cancer cohort with paired ST and WSIs. PathoSpatial delivers strong and consistent performance across five survival endpoints, achieving superior or comparable performance to leading unimodal and multimodal methods. PathoSpatial inherently enables post-hoc prototype interpretation and molecular risk decomposition, providing quantitative, biologically grounded explanations, highlighting candidate prognostic factors.

However, it has been shown that the cosine similarity between a single image and a single hand-crafted template is insufficient to measure the similarity for image-text pairs. Building on this, in this paper, we find that the AEs generated using cosine similarity may fail to fool CLIP when the similarity metric is replaced with semantically enriched alternatives, making the image encoder fine-tuned with these AEs less robust. To overcome this issue, we first propose a semantic-ensemble attack to generate semantic-aware AEs by minimizing the average similarity between the original image and an ensemble of refined textual descriptions. These descriptions are initially generated by a foundation model to capture core semantic features beyond hand-crafted templates and are then refined to reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SAFT), which fine-tunes CLIP's image encoder with semantic-aware AEs. Extensive experiments show that SAFT outperforms current methods, achieving substantial improvements in zero-shot adversarial robustness across 16 datasets.

The production and quality of grapes are significantly impacted by grape diseases such as Bacterial Rot, Downy Mildew, and Powdery Mildew. Consequently, the sustainable management of a vineyard necessitates the early and precise identification of these diseases. Current automated methods, particularly those that are based on the YOLO framework, are often computationally costly and lack interpretability that makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios. This study proposes grape leaf disease classification using Optimized DenseNet 121. Domain-specific preprocessing and extensive connectivity reveal disease-relevant characteristics, including veins, edges, and lesions. An extensive comparison with baseline CNN models, including ResNet18, VGG16, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet, demonstrates that the proposed model exhibits superior performance. It achieves an accuracy of 99.27%, an F1 score of 99.28%, a specificity of 99.71%, and a Kappa of 98.86%, with an inference time of 9 seconds. The cross-validation findings show a mean accuracy of 99.12%, indicating strength and generalizability across all classes. We also employ Grad-CAM to highlight disease-related regions to guarantee the model is highlighting physiologically relevant aspects and increase transparency and confidence. Model optimization reduces processing requirements for real-time deployment, while transfer learning ensures consistency on smaller and unbalanced samples. An effective architecture, domain-specific preprocessing, and interpretable outputs make the proposed framework scalable, precise, and computationally inexpensive for detecting grape leaf diseases."}

Segmentation models, in contrast, optimize pixel-accurate masks that may misalign with such bodies. We ask whether and when these models nonetheless acquire human-like bodies. Using a time-to-collision (TTC) behavioral paradigm, we introduce a comparison pipeline and alignment metric, then vary model training time, size, and effective capacity via pruning. Across all manipulations, alignment with human behavior follows an inverse U-shaped curve: small/briefly trained/pruned models under-segment into blobs; large/fully trained models over-segment with boundary wiggles; and an intermediate ideal body granularity'' best matches humans. This suggests human-like coarse bodies emerge from resource constraints rather than bespoke biases, and points to simple knobs - early checkpoints, modest architectures, light pruning - for eliciting physics-efficient representations. We situate these results within resource-rational accounts balancing recognition detail against physical affordances."}

One particular application of this technique is slice-level content navigation, where the goal is to localize specific 2D slices within a 3D volume or determine the anatomical coverage of a 3D scan based on its 2D slices. This serves as an important preprocessing step for various diagnostic tasks, as well as for automatic registration and segmentation pipelines. Our approach builds sequence correspondence by training a network to learn how to insert a slice from one sequence into the appropriate position in another. This is achieved by encoding contextual representations of each slice and modeling the insertion process using a slice-to-slice attention mechanism. We apply this method to localize manually labeled key slices in body CT scans and compare its performance to the current state-of-the-art alternative known as body part regression, which predicts anatomical position scores for individual slices. Unlike body part regression, which treats each slice independently, our method leverages contextual information from the entire sequence. Experimental results show that the insertion network reduces slice localization errors in supervised settings from 8.4 mm to 5.4 mm, demonstrating a substantial improvement in accuracy."}

To enable learning beyond simple condition absence, we further construct a contextual clinical negation dataset that encodes structured claims and supports attribute-level negations involving location and severity. Building on these resources, we propose Negation-Aware Selective Training (NAST), an interpretability-guided adaptation method that uses causal tracing effects (CTEs) to modulate layer-wise gradient updates during fine-tuning. Rather than applying uniform learning rates, NAST scales each layer's update according to its causal contribution to negation processing, transforming mechanistic interpretability signals into a principled optimization rule.

These differences make precise image matching (co-registration) of these two types of images difficult. In this paper, we propose a new approach to image matching of optical and SAR images, which is based on transforming the images to a new modality. The new image modality is common to both optical and SAR images and satisfies the following conditions. First, the transformed images must have an equal pre-defined number of channels. Second, the transformed and co-registered images must be as similar as possible. Third, the transformed images must be non-degenerate, meaning they must preserve the significant features of the original images. To further match images transformed to this shared modality, we train the RoMa image matching model, which is one of the leading solutions for matching of regular digital photographs. We evaluated the proposed approach on the publicly available MultiSenGE dataset containing both optical and SAR images. We demonstrated its superiority over alternative approaches based on image translation between original modalities and various feature matching algorithms. The proposed solution not only provides better quality of matching, but is also more versatile. It enables the use of ready-made RoMa and DeDoDe models, pre-trained for regular images, without retraining for a new modality, while maintaining high-quality matching of optical and SAR images."}

To resolve this, we establish navdream, a high-fidelity robustness benchmark leveraging generative pixel-aligned style transfer. By creating a visual stress test with negligible geometric deviation, we isolate the impact of appearance on driving performance. Our evaluation reveals that existing planning algorithms often show significant degradation under OOD appearance conditions, even when the underlying scene structure remains consistent.

To leverage conventional image processing pipelines, events are typically binned into frames. However, binning functions are discontinuous, which truncates gradients at the frame level and forces most event-based algorithms to rely solely on frame-based features. Attempts to directly learn from raw events avoid this restriction but instead suffer from biased gradient estimation due to the discontinuities of the binning operation, ultimately limiting their learning efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for unbiased gradient estimation of arbitrary binning functions by synthesizing weak derivatives during backpropagation while keeping the forward output unchanged. The key idea is to exploit integration by parts: lifting the target functions to functionals yields an integral form of the derivative of the binning function during backpropagation, where the cotangent function naturally arises. By reconstructing this cotangent function from the sampled cotangent vector, we compute weak derivatives that provably match long-range finite differences of both smooth and non-smooth targets. Experimentally, our method improves simple optimization-based egomotion estimation with 3.2\\% lower RMS error and 1.57$\\times$ faster convergence. On complex downstream tasks, we achieve 9.4\\% lower EPE in self-supervised optical flow, and 5.1\\% lower RMS error in SLAM, demonstrating broad benefits for event-based visual perception.

Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance. Across multiple benchmarks, it outperforms prior pruning approaches in both efficiency and accuracy.

However, their iterative sampling process, which gradually morphs random noise into coherent images, introduces significant latency that limits their applicability. While recent few-step diffusion models reduce the number of sampling steps to as few as one to four steps, they often compromise image quality and prompt alignment, especially in one-step generation. Additionally, these models require computationally expensive training procedures. To address these limitations, we propose ImageRAGTurbo, a novel approach to efficiently finetune few-step diffusion models via retrieval augmentation. Given a text prompt, we retrieve relevant text-image pairs from a database and use them to condition the generation process. We argue that such retrieved examples provide rich contextual information to the UNet denoiser that helps reduce the number of denoising steps without compromising image quality. Indeed, our initial investigations show that using the retrieved content to edit the denoiser's latent space ($\\mathcal{H}$-space) without additional finetuning already improves prompt fidelity. To further improve the quality of the generated images, we augment the UNet denoiser with a trainable adapter in the $\\mathcal{H}$-space, which efficiently blends the retrieved content with the target prompt using a cross-attention mechanism. Experimental results on fast text-to-image generation demonstrate that our approach produces high-fidelity images without compromising latency compared to existing methods."}

This structural regularization induces controlled encoder-decoder information flow and stabilizes joint optimization. Across single-task denoising and joint denoising-classification settings, AddUNet achieves competitive reconstruction performance with improved training stability. In MTL, learned skip weights exhibit systematic task-aware redistribution: shallow skips favor reconstruction, while deeper features support discrimination. Notably, reconstruction remains robust even under limited classification capacity, indicating implicit task decoupling through additive fusion. These findings show that simple constraints on skip connections act as an effective architectural regularizer for stable and scalable multi-task learning without increasing model complexity."}

However, in the literature cloudless analysis is often performed where cloudy images are excluded from machine learning datasets and methods. Such an approach cannot be applied to time sensitive applications, e.g., during natural disasters. A possible solution is to apply cloud removal as a preprocessing step to ensure that cloudfree solutions are not failing under such conditions. But cloud removal methods are still actively researched and suffer from drawbacks, such as generated visual artifacts. Therefore, it is desirable to develop cloud robust methods that are less affected by cloudy weather. Cloud robust methods can be achieved by combining optical data with radar, a modality unaffected by clouds. While many datasets for machine learning combine optical and radar data, most researchers exclude cloudy images. We identify this exclusion from machine learning training and evaluation as a limitation that reduces applicability to cloudy scenarios. To investigate this, we assembled a dataset, named CloudyBigEarthNet (CBEN), of paired optical and radar images with cloud occlusion for training and evaluation. Using average precision (AP) as the evaluation metric, we show that state-of-the-art methods trained on combined clear-sky optical and radar imagery suffer performance drops of 23-33 percentage points when evaluated on cloudy images. We then adapt these methods to cloudy optical data during training, achieving relative improvement of 17.2-28.7 percentage points on cloudy test cases compared with the original approaches.

To address the limitation, we present IndicFairFace, a novel and balanced face dataset comprising 14,400 images representing geographical diversity of India. Images were sourced ethically from Wikimedia Commons and open-license web repositories and uniformly balanced across states and gender. Using IndicFairFace, we quantify intra-national geographical bias in prominent CLIP-based VLMs and reduce it using post-hoc Iterative Nullspace Projection debiasing approach. We also show that the adopted debiasing approach does not adversely impact the existing embedding space as the average drop in retrieval accuracy on benchmark datasets is less than 1.5 percent.

In particular, inference-time sampling strategies, which leverage the generative priors of large-scale pre-trained I2V models without additional training, have become increasingly popular. However, existing inference-time sampling, either fusing forward and backward paths in parallel or alternating them sequentially, often suffers from temporal discontinuities and undesirable visual artifacts due to the misalignment between the two generated paths. This is because each path follows the motion prior induced by its own conditioning frame. In this work, we propose Motion Prior Distillation (MPD), a simple yet effective inference-time distillation technique that suppresses bidirectional mismatch by distilling the motion residual of the forward path into the backward path. Our method can deliberately avoid denoising the end-conditioned path which causes the ambiguity of the path, and yield more temporally coherent inbetweening results with the forward motion prior. We not only perform quantitative evaluations on standard benchmarks, but also conduct extensive user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios."}

Prior work trains MCI encoders but typically evaluates them via full fine-tuning, leaving probing with frozen pre-trained encoders comparatively underexplored. Existing studies that perform probing largely focus on improving representations, rather than how to best leverage fixed representations for downstream tasks. Although the latter problem has been studied in other domains, directly transferring those strategies to MCI yields weak results, even worse than training from scratch. We therefore propose Channel-Aware Probing (CAP), which exploits the intrinsic inter-channel diversity in MCI datasets by controlling feature flow at both the encoder and probe levels. CAP uses Independent Feature Encoding (IFE) to encode each channel separately, and Decoupled Pooling (DCP) to pool within channels before aggregating across channels. Across three MCI benchmarks, CAP consistently improves probing performance over the default probing protocol, matches fine-tuning from scratch, and largely reduces the gap to full fine-tuning from the same MCI pre-trained checkpoints.

Traditional Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) methods rely on linear interaction histories, which struggle to handle long-context tasks, especially those involving information-sparse yet token-heavy visual data in iterative reasoning scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce VimRAG, a framework tailored for multimodal Retrieval-augmented Reasoning across text, images, and videos. Inspired by our systematic study, we model the reasoning process as a dynamic directed acyclic graph that structures the agent states and retrieved multimodal evidence. Building upon this structured memory, we introduce a Graph-Modulated Visual Memory Encoding mechanism, with which the significance of memory nodes is evaluated via their topological position, allowing the model to dynamically allocate high-resolution tokens to pivotal evidence while compressing or discarding trivial clues. To implement this paradigm, we propose a Graph-Guided Policy Optimization strategy. This strategy disentangles step-wise validity from trajectory-level rewards by pruning memory nodes associated with redundant actions, thereby facilitating fine-grained credit assignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VimRAG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse multimodal RAG benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/VRAG."}

Our approach couples a classical morphological detector with a learning-based refinement module: a SegFormer backbone adapted via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Uniquely, we employ a detector-guided strategy, injecting the morphological map as an input spatial prior, while a masked hybrid loss and logit adjustment constrain the training to focus specifically on refining candidate crack regions.

In this paper, we propose the Regional Brain Age Prediction Network (ReBA-Pred-Net), a Teacher-Student framework designed for fine-grained brain age estimation. The Teacher produces soft ReBA to guide the Student to yield reliable ReBA estimates with a clinical-prior consistency constraint (regions within the same function should change similarly). For rigorous evaluation, we introduce two indirect metrics: Healthy Control Similarity (HCS), which assesses statistical consistency by testing whether regional brain-age-gap (ReBA minus chronological age) distributions align between training and unseen HC; and Neuro Disease Correlation (NDC), which assesses factual consistency by checking whether clinically confirmed patients show elevated brain-age-gap in disease-associated regions.

Then, we employed the priors in a Decomposed Diffusion Sampling scheme on sparse-view CT data sets with increasing difficulty leading to the experimental data. Our results reveal that domain shift plays a nuanced role: while severe mismatch causes model collapse and hallucinations, diverse priors outperform well-matched but narrow priors. Forward model mismatch pulls the image samples away from the prior manifold, which causes artifacts but can be mitigated with annealed likelihood schedules that also increase computational efficiency. Overall, we demonstrate that performance gains do not immediately translate from synthetic to experimental data, and future development must validate against real-world benchmarks."}

In this paper, we propose WS-COC, the first MLLM-driven weakly-supervised framework for class-agnostic object counting. Instead of directly fine-tuning MLLMs to predict object counts, which can be challenging due to the modality gap, we incorporate three simple yet effective strategies to bootstrap the counting paradigm in both training and testing: First, a divide-and-discern dialogue tuning strategy is proposed to guide the MLLM to determine whether the object count falls within a specific range and progressively break down the range through multi-round dialogue. Second, a compare-and-rank count optimization strategy is introduced to train the MLLM to optimize the relative ranking of multiple images according to their object counts. Third, a global-and-local counting enhancement strategy aggregates and fuses local and global count predictions to improve counting performance in dense scenes.

To address this limitation, we propose GSM-GS: a synergistic optimization framework integrating single-view adaptive sub-region weighting constraints and multi-view spatial structure refinement. For single-view optimization, we leverage image gradient features to partition scenes into texture-rich and texture-less sub-regions.

Most medical large vision language models (LVLMs) perform visual inspection only once and then rely on text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which operates purely in the linguistic space and is prone to hallucination. Recent methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing visually related coordinates, such as bounding boxes. However, these remain a pseudo-visual solution: coordinates are still text and fail to preserve rich visual details like texture and density. Motivated by the interleaved nature of radiological diagnosis, we introduce MMRad-IVL-22K, the first large-scale dataset designed for natively interleaved visual language reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. MMRad-IVL-22K reflects a repeated cycle of reasoning and visual inspection workflow of radiologists, in which visual rationales complement textual descriptions and ground each step of the reasoning process. MMRad-IVL-22K comprises 21,994 diagnostic traces, enabling systematic scanning across 35 anatomical regions.

However, the lack of an efficient evaluation framework impedes the diagnosis of their performance bottlenecks. Current evaluation primarily relies on testing after supervised fine-tuning, which introduces laborious additional training and autoregressive decoding costs. Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy. Our RADAR underscores the need for a decomposed perspective on pre-training ability bottlenecks, informing targeted interventions to advance MLLMs efficiently.

This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness. It is observed that such training can improve robustness in adverse conditions but may suffer from diminishing returns and forgetting phenomena (i.e., decline in robustness) if overtrained."}

Starting from SDFs and Texture Fields generated by state-of-the-art completion models, our method performs automatic part segmentation, defines user-controlled scaling zones, and applies smooth interpolation of SDFs, color, and part indices to enable proportional and artifact-free deformation. We further incorporate a repetition-based strategy to handle large-scale deformations while preserving repeating geometric patterns. Experiments on Matterport3D and ShapeNet objects show that our method overcomes the inherent rigidity of completed SDFs and is visually more appealing than global and naive selective scaling, particularly for complex shapes and repetitive structures."}

However, the success of existing TWI methods heavily relies on the assumption that interleaved image-text CoTs are faultless, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios due to the complexity of multimodal understanding. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly-practical yet under-explored problem in TWI, termed Noisy Thinking (NT). Specifically, NT refers to the imperfect visual cues mining and answer reasoning process. As the saying goes, ``One mistake leads to another'', erroneous interleaved CoT would cause error accumulation, thus significantly degrading the performance of MLLMs. To solve the NT problem, we propose a novel method dubbed Reliable Thinking with Images (RTWI). In brief, RTWI estimates the reliability of visual cues and textual CoT in a unified text-centric manner and accordingly employs robust filtering and voting modules to prevent NT from contaminating the final answer. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks verify the effectiveness of RTWI against NT."}

EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios. To support semantic-aware and language-integrated VPR research, we provide LLM-generated scene descriptions, subsequently refined through human annotation, establishing a solid foundation for integrating LLMs into event-based perception pipelines. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we implement and benchmark 15 state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on EPRBench, offering a strong baseline for future algorithmic comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm for VPR: leveraging LLMs to generate textual scene descriptions from raw event streams, which then guide spatially attentive token selection, cross-modal feature fusion, and multi-scale representation learning. This framework not only achieves highly accurate place recognition but also produces interpretable reasoning processes alongside its predictions, significantly enhancing model transparency and explainability.

To address this challenge, the Intrapartum Ultrasound Grand Challenge (IUGC), co-hosted with MICCAI 2024, was launched. The IUGC introduces a clinically oriented multi-task automatic measurement framework that integrates standard plane classification, fetal head-pubic symphysis segmentation, and biometry, enabling algorithms to exploit complementary task information for more accurate estimation.

We propose a fully differentiable, deep-learning-based deformable registration framework that aligns individual pathological brains to a common atlas while preserving metastatic tissue without requiring lesion masks or preprocessing.\n  Missing anatomical correspondences caused by metastases are handled through a forward-model similarity metric based on distance-transformed anatomical labels, combined with a volume-preserving regularization term to ensure deformation plausibility. Registration performance was evaluated using Dice coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Jacobian-based measures. The method was applied to 209 MBM patients from three centres, enabling standardized mapping of metastases to anatomical, arterial, and perfusion atlases.\n  The framework achieved high registration accuracy across datasets (DSC 0.89-0.92, HD 6.79-7.60 mm, ASSD 0.63-0.77 mm) while preserving metastatic volumes. Spatial analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of MBM in the cerebral cortex and putamen, under-representation in white matter, and consistent localization near the gray-white matter junction. No arterial territory showed increased metastasis frequency after volume correction.\n  This approach enables robust atlas registration of pathological brain MRI without lesion masks and supports reproducible multi-centre analyses. Applied to MBM, it confirms and refines known spatial predilections, particularly preferential seeding near the gray-white matter junction and cortical regions.

While Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer strong unification potential, existing approaches fail to adapt them into a single end-to-end backbone and lack effective knowledge distillation strategies for edge deployment. To address these limitations, we propose MLLMEmbed-ReID, a unified framework based on a powerful cloud-edge architecture. First, we adapt a foundational MLLM into a state-of-the-art cloud model. We leverage instruction-based prompting to guide the MLLM in generating a unified embedding space across RGB, infrared, sketch, and text modalities. This model is then trained efficiently with a hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation finetuning (LoRA-SFT) strategy, optimized under a holistic cross-modal alignment objective. Second, to deploy its knowledge onto an edge-native student, we introduce a novel distillation strategy motivated by the low-rank property in the teacher's feature space. To prioritize essential information, this method employs a Principal Component Mapping loss, while relational structures are preserved via a Feature Relation loss. Our lightweight edge-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple visual CM-ReID benchmarks, while its cloud-based counterpart excels across all CM-ReID benchmarks. The MLLMEmbed-ReID framework thus presents a complete and effective solution for deploying unified MLLM-level intelligence on resource-constrained devices.

Benefiting from strong semantic modeling and robust generalization, VLM-based end-to-end approaches have emerged as the mainstream paradigm in recent years. However, these models often suffer from substantial inference latency, as they must auto-regressively generate long token sequences when processing long-form documents. In this work, motivated by the extremely long outputs and complex layout structures commonly found in document parsing, we propose a training-free and highly efficient acceleration method. Inspired by speculative decoding, we employ a lightweight document parsing pipeline as a draft model to predict batches of future tokens, while the more accurate VLM verifies these draft predictions in parallel. Moreover, we further exploit the layout-structured nature of documents by partitioning each page into independent regions, enabling parallel decoding of each region using the same draft-verify strategy. The final predictions are then assembled according to the natural reading order. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: on the general-purpose OmniDocBench, our method provides a 2.42x lossless acceleration for the dots.ocr model, and achieves up to 4.89x acceleration on long-document parsing tasks. We will release our code to facilitate reproducibility and future research."}

Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems."}

Building on our previous work, DynaSeg, DynaGuide combines global pseudo-labels from zero-shot models such as DiffSeg or SegFormer with local boundary refinement using a lightweight CNN trained from scratch. This synergy allows the model to correct coarse or noisy global predictions and produce high-precision segmentations.

Such metrics frequently reward visually plausible outputs while overlooking controllability, edit localization, and faithfulness to user instructions. In this work, we introduce a fine-grained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-as-a-Judge framework for image editing that decomposes common evaluation notions into twelve fine-grained interpretable factors spanning image preservation, edit quality, and instruction fidelity. Building on this formulation, we present a new human-validated benchmark that integrates human judgments, MLLM-based evaluations, model outputs, and traditional metrics across diverse image editing tasks. Through extensive human studies, we show that the proposed MLLM judges align closely with human evaluations at a fine granularity, supporting their use as reliable and scalable evaluators. We further demonstrate that traditional image editing metrics are often poor proxies for these factors, failing to distinguish over-edited or semantically imprecise outputs, whereas our judges provide more intuitive and informative assessments in both offline and online settings. Together, this work introduces a benchmark, a principled factorization, and empirical evidence positioning fine-grained MLLM judges as a practical foundation for studying, comparing, and improving image editing approaches."}

Existing dietary assessment methods largely rely on single-image analysis or appearance-based inference, including recent vision-language models, which lack explicit geometric reasoning and are sensitive to scale ambiguity. This benchmark reframes food portion estimation as an implicit-scale 3D reconstruction problem under monocular observations. To reflect real-world conditions, explicit physical references and metric annotations are removed; instead, contextual objects such as plates and utensils are provided, requiring algorithms to infer scale from implicit cues and prior knowledge. The dataset emphasizes multi-food scenes with diverse object geometries, frequent occlusions, and complex spatial arrangements. The benchmark was adopted as a challenge at the MetaFood 2025 Workshop, where multiple teams proposed reconstruction-based solutions. Experimental results show that while strong vision--language baselines achieve competitive performance, geometry-based reconstruction methods provide both improved accuracy and greater robustness, with the top-performing approach achieving 0.21 MAPE in volume estimation and 5.7 L1 Chamfer Distance in geometric accuracy."}

However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

Across three MRI datasets with controlled duplication percentages and typical image augmentations, our metric robustly detects duplication and provides more consistent metric values across datasets. At the sample level, our metric achieves near-perfect detection of duplicates."}

The proposed SIEFormer is composed of two main branches, each corresponding to an implicit and explicit spectral perspective of the ViT, enabling joint optimization. The implicit branch realizes the use of different types of graph Laplacians to model the local structure correlations of tokens, along with a novel Band-adaptive Filter (BaF) layer that can flexibly perform both band-pass and band-reject filtering. The explicit branch, on the other hand, introduces a Maneuverable Filtering Layer (MFL) that learns global dependencies among tokens by applying the Fourier transform to the input ``value\" features, modulating the transformed signal with a set of learnable parameters in the frequency domain, and then performing an inverse Fourier transform to obtain the enhanced features. Extensive experiments reveal state-of-the-art performance on multiple image recognition datasets, reaffirming the superiority of our approach through ablation studies and visualizations."}

Anomaly detection is typically formulated as a one-class classification problem, where the training data consists solely of nominal values, leaving methods built on this assumption susceptible to training label noise. We present a dataset folding method that transforms an arbitrary one-class classifier-based anomaly detector into a fully unsupervised method. This is achieved by making a set of key weak assumptions: that anomalies are uncommon in the training dataset and generally heterogeneous. These assumptions enable us to utilize multiple independently trained instances of a one-class classifier to filter the training dataset for anomalies. This transformation requires no modifications to the underlying anomaly detector; the only changes are algorithmically selected data subsets used for training. We demonstrate that our method can transform a wide variety of one-class classifier anomaly detectors for both images and videos into unsupervised ones. Our method creates the first unsupervised logical anomaly detectors by transforming existing methods. We also demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised anomaly detection on the MVTec AD, ViSA, and MVTec Loco AD datasets. As improvements to one-class classifiers are made, our method directly transfers those improvements to the unsupervised domain, linking the domains."}

However, there are limited studies to further verify privacy risks by reconstructing realistic high-resolution face images from embeddings of these systems, especially for PPFR. In this work, we propose the face embedding mapping (FEM), a general framework that explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for conducting the embedding-to-face attack by leveraging pre-trained Identity-Preserving diffusion model against state-of-the-art (SOTA) FR and PPFR systems. Based on extensive experiments, we verify that reconstructed faces can be used for accessing other real-word FR systems. Besides, the proposed method shows the robustness in reconstructing faces from the partial and protected face embeddings. Moreover, FEM can be utilized as a tool for evaluating safety of FR and PPFR systems in terms of privacy leakage. All images used in this work are from public datasets."}

Existing autoregressive models often fail when processing long sequences. They typically anchor poses to the first frame, which leads to attention decay, scale drift, and extrapolation errors. We introduce LongStream, a novel gauge-decoupled streaming visual geometry model for metric-scale scene reconstruction across thousands of frames. Our approach is threefold. First, we discard the first-frame anchor and predict keyframe-relative poses. This reformulates long-range extrapolation into a constant-difficulty local task. Second, we introduce orthogonal scale learning. This method fully disentangles geometry from scale estimation to suppress drift. Finally, we solve Transformer cache issues such as attention-sink reliance and long-term KV-cache contamination. We propose cache-consistent training combined with periodic cache refresh. This approach suppresses attention degradation over ultra-long sequences and reduces the gap between training and inference. Experiments show LongStream achieves state-of-the-art performance. It delivers stable, metric-scale reconstruction over kilometer-scale sequences at 18 FPS. Project Page: https://3dagentworld.github.io/longstream/"}

Objective assessment and validation of these techniques for specific clinically oriented tasks are crucial for their adoption in clinical motion analysis. AI-driven monocular MMC reduces the barriers to adoption in the clinic and has the potential to reduce the overhead for analysis of this common clinical assessment. Nine adult participants with no impairments performed the standardized UERW task, which entails reaching targets distributed across a virtual sphere centered on the torso, with targets displayed in a VR headset. Movements were simultaneously captured using a marker-based motion capture system and a set of eight FLIR cameras. We performed monocular video analysis on two of these video camera views to compare a frontal and offset camera configurations. The frontal camera orientation demonstrated strong agreement with the marker-based reference, exhibiting a minimal mean bias of $0.61 \\pm 0.12$ \\% reachspace reached per octanct (mean $\\pm$ standard deviation). In contrast, the offset camera view underestimated the percent workspace reached ($-5.66 \\pm 0.45$ \\% reachspace reached). Conclusion: The findings support the feasibility of a frontal monocular camera configuration for UERW assessment, particularly for anterior workspace evaluation where agreement with marker-based motion capture was highest. The overall performance demonstrates clinical potential for practical, single-camera assessments. This study provides the first validation of monocular MMC system for the assessment of the UERW task. By reducing technical complexity, this approach enables broader implementation of quantitative upper extremity mobility assessment."}

We propose FlexAM, a unified framework built upon a novel 3D control signal. This signal represents video dynamics as a point cloud, introducing three key enhancements: multi-frequency positional encoding to distinguish fine-grained motion, depth-aware positional encoding, and a flexible control signal for balancing precision and generative quality. This representation allows FlexAM to effectively disentangle appearance and motion, enabling a wide range of tasks including I2V/V2V editing, camera control, and spatial object editing.

To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to $86\\%$ and token usage by up to $93\\%$ compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on $14$ diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding."}

To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.\nUWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across\ndiverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea\nhabitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including\n15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms\nand underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse\nreasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship\nunderstanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting\nconditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model\nevaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:\ndetailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene\ndescriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,\nand visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater\nenvironments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that\nunderwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for\nimprovement.

These\nmethods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,\n(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned\nmodel. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by\nassigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with\nthe highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp\nlocal minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask\nselection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome\nthis issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed\nScore-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we\nintroduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates\nduring the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the\ncorresponding robust loss.

Alzheimer's\ndisease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape\nanalysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to\nintroduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the\nautomated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted\nMRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models\nwere reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes\nwere computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were\nderived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian\ncurvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was\napplied to these three features to create compact and informative feature\nvectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of\nclassifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:\nStatistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was\nevaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in\ndistinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron\n(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an\naccuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%.

However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the\nnetwork, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of\nthe model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network\nand vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we\ndemonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in\nmodel size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for\nfine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the\nbest trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub."}

Early detection is vital for treatment, yet\nthe lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial\nintelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is\nchallenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are\ncostly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which\nenhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two\nsupervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of\n98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and\na macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly\noutperforming baselines.

Due to the varying granularity of target states across\ndifferent tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and\nheavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which\nlimits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and\nparameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model\ntowards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,\nto extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various\ntask inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify\ndiverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory\nmatching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory\nmechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we\nintroduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any\ngranularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich\nannotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which\nrepresents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified\ntracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++\nsets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different\ngranularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework."}

However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural\ndesigns tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To\naddress this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an\nunderlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask\nconstruction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by\ncapturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.\nTheoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of\ncorrect classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and\nlabel consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective\nattention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a\nhigh level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this\nprinciple across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks\noffer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we\nintroduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with\nMulti-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates\nthree theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert\nrouting mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.\nTo ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme\nthat dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask\nsparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that\nM3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness\nof our unified framework and model design."}

However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often\nhinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale\nvision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification\ncapabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across\ndomains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated\nprompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in\nmulti-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:\n(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by\nlabel-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features\nin images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased\nmappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt\naggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt\nand a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)\nTo maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the\ngenerated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the\ntwo learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.\nTheoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for\nfederated image recognition across multiple domains."}

Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,\nincluding their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to\nmeaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts\neffectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword\ntokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While\neffective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource\nlanguages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating\ncomputation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move\ntoward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images\n(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,\nreusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale\nmultimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or\nsurpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and\nreducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,\nrobustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy.

However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different\nnoise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although\nthis randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider\nperceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR\nperformance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference\nOptimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative\nmodels with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.\nWe construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and\nno-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human\npreference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and\nnatural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the\nstandard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from\noutputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection\nratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,\nwhile larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.\nFurthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively\nweights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group\ndiversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments\nacross both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR\nsignificantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world\nbenchmarks."}

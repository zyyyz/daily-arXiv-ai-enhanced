Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
adverse lighting scenarios.

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over
video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the
referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed
approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video
Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key
contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve
the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the
previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

Abstract: We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for Handwritten
Mathematical Expression (HME) recognition by modeling HMEs as graphs, where
nodes represent symbols and edges capture spatial dependencies. A deep BLSTM
network is used for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation
classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then
generates all possible spatial relations, while the GNN-based link prediction
model refines the structure by removing unnecessary connections, ultimately
forming the Symbol Label Graph. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in HME structure
recognition.

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Portable physiological monitoring is essential for early detection and
management of cardiovascular disease, but current methods often require
specialized equipment that limits accessibility or impose impractical postures
that patients cannot maintain. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones
offers a convenient noninvasive alternative, yet it still faces reliability
challenges caused by motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view
constraints. Few studies have demonstrated reliable application to
cardiovascular patients, and no widely used open datasets exist for
cross-device accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce the M3PD
dataset, the first publicly available dual-view mobile photoplethysmography
dataset, comprising synchronized facial and fingertip videos captured
simultaneously via front and rear smartphone cameras from 60 participants
(including 47 cardiovascular patients). Building on this dual-view setting, we
further propose F3Mamba, which fuses the facial and fingertip views through
Mamba-based temporal modeling. The model reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to
30.2 percent over existing single-view baselines while improving robustness in
challenging real-world scenarios. Data and code:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed
from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified

variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and

current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for

strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for

datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in
tasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to
the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available
datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we
introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k
high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos
covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data
are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding
boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications
such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers
clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data
quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world
scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,
including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and
vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset
to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent
safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire
understanding in the AI community. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing,
involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative,
convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been
manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video
editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often
fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To
address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for
video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching
between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to
obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we
segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such
as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models
to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their
alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization
by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the
assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the
arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,
narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style
of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual
expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience
can create visually compelling videos. Project page:

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated
example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without
compromising computational efficiency. The source code is available at

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,

Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference

have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have
demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks.
Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of
pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer
(PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer
architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model
optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE
embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch
size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are
pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large
multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across
over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains.
Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world
applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.

Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
checkpoint will be made available to the public.

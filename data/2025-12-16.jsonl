However, systems relying on RGB cameras for perception and robotic manipulators for control, common in smart farming, are vulnerable to photometric perturbations such as hue, illumination, and noise changes, which can cause malfunction under adversarial attacks. To address this issue, we propose an explainable adversarial-robust Vision-Language-Action model based on the OpenVLA-OFT framework. The model integrates an Evidence-3 module that detects photometric perturbations and generates natural language explanations of their causes and effects. Experiments show that the proposed model reduces Current Action L1 loss by 21.7% and Next Actions L1 loss by 18.4% compared to the baseline, demonstrating improved action prediction accuracy and explainability under adversarial conditions."}

Anchor-based approaches such as Anchor3DLane have demonstrated strong performance by regressing continuous 3D lane curves from multi-camera surround views. However, the baseline model still exhibits (i) sensitivity to regression outliers, (ii) weak supervision of global curve geometry, (iii) difficulty in balancing multiple loss terms, and (iv) limited exploitation of temporal continuity. We propose Temporal-Anchor3DLane, an enhanced 3D lane detection framework that extends Anchor3DLane with three key contributions: (1) a set of multi-task loss improvements, including Balanced L1 regression, Chamfer point-set distance, and uncertainty-based loss weighting, together with focal and Dice components for classification and visibility; (2) a lightweight Temporal LSTM Fusion module that aggregates per-anchor features across frames, replacing a heavier Transformer-style temporal fusion; and (3) ESCOP-style training refinements that couple curve-level supervision with temporal consistency. On OpenLane, Temporal-Anchor3DLane improves F1 by +6.2 and yields smoother temporal trajectories, showing that small architectural and loss refinements significantly enhance 3D lane robustness without extra sensors or scaling."}

While the broader system contains independent modules for potato, apple, and corn, this study isolates cactus-fig model performance to evaluate attention sensitivity and inductive bias transfer on indigenous morphology alone. Results establish a clear Pareto trade-off: EfficientNet-Lite1 achieves 90.7% test accuracy, the lightweight CNN reaches 89.5% with the most favorable deployment profile (42 ms inference latency, 4.8 MB model size), and MobileViT-XS delivers 97.3% mean cross-validation accuracy, demonstrating that MHSA-based global reasoning disambiguates pest clusters from two dimensional fungal lesions more reliably than local texture CNN kernels.

This work presents a comprehensive comparison between SAM3 (Segment Anything Model, also called SAMv3) operating in zero-shot mode and three variants of Ultralytics YOLO11 (nano, medium, and large) fine-tuned for instance segmentation. The evaluation is conducted on the MinneApple dataset, a dense benchmark comprising 670 orchard images with 28,179 annotated apple instances, enabling rigorous validation of model behavior under high object density and occlusion. Our analysis shows IoU choices can inflate performance gaps by up to 30%. At the appropriate IoU = 0.15 threshold, YOLO models achieve 68.9%, 72.2%, and 71.9% F1, while SAM3 reaches 59.8% in pure zero-shot mode. However, YOLO exhibits steep degradation 48-50 points across IoU ranges whereas SAM3 drops only 4 points, revealing 12 times superior boundary stability of SAM3. This highlights the strength of SAMv3 in mask precision versus specialization in detection completeness of YOLO11. We provide open-source code, evaluation pipelines, and methodological recommendations, contributing to a deeper understanding of when specialized fine-tuned models or generalist foundation models are preferable for dense instance segmentation tasks.

However, mmWave signals are inherently complex, sparse, and high-dimensional, making physical simulation computationally expensive. This paper presents mmWeaver, a novel framework that synthesizes realistic, environment-specific complex mmWave signals by modeling them as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), achieving up to 49-fold compression. mmWeaver incorporates hypernetworks that dynamically generate INR parameters based on environmental context (extracted from RGB-D images) and human motion features (derived from text-to-pose generation via MotionGPT), enabling efficient and adaptive signal synthesis. By conditioning on these semantic and geometric priors, mmWeaver generates diverse I/Q signals at multiple resolutions, preserving phase information critical for downstream tasks such as point cloud estimation and activity classification. Extensive experiments show that mmWeaver achieves a complex SSIM of 0.88 and a PSNR of 35 dB, outperforming existing methods in signal realism while improving activity recognition accuracy by up to 7% and reducing human pose estimation error by up to 15%, all while operating 6-35 times faster than simulation-based approaches."}

Traditional roadside video collection often fails in dense mixed traffic due to occlusion, limited viewing angles, and irregular vehicle movements. UAV-based recording provides a top-down perspective that reduces these issues and captures rich spatial and temporal dynamics. The datasets described here were extracted using the Data from Sky (DFS) platform and validated against manual counts, space mean speeds, and probe trajectories in earlier work. Each dataset contains time-stamped vehicle positions, speeds, longitudinal and lateral accelerations, and vehicle classifications at a resolution of 30 frames per second. Data were collected at six mid-block locations in the national capital region of India, covering diverse traffic compositions and density levels. Exploratory analyses highlight key behavioural patterns, including lane-keeping preferences, speed distributions, and lateral manoeuvres typical of heterogeneous and area-based traffic settings. These datasets are intended as a resource for the global research community to support simulation modelling, safety assessment, and behavioural studies under area-based traffic conditions.

A Unified Benchmark for Typographic-Attack Robustness and Text Recognition in Vision-Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading text within an image overrides visual understanding. Existing evaluation protocols and defenses, largely focused on object recognition, implicitly encourage ignoring text to achieve robustness; however, real-world scenarios often require joint reasoning over both objects and text (e.g., recognizing pedestrians while reading traffic signs). To address this, we introduce a novel task, Read-or-Ignore VQA (RIO-VQA), which formalizes selective text use in visual question answering (VQA): models must decide, from context, when to read text and when to ignore it. For evaluation, we present the Read-or-Ignore Benchmark (RIO-Bench), a standardized dataset and protocol that, for each real image, provides same-scene counterfactuals (read / ignore) by varying only the textual content and question type. Using RIO-Bench, we show that strong LVLMs and existing defenses fail to balance typographic robustness and text-reading capability, highlighting the need for improved approaches. Finally, RIO-Bench enables a novel data-driven defense that learns adaptive selective text use, moving beyond prior non-adaptive, text-ignoring defenses. Overall, this work reveals a fundamental misalignment between the existing evaluation scope and real-world requirements, providing a principled path toward reliable LVLMs. Our Project Page is at https://turingmotors.github.io/rio-vqa/."}

Given a supervised dataset, CLARGA can be applied to virtually any machine learning task to fuse different multimodal representations for processing by downstream layers. On a sample-by-sample basis, CLARGA learns how modalities should inform one another by building an attention weighted graph over their features and passing messages along this graph with a multi-head Graph Attention Network. Not only does this make CLARGA highly adaptive, as it constructs unique graphs for different samples, it makes for efficient fusion with sub-quadratic complexity as the number of modalities grows. Through a learnable mask, it can also adapt to missing modality inputs. The model is trained with a hybrid objective that combines a supervised task loss with contrastive InfoNCE loss, improving cross-modal consistency and robustness to noisy inputs. We demonstrate CLARGA's effectiveness in diverse multimodal representation learning tasks across 7 datasets spanning finance, human-computer interaction, general multimedia classification, and affective computing. It consistently outperforms baselines, state-of-the-art models, and ablations. Additional experiments also demonstrate its robustness to missing inputs and ability to excel on niche tasks.

This has left a gap in our understanding of well-being as it is expressed in everyday life. We hypothesized that candid smiles captured during natural smartphone interactions could serve as a scalable, objective behavioral correlate of positive affect. To test this, we analyzed 405,448 video clips passively recorded from 233 consented participants over one week. Using a deep learning model to quantify smile intensity, we identified distinct diurnal and daily patterns. Daily patterns of smile intensity across the week showed strong correlation with national survey data on happiness (r=0.92), and diurnal rhythms documented close correspondence with established results from the day reconstruction method (r=0.80). Higher daily mean smile intensity was significantly associated with more physical activity (Beta coefficient = 0.043, 95% CI [0.001, 0.085]) and greater light exposure (Beta coefficient = 0.038, [0.013, 0.063]), whereas no significant effects were found for smartphone use. These findings suggest that passive smartphone sensing could serve as a powerful, ecologically valid methodology for studying the dynamics of affective behavior and open the door to understanding this behavior at a population scale."}

Learning-based reconstruction methods require extensive species-specific training data and lack editability. Procedural modeling offers parametric control but demands specialized expertise in geometric modeling and an in-depth understanding of complex procedural rules, making it inaccessible to domain scientists. We present FloraForge, an LLM-assisted framework that enables domain experts to generate biologically accurate, fully parametric 3D plant models through iterative natural language Plant Refinements (PR), minimizing programming expertise. Our framework leverages LLM-enabled co-design to refine Python scripts that generate parameterized plant geometries as hierarchical B-spline surface representations with botanical constraints with explicit control points and parametric deformation functions. This representation can be easily tessellated into polygonal meshes with arbitrary precision, ensuring compatibility with functional structural plant analysis workflows such as light simulation, computational fluid dynamics, and finite element analysis. We demonstrate the framework on maize, soybean, and mung bean, fitting procedural models to empirical point cloud data through manual refinement of the Plant Descriptor (PD), human-readable files. The pipeline generates dual outputs: triangular meshes for visualization and triangular meshes with additional parametric metadata for quantitative analysis. This approach uniquely combines LLM-assisted template creation, mathematically continuous representations enabling both phenotyping and rendering, and direct parametric control through PD. The framework democratizes sophisticated geometric modeling for plant science while maintaining mathematical rigor."}

Specifically, we propose TransBridge, a novel transformer-based up-sampling block that fuses the features from the detection and completion networks.The detection network can benefit from acquiring implicit completion features derived from the completion network. Additionally, we design the Dynamic-Static Reconstruction (DSRecon) module to produce dense LiDAR data for the completion network, meeting the requirement for dense point cloud ground truth.Furthermore, we employ the transformer mechanism to establish connections between channels and spatial relations, resulting in a high-resolution feature map used for completion purposes.Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.The results show that our framework consistently improves end-to-end 3D object detection, with the mean average precision (mAP) ranging from 0.7 to 1.5 across multiple methods, indicating its generalization ability.

We show that model quality improves with scale. The model uses a consistency architecture to generate time-lapse videos, despite the impossibility of obtaining cell paint video training data. In addition, we show that this architecture enables a form of in-context learning, allowing the model to partially transfer to out-of-distribution cell lines and imaging protocols. Virtual cell painting is not intended to replace physical cell painting completely, but to act as a complementary tool enabling novel workflows in biological research."}

Related Bayesian segmentation methods can compete with hidden Markov fields (HMFs)-based ones and are much faster. PS has recently been extended to the contextual PS, and some initial experiments have shown the value of the associated HMC model, denoted as HMC-CPS, in image segmentation. Moreover, HMCs have been extended to hidden evidential Markov chains (HEMCs), which are capable of improving HMC-based Bayesian segmentation. In this study, we introduce a new HEMC-CPS model by simultaneously considering contextual PS and evidential HMC. We show its effectiveness for Bayesian maximum posterior mode (MPM) segmentation using synthetic and real images. Segmentation is performed in an unsupervised manner, with parameters being estimated using the stochastic expectation--maximization (SEM) method. The new HEMC-CPS model presents potential for the modeling and segmentation of more complex images, such as three-dimensional or multi-sensor multi-resolution images.

This coarse-grained alignment fails to bridge the domain shift between seen and unseen classes, thereby impeding the effective transfer of fine-grained visual knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{DynaPURLS}, a unified framework that establishes robust, multi-scale visual-semantic correspondences and dynamically refines them at inference time to enhance generalization. Our framework leverages a large language model to generate hierarchical textual descriptions that encompass both global movements and local body-part dynamics. Concurrently, an adaptive partitioning module produces fine-grained visual representations by semantically grouping skeleton joints. To fortify this fine-grained alignment against the train-test domain shift, DynaPURLS incorporates a dynamic refinement module. During inference, this module adapts textual features to the incoming visual stream via a lightweight learnable projection. This refinement process is stabilized by a confidence-aware, class-balanced memory bank, which mitigates error propagation from noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments on three large-scale benchmark datasets, including NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD, demonstrate that DynaPURLS significantly outperforms prior art, setting new state-of-the-art records.

Previous methods simplify the setup by assuming ground truth object template or constraining to a limited set of object categories. We present CARI4D, the first category-agnostic method that reconstructs spatially and temporarily consistent 4D human-object interaction at metric scale from monocular RGB videos. To this end, we propose a pose hypothesis selection algorithm that robustly integrates the individual predictions from foundation models, jointly refine them through a learned render-and-compare paradigm to ensure spatial, temporal and pixel alignment, and finally reasoning about intricate contacts for further refinement satisfying physical constraints. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior art by 38% on in-distribution dataset and 36% on unseen dataset in terms of reconstruction error.

V-REX covers rich application scenarios across diverse domains. V-REX casts the multi-step exploratory reasoning into a Chain-of-Questions (CoQ) and disentangles VLMs' capability to (1) Planning: breaking down an open-ended task by selecting a chain of exploratory questions; and (2) Following: answering curated CoQ sequentially to collect information for deriving the final answer. By curating finite options of questions and answers per step, V-REX achieves a reliable quantitative and fine-grained analysis of the intermediate steps. By assessing SOTA proprietary and open-sourced VLMs, we reveal consistent scaling trends, significant differences between planning and following abilities, and substantial room for improvement in multi-step exploratory reasoning."}

While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a \"System 2\" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model \"Judge-Scout\" consensus mechanism.

In this work, we proposed a graph representation with a discrete dynamic graph neural network (DDGNN) to explore the spatial-temporal representation of human movement-related features. Specifically, we designed a star graph to describe the high-dimensional relative relationship between a manually added static center point and the dynamic mmWave radar points in the same and consecutive frames.

It targets SPOT-6/7 imagery due to its very high resolution and on-demand availability. Experiments are evaluated based on Dice score, Intersection over Union, and inference time.

Such severe structural artifacts also appear in very low-quality real-world videos. Classical video restoration and super-resolution (VR/VSR) methods, in contrast, are tuned for synthetic degradations such as blur and downsampling and tend to stabilize these artifacts rather than repair them, while diffusion-prior restorers are usually trained on photometric noise and offer little control over the trade-off between perceptual quality and fidelity.\n  We introduce CreativeVR, a diffusion-prior-guided video restoration framework for AI-generated (AIGC) and real videos with severe structural and temporal artifacts. Our deep-adapter-based method exposes a single precision knob that controls how strongly the model follows the input, smoothly trading off between precise restoration on standard degradations and stronger structure- and motion-corrective behavior on challenging content. Our key novelty is a temporally coherent degradation module used during training, which applies carefully designed transformations that produce realistic structural failures.\n  To evaluate AIGC-artifact restoration, we propose the AIGC54 benchmark with FIQA, semantic and perceptual metrics, and multi-aspect scoring. CreativeVR achieves state-of-the-art results on videos with severe artifacts and performs competitively on standard video restoration benchmarks, while running at practical throughput (about 13 FPS at 720p on a single 80-GB A100).

Unlike prior approaches that rely on few-step distillation and distribution-matching losses, which can hurt quality and diversity, BAgger trains with standard score or flow matching objectives, avoiding large teachers and long-chain backpropagation through time.

These approaches inject the rich semantics from high-dimensional VFM representations (e.g., DINOv3) into LDMs at different phases, resulting in accelerated learning and better generation performance. However, the high-dimensionality of VFM representations may also lead to Information Overload, particularly when the VFM features exceed the size of the original image for decoding. To address this issue while preserving the utility of VFM features, we propose RePack (Representation Packing), a simple yet effective framework for improving Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). RePack transforms the VFM representation into a more compact, decoder-friendly representation by projecting onto low-dimensional manifolds. We find that RePack can effectively filter out non-semantic noise while preserving the core structural information needed for high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results show that RePack significantly accelerates DiT convergence and outperforms recent methods that directly inject raw VFM features into the decoder for image reconstruction. On DiT-XL/2, RePack achieves an FID of 3.66 in only 64 epochs, which is 35% faster than the state-of-the-art method. This demonstrates that RePack successfully extracts the core semantics of VFM representations while bypassing their high-dimensionality side effects."}

However, they often produce outputs that are linguistically fluent but factually inconsistent with the visual evidence, i.e., they hallucinate. Despite growing efforts to mitigate such hallucinations, a key question remains: what form of visual attention can effectively suppress hallucinations during decoding? In this work, we provide a simple answer: the vision encoder's own attention map. We show that LVLMs tend to hallucinate when their final visual-attention maps fail to concentrate on key image objects, whereas the vision encoder's more concentrated attention maps substantially reduce hallucinations. To further investigate the cause, we analyze vision-text conflicts during decoding and find that these conflicts peak in the language model's middle layers. Injecting the vision encoder's attention maps into these layers effectively suppresses hallucinations. Building on these insights, we introduce VEGAS, a simple yet effective inference-time method that integrates the vision encoder's attention maps into the language model's mid-layers and adaptively steers tokens which fail to concentrate on key image objects. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VEGAS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations."}

Existing video watermarking methods based on both post-hoc and in-generation approaches fail to simultaneously achieve imperceptibility, robustness, and computational efficiency. This work introduces a novel framework for in-generation video watermarking called SPDMark (pronounced `SpeedMark') based on selective parameter displacement of a video diffusion model. Watermarks are embedded into the generated videos by modifying a subset of parameters in the generative model. To make the problem tractable, the displacement is modeled as an additive composition of layer-wise basis shifts, where the final composition is indexed by the watermarking key. For parameter efficiency, this work specifically leverages low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to implement the basis shifts. During the training phase, the basis shifts and the watermark extractor are jointly learned by minimizing a combination of message recovery, perceptual similarity, and temporal consistency losses. To detect and localize temporal modifications in the watermarked videos, we use a cryptographic hashing function to derive frame-specific watermark messages from the given base watermarking key. During watermark extraction, maximum bipartite matching is applied to recover the correct frame order, even from temporally tampered videos. Evaluations on both text-to-video and image-to-video generation models demonstrate the ability of SPDMark to generate imperceptible watermarks that can be recovered with high accuracy and also establish its robustness against a variety of common video modifications."}

Visually recognizing pollen in unreconstructed holographic images remains challenging due to speckle noise, twin-image artifacts and substantial divergence from bright-field appearances. We establish the performance baseline by training YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for classification on a dual-modality dataset of automatically annotated optical and affinely aligned DIHM images. On optical data, detection mAP50 reaches 91.3% and classification accuracy reaches 97%, whereas on DIHM data, we achieve only 8.15% for detection mAP50 and 50% for classification accuracy. Expanding the bounding boxes of pollens in DIHM images over those acquired in aligned optical images achieves 13.3% for detection mAP50 and 54% for classification accuracy. To improve object detection in DIHM images, we employ a Wasserstein GAN with spectral normalization (WGAN-SN) to create synthetic DIHM images, yielding an FID score of 58.246. Mixing real-world and synthetic data at the 1.0 : 1.5 ratio for DIHM images improves object detection up to 15.4%.

We introduce EchoGround-MIMIC, the first measurement-grounded multimodal echocardiography dataset, comprising 19,065 image-text pairs from 1,572 patients with standardized views, structured measurements, measurement-grounded captions, and guideline-derived disease labels.

Across five types of clinical applications with 36 tasks spanning multimodal disease classification, image-text retrieval, view classification, chamber segmentation, and landmark detection, EchoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance (86.5% AUC in zero-shot disease classification and 95.1% accuracy in view classification).

Incorporating robust feature engineering approach can highly improve the performance of these models. Topological data analysis (TDA), a recent development based on the mathematical field of algebraic topology, mainly focuses on the data from a topological perspective, extracting deeper insight and higher dimensional structures from the data. Persistent homology (PH), a fundamental tool in the area of TDA, can extract topological features such as connected components, cycles and voids from the data. A popular approach to construct PH from 3D CT images is to utilize the 3D cubical complex filtration, a method adapted for grid-structured data. However, this approach may not always yield the best performance and can suffer from computational complexity with higher resolution CT images. This study introduces a novel patch-based PH construction approach tailored for volumetric medical imaging data, in particular CT modality. A wide range of experiments has been conducted on several datasets of 3D CT images to comprehensively analyze the performance of the proposed method with various parameters and benchmark it against the 3D cubical complex algorithm. Our results highlight the dominance of the patch-based TDA approach in terms of both classification performance and time-efficiency.

While prior disaster road damage assessment datasets exist, there is no current state of practice, as prior public datasets have either been small-scale or reliant on low-resolution imagery insufficient for detecting phenomena of interest to emergency managers. Further, while machine learning (ML) systems have been developed for this task previously, none are known to have been operationally validated. These limitations are overcome in this work through the labeling of 657.25km of roads according to a 10-class labeling schema, followed by training and deploying ML models during the operational response to Hurricanes Debby and Helene in 2024. Motivated by observed road line misalignment in practice, 9,184 road line adjustments were provided for spatial alignment of a priori road lines, as it was found that when the 18 baseline models are deployed against real-world misaligned road lines, model performance degraded on average by 5.596\\% Macro IoU.

We develop a deep learning model that creates gridded surface meltwater maps at daily 100m resolution by fusing data streams from remote sensing observations and physics-based models. In particular, we spatiotemporally downscale regional climate model (RCM) outputs using synthetic aperture radar (SAR), passive microwave (PMW), and a digital elevation model (DEM) over the Helheim Glacier in Eastern Greenland from 2017-2023.

These representations are aligned with the model during the LoRA fine-tuning process. Our approach is structured in three core stages: (1) We exploit subject representations via a self-supervised encoder to guide subject alignment, enabling the model to capture overall structure of subject and enhance high-level semantic consistency. (2) We utilize motion representations from an optical flow encoder to capture structurally coherent and object-level motion trajectories independent of appearance. (3) We propose a subject-motion association decoupling strategy that applies sparse LoRAs injection across both locations and timing, effectively reducing interference between subject and motion LoRAs. Extensive experiments show that SMRABooth excels in subject and motion customization, maintaining consistent subject appearance and motion patterns, proving its effectiveness in controllable text-to-video generation."}

To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.\n  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.\n  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment."}

The dataset comprises of around 50,000 facial frames extracted from video recordings of 15 children with ASD. A hybrid model combining a fine-tuned ResNet-50-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a three-layer Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) trained on both visual and geometric features extracted from MediaPipe FaceMesh landmarks.

We introduce the visual faithfulness of reasoning chains as a distinct evaluation dimension, focusing on whether the perception steps of a reasoning chain are grounded in the image. We propose a training- and reference-free framework that decomposes chains into perception versus reasoning steps and uses off-the-shelf VLM judges for step-level faithfulness, additionally verifying this approach through a human meta-evaluation. Building on this metric, we present a lightweight self-reflection procedure that detects and locally regenerates unfaithful perception steps without any training.

This is typically achieved by transferring visual-attribute relationships from seen classes to unseen classes. The core challenge is attribute entanglement, where conventional models collapse distinct attributes like color, shape, and texture into a single visual embedding. This causes interference that masks these critical distinctions. The post-hoc solutions of previous work are insufficient, as they operate on representations that are already mixed. We propose a zero-shot learning framework that learns AttributeCentric Representations (ACR) to tackle this problem by imposing attribute disentanglement during representation learning. ACR is achieved with two mixture-of-experts components, including Mixture of Patch Experts (MoPE) and Mixture of Attribute Experts (MoAE). First, MoPE is inserted into the transformer using a dual-level routing mechanism to conditionally dispatch image patches to specialized experts. This ensures coherent attribute families are processed by dedicated experts. Finally, the MoAE head projects these expert-refined features into sparse, partaware attribute maps for robust zero-shot classification. On zero-shot learning benchmark datasets CUB, AwA2, and SUN, our ACR achieves consistent state-of-the-art results."}

For 654 figures collected from real textbooks and technical reports, we construct detailed image instructions and a hierarchy of rubrics that decompose correctness into 6,076 criteria and 44,131 binary checks. Rubrics are derived from surrounding text and reference figures using large multimodal models, and are evaluated by an automated LMM-based judge with a principled penalty scheme that aggregates sub-question outcomes into interpretable criterion scores. We benchmark several representative text-to-image models on ProImage-Bench and find that, despite strong open-domain performance, the best base model reaches only 0.791 rubric accuracy and 0.553 criterion score overall, revealing substantial gaps in fine-grained scientific fidelity. Finally, we show that the same rubrics provide actionable supervision: feeding failed checks back into an editing model for iterative refinement boosts a strong generator from 0.653 to 0.865 in rubric accuracy and from 0.388 to 0.697 in criterion score. ProImage-Bench thus offers both a rigorous diagnostic for professional image generation and a scalable signal for improving specification-faithful scientific illustrations."}

However, ongoing myelination and reduced tissue contrast make automated segmentation particularly challenging. This study systematically compared segmentation accuracy and its impact on volumetric and fractal dimension (FD) estimates in infant brain MRI using the Baby Open Brains (BOB) dataset (71 scans, 1-9 months). Two methods, SynthSeg and SamSeg, were evaluated against expert annotations using Dice, Intersection over Union, 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance, and Normalised Mutual Information. SynthSeg outperformed SamSeg across all quality metrics (mean Dice > 0.8 for major regions) and provided volumetric estimates closely matching the manual reference (mean +4% [-28% - 71%]). SamSeg systematically overestimated ventricular and whole-brain volumes (mean +76% [-12% - 190%]). Segmentation accuracy improved with age, consistent with increasing tissue contrast during myelination. Fractal dimension a(FD) nalyses revealed significant regional differences between SynthSeg and expert segmentations, and Bland-Altman limits of agreement indicated that segmentation-related FD variability exceeded most group differences reported in developmental cohorts. Volume and FD deviations were positively correlated across structures, indicating that segmentation bias directly affects FD estimation. Overall, SynthSeg provided the most reliable volumetric and FD results for paediatric MRI, yet small morphological differences in volume and FD should be interpreted with caution due to segmentation-related uncertainty."}

Existing frameworks typically rely on large pretrained encoders (e.g., VAEs or tokenizer-based models) and perform transform coding within their generative latent space. While these approaches achieve impressive perceptual fidelity, their reliance on heavy encoder networks makes them unsuitable for deployment on weak sender devices. In this work, we explore the feasibility of applying shallow encoders for ultra-low bitrate compression and propose a novel Asymmetric Extreme Image Compression (AEIC) framework that pursues simultaneously encoding simplicity and decoding quality. Specifically, AEIC employs moderate or even shallow encoder networks, while leveraging an one-step diffusion decoder to maintain high-fidelity and high-realism reconstructions under extreme bitrates. To further enhance the efficiency of shallow encoders, we design a dual-side feature distillation scheme that transfers knowledge from AEIC with moderate encoders to its shallow encoder variants. Experiments demonstrate that AEIC not only outperforms existing methods on rate-distortion-perception performance at ultra-low bitrates, but also delivers exceptional encoding efficiency for 35.8 FPS on 1080P input images, while maintaining competitive decoding speed compared to existing methods."}

Other works use generative Multimodal LLM (MLLM) to predict moments and/or highlights as text timestamps, utilizing its reasoning capability. While effective, text-based generation cannot provide direct gradients for frame-level predictions because the model only emits language tokens. Although recent Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods attempt to address the issue, we propose a novel approach by applying segmentation objectives directly on the LLM's output tokens. The LLM is fed with a fixed number of frames alongside a prompt that enforces it to output a sequence of continuous \"0\" and/or \"1\" characters, with one character per frame. The \"0\"/\"1\" characters benefit from the LLM's inherent language capability while also acting as background and foreground probabilities, respectively. Training employs segmentation losses on the probabilities alongside a normal causal LM loss. At inference, beam search generates sequence and logits, acting as moments and saliency scores, respectively. Despite sampling only 25 frames -- less than half of comparable methods -- our method achieved strong highlight detection (56.74 HIT@1) on QVHighlights. Additionally, our efficient method scores above the baseline (35.28 MAP) for moment retrieval. Empirically, segmentation losses provide a stable complementary learning signal even when the causal LM loss plateaus."}

The auxiliary task dynamically learns parameterized augmentations for each sample, enabling more expressive transformations that capture essential features in target domains. MetaTPT adopts a dual-loop optimization paradigm: an inner loop learns a self-supervised task that generates informative views, while the outer loop performs prompt tuning by enforcing consistency across these views. By coupling augmentation learning with prompt tuning, MetaTPT improves test-time adaptation under domain shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaTPT achieves state-of-the-art performance on domain generalization and cross-dataset benchmarks."}

In this work, we propose a hybrid framework for FER in a continual learning setting that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Our approach integrates two complementary modalities: deep convolutional features and facial Action Units (AUs) derived from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The combined representation is modelled through Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMMs), which provide a lightweight, probabilistic solution that avoids retraining while offering strong discriminative power. Using the Compound Facial Expression of Emotion (CFEE) dataset, we show that our model can first learn basic expressions and then progressively recognize compound expressions.

To address this gap, we propose Cognitive-YOLO, a novel framework for LLM-driven architecture synthesis that generates network configurations directly from the intrinsic characteristics of the dataset. Our method consists of three stages: first, an analysis module extracts key meta-features (e.g., object scale distribution and scene density) from the target dataset; second, the LLM reasons upon these features, augmented with state-of-the-art components retrieved via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to synthesize the architecture into a structured Neural Architecture Description Language (NADL); finally, a compiler instantiates this description into a deployable model. Extensive experiments on five diverse object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed Cognitive-YOLO consistently generates superior architectures, achieving highly competitive performance and demonstrating a superior performance-per-parameter trade-off compared to strong baseline models across multiple benchmarks. Crucially, our ablation studies prove that the LLM's data-driven reasoning is the primary driver of performance, demonstrating that a deep understanding of data \"first principles\" is more critical for achieving a superior architecture than simply retrieving SOTA components."}

However, existing UDA methods still struggle to bridge the domain gap due to cross-domain contextual ambiguity, inconsistent feature representations, and class-wise pseudo-label noise. To address these challenges, we propose Omni-level Masking for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OMUDA), a unified framework that introduces hierarchical masking strategies across distinct representation levels. Specifically, OMUDA comprises: 1) a Context-Aware Masking (CAM) strategy that adaptively distinguishes foreground from background to balance global context and local details; 2) a Feature Distillation Masking (FDM) strategy that enhances robust and consistent feature learning through knowledge transfer from pre-trained models; and 3) a Class Decoupling Masking (CDM) strategy that mitigates the impact of noisy pseudo-labels by explicitly modeling class-wise uncertainty. This hierarchical masking paradigm effectively reduces the domain shift at the contextual, representational, and categorical levels, providing a unified solution beyond existing approaches. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging cross-domain semantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness of OMUDA. Notably, on the SYNTHIA->Cityscapes and GTA5->Cityscapes tasks, OMUDA can be seamlessly integrated into existing UDA methods and consistently achieving state-of-the-art results with an average improvement of 7%."}

Supplementary material and code will be provided at the end of January", "summary": "While deep learning methods have achieved impressive success in many vision benchmarks, it remains difficult to understand and explain the representations and decisions of these models. Though vision models are typically trained on 2D inputs, they are often assumed to develop an implicit representation of the underlying 3D scene (for example, showing tolerance to partial occlusion, or the ability to reason about relative depth). Here, we introduce MRD (metamers rendered differentiably), an approach that uses physically based differentiable rendering to probe vision models' implicit understanding of generative 3D scene properties, by finding 3D scene parameters that are physically different but produce the same model activation (i.e. are model metamers). Unlike previous pixel-based methods for evaluating model representations, these reconstruction results are always grounded in physical scene descriptions. This means we can, for example, probe a model's sensitivity to object shape while holding material and lighting constant. As a proof-of-principle, we assess multiple models in their ability to recover scene parameters of geometry (shape) and bidirectional reflectance distribution function (material). The results show high similarity in model activation between target and optimized scenes, with varying visual results. Qualitatively, these reconstructions help investigate the physical scene attributes to which models are sensitive or invariant. MRD holds promise for advancing our understanding of both computer and human vision by enabling analysis of how physical scene parameters drive changes in model responses."}

WeDetect is a real-time detector with a dual-tower architecture. We show that, with well-curated data and full training, the non-fusion WeDetect surpasses other fusion models and establishes a strong open-vocabulary foundation.

Broadly, inference-time training-free approaches for aligning diffusion models can be categorized into two main strategies: sampling-based methods, which explore multiple candidate outputs and select those with higher reward signals, and gradient-guided methods, which use differentiable reward approximations to directly steer the generation process. In this work, we propose a universal algorithm, UniCoDe, which brings together the strengths of sampling and gradient-based guidance into a unified framework. UniCoDe integrates local gradient signals during sampling, thereby addressing the sampling inefficiency inherent in complex reward-based sampling approaches. By cohesively combining these two paradigms, UniCoDe enables more efficient sampling while offering better trade-offs between reward alignment and divergence from the diffusion unconditional prior. Empirical results demonstrate that UniCoDe remains competitive with state-of-the-art baselines across a range of tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/maurya-goyal10/UniCoDe"}

TCLeaf-Net is designed to tackle three major challenges. To mitigate interference from complex backgrounds, the transformer-convolution module (TCM) couples global context with locality-preserving convolution to suppress non-leaf regions. To reduce information loss during downsampling, the raw-scale feature recalling and sampling (RSFRS) block combines bilinear resampling and convolution to preserve fine spatial detail. To handle variations in lesion scale and feature shifts, the deformable alignment block with FPN (DFPN) employs offset-based alignment and multi-receptive-field perception to strengthen multi-scale fusion. Experimental results show that on the in-field split of the Daylily-Leaf dataset, TCLeaf-Net improves mAP@50 by 5.4 percentage points over the baseline model, reaching 78.2\\%, while reducing computation by 7.5 GFLOPs and GPU memory usage by 8.7\\%.

Instead of static, exhaustive preprocessing, VideoARM performs adaptive, on-the-fly agentic reasoning and memory construction. Specifically, VideoARM performs an adaptive and continuous loop of observing, thinking, acting, and memorizing, where a controller autonomously invokes tools to interpret the video in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby substantially reducing token consumption. In parallel, a hierarchical multimodal memory continuously captures and updates multi-level clues throughout the operation of the agent, providing precise contextual information to support the controller in decision-making.

(1) A lightweight coarse appearance adaptation stage leverages only a small set of reference images, which are already required for the task. This step encodes global subject identity through image-only LoRA and subject-embedding adaptation. (2) A inference-time fine appearance injection stage refines visual fidelity by computing semantic correspondences from RoPE-free mid-layer query--key features. These correspondences guide the warping of appearance-rich value representations into semantically aligned regions of the generation process, with masking ensuring spatial reliability. V-Warper significantly improves appearance fidelity while preserving prompt alignment and motion dynamics, and it achieves these gains efficiently without large-scale video finetuning."}

This paper proposes a Graph Attention Network (GAT)-based framework that reconstructs these missing vertical channels using only the current LiDAR frame, with no camera images or temporal information required. Each LiDAR sweep is represented as an unstructured spatial graph: points are nodes and edges connect nearby points while preserving the original beam-index ordering. A multi-layer GAT learns adaptive attention weights over local geometric neighborhoods and directly regresses the missing elevation (z) values at dropout locations. Trained and evaluated on 1,065 raw KITTI sequences with simulated channel dropout, the method achieves an average height RMSE of 11.67 cm, with 87.98% of reconstructed points falling within a 10 cm error threshold. Inference takes 14.65 seconds per frame on a single GPU, and reconstruction quality remains stable for different neighborhood sizes k.

We introduce BokehDepth, a two-stage framework that decouples bokeh synthesis from depth prediction and treats defocus as an auxiliary supervision-free geometric cue. In Stage-1, a physically guided controllable bokeh generator, built on a powerful pretrained image editing backbone, produces depth-free bokeh stacks with calibrated bokeh strength from a single sharp input. In Stage-2, a lightweight defocus-aware aggregation module plugs into existing monocular depth encoders, fuses features along the defocus dimension, and exposes stable depth-sensitive variations while leaving downstream decoder unchanged. Across challenging benchmarks, BokehDepth improves visual fidelity over depth-map-based bokeh baselines and consistently boosts the metric accuracy and robustness of strong monocular depth foundation models."}

Photon mapping provides physically grounded estimates of complex global illumination effects such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, yet its per-view radiance estimation remains computationally inefficient when rendering multiple views of the same scene. The inefficiency arises from independent photon tracing and stochastic kernel estimation at each viewpoint, leading to inevitable redundant computation. To accelerate multi-view rendering, we reformulate photon mapping as a continuous and reusable radiance function. Specifically, we introduce the Gaussian Photon Field (GPF), a learnable representation that encodes photon distributions as anisotropic 3D Gaussian primitives parameterized by position, rotation, scale, and spectrum. GPF is initialized from physically traced photons in the first SPPM iteration and optimized using multi-view supervision of final radiance, distilling photon-based light transport into a continuous field. Once trained, the field enables differentiable radiance evaluation along camera rays without repeated photon tracing or iterative refinement. Extensive experiments on scenes with complex light transport, such as caustics and specular-diffuse interactions, demonstrate that GPF attains photon-level accuracy while reducing computation by orders of magnitude, unifying the physical rigor of photon-based rendering with the efficiency of neural scene representations."}

Recent cache-based adaptation approaches (e.g., Tip-Adapter) address this challenge to some extent by learning lightweight residual adapters over frozen features, yet they still inherit CLIP's tendency to encode global, general-purpose representations that are not optimally discriminative to adapt the generalist to the specialist's domain in low-data regimes. We address this limitation with a novel patch-driven relational refinement that learns cache adapter weights from intra-image patch dependencies rather than treating an image embedding as a monolithic vector. Specifically, we introduce a relational gated graph attention network that constructs a patch graph and performs edge-aware attention to emphasize informative inter-patch interactions, producing context-enriched patch embeddings. A learnable multi-aggregation pooling then composes these into compact, task-discriminative representations that better align cache keys with the target few-shot classes. Crucially, the proposed graph refinement is used only during training to distil relational structure into the cache, incurring no additional inference cost beyond standard cache lookup. Final predictions are obtained by a residual fusion of cache similarity scores with CLIP zero-shot logits. Extensive evaluations on 11 benchmarks show consistent gains over state-of-the-art CLIP adapter and cache-based baselines while preserving zero-shot efficiency. We further validate battlefield relevance by introducing an Injured vs. Uninjured Soldier dataset for casualty recognition.

However, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to this domain is challenging due to the large number of video frames, resulting in high GPU memory usage and computational latency. To address these challenges, we propose token pruning as a means to reduce context length while retaining critical information. Specifically, we introduce a novel redundancy metric, Maximum Similarity to Spatially Adjacent Video Tokens (MSSAVT), which accounts for both token similarity and spatial position. To mitigate the bidirectional dependency between pruning and redundancy, we further design a masked pruning strategy that ensures only mutually unadjacent tokens are pruned. We also integrate an existing temporal redundancy-based pruning method to eliminate temporal redundancy of the video modality. Experimental results on multiple online and offline video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the accuracy (i.e., by 4\\% at most) while incurring a negligible pruning latency (i.e., less than 1ms). Our full implementation will be made publicly available."}

At inference, MVP acquires a library of physical views per scene, selects the top-k sensor settings using a source-affinity score, evaluates each retained view under lightweight digital augmentations, filters the lowest-entropy subset of augmented views, and aggregates predictions with Zero-temperature softmax (i.e., hard voting). This selection-then-vote design is simple, calibration-friendly, and requires no gradients or model modifications. On ImageNet-ES and ImageNet-ES-Diverse, MVP consistently outperforms digital-only TTA on single Auto-Exposure captures, by up to 25.6 percentage points (pp), and delivers up to 3.4 pp additional gains over pipelines that combine conventional sensor control with TTA. MVP remains effective under reduced parameter candidate sets that lower capture latency, demonstrating practicality. These results support the main claim that, beyond post-capture prompting, measurement-time control--selecting and combining real physical views--substantially improves robustness for VLMs."}

This is the extended version of the paper accepted at AAAI 2026, including related works and appendix", "summary": "Despite the rapid progress of deep learning in video action recognition (VAR) in recent years, privacy leakage in videos remains a critical concern. Current state-of-the-art privacy-preserving methods often rely on anonymization. These methods suffer from (1) low concealment, where producing visually distorted videos that attract attackers' attention during transmission, and (2) spatiotemporal disruption, where degrading essential spatiotemporal features for accurate VAR. To address these issues, we propose StegaVAR, a novel framework that embeds action videos into ordinary cover videos and directly performs VAR in the steganographic domain for the first time. Throughout both data transmission and action analysis, the spatiotemporal information of hidden secret video remains complete, while the natural appearance of cover videos ensures the concealment of transmission. Considering the difficulty of steganographic domain analysis, we propose Secret Spatio-Temporal Promotion (STeP) and Cross-Band Difference Attention (CroDA) for analysis within the steganographic domain. STeP uses the secret video to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction in the steganographic domain during training. CroDA suppresses cover interference by capturing cross-band semantic differences. Experiments demonstrate that StegaVAR achieves superior VAR and privacy-preserving performance on widely used datasets. Moreover, our framework is effective for multiple steganographic models."}

Conventional advertisement layout techniques have predominantly relied on saliency mapping to detect salient regions within a background image, but such approaches often fail to fully account for the image's detailed composition and semantic content. To overcome this limitation, our method harnesses a VLM to recognize the products and other elements depicted in the background and to inform the placement of text and logos. The proposed layout-generation pipeline consists of two steps. In the first step, the VLM analyzes the image to identify object types and their spatial relationships, then produces a text-based \"placement plan\" based on this analysis. In the second step, that plan is rendered into the final layout by generating HTML-format code. We validated the effectiveness of our approach through evaluation experiments, conducting both quantitative and qualitative comparisons against existing methods. The results demonstrate that by explicitly considering the background image's content, our method produces noticeably higher-quality advertisement layouts."}

Existing methods struggle to balance scene preservation with prompt adherence: they either replicate the scene with high fidelity but poor responsiveness to the prompt, or prioritize prompt compliance at the expense of scene consistency. To resolve this trade-off, we introduce two key contributions: (i) a scene-consistent data construction pipeline that generates diverse, geometrically-grounded training pairs, and (ii) a novel geometry-guided attention loss that leverages cross-view cues to regularize the model's spatial reasoning. Experiments on our scene-consistent benchmark show that our approach achieves better scene alignment and text-image consistency than state-of-the-art baselines, according to both automatic metrics and human preference studies.

Feature caching is effective since adjacent timesteps yield highly similar features. However, an inherent trade-off remains: aggressive timestep reuse offers large speedups but can easily cross the critical line, hurting fidelity, while block- or token-level reuse is safer but yields limited computational savings. We present X-Slim (eXtreme-Slimming Caching), a training-free, cache-based accelerator that, to our knowledge, is the first unified framework to exploit cacheable redundancy across timesteps, structure (blocks), and space (tokens). Rather than simply mixing levels, X-Slim introduces a dual-threshold controller that turns caching into a push-then-polish process: it first pushes reuse at the timestep level up to an early-warning line, then switches to lightweight block- and token-level refresh to polish the remaining redundancy, and triggers full inference once the critical line is crossed to reset accumulated error. At each level, context-aware indicators decide when and where to cache. Across diverse tasks, X-Slim advances the speed-quality frontier. On FLUX.1-dev and HunyuanVideo, it reduces latency by up to 4.97x and 3.52x with minimal perceptual loss. On DiT-XL/2, it reaches 3.13x acceleration and improves FID by 2.42 over prior methods."}

Patchify divides each database image into a small number of structured patches and performs retrieval by comparing these local features with a global query descriptor, enabling accurate and spatially grounded matching. To assess not just retrieval accuracy but also spatial correctness, we introduce LocScore, a localization-aware metric that quantifies whether the retrieved region aligns with the target object. This makes LocScore a valuable diagnostic tool for understanding and improving retrieval behavior. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks, backbones, and region selection strategies, showing that Patchify outperforms global methods and complements state-of-the-art reranking pipelines.

Our model introduces two key innovations: 1) A Dynamic 3D Chain-of-Thought (3D CoT) that unifies planning, grounding, navigation, and question answering within a single 3D-VLM and CoT pipeline; 2) A Synergistic Learning from Fragmented Supervision (SLFS) strategy, which uses a masked autoregressive loss to learn from massive and partially-annotated hybrid data. This allows different CoT components to mutually reinforce and implicitly supervise each other. To this end, we construct a large-scale dataset with 10M hybrid samples from 5K real scans and 20K synthetic scenes that are compatible with online learning methods such as RL and DAgger.

However, these methods remain dependent on explicit step-by-step reasoning, unstable perception-reasoning interaction and notable computational overhead. Inspired by human cognition, we posit that thinking unfolds not linearly but through the dynamic interleaving of reasoning and perception within the mind. Motivated by this perspective, we propose DMLR, a test-time Dynamic Multimodal Latent Reasoning framework that employs confidence-guided latent policy gradient optimization to refine latent think tokens for in-depth reasoning. Furthermore, a Dynamic Visual Injection Strategy is introduced, which retrieves the most relevant visual features at each latent think token and updates the set of best visual patches. The updated patches are then injected into latent think token to achieve dynamic visual-textual interleaving. Experiments across seven multimodal reasoning benchmarks and various model architectures demonstrate that DMLR significantly improves reasoning and perception performance while maintaining high inference efficiency."}

To address the sparsity of difference signals, we further employ curriculum learning that progressively increases complexity from single to multiple differences, enabling stable optimization.

Specifically, given an OCTA with smaller FoV as a source image and a wide-field color fundus photograph (wfCFP) as a target image, our Crop operation exploits the physiological structure of the retina to crop from the target image a sub-image with its FoV roughly aligned with that of the source. This operation allows us to re-purpose the previous small-FoV-disparity oriented methods for subsequent image registration. Moreover, we improve spatial transformation by a double-fitting based Alignment module that utilizes the classical RANSAC algorithm and polynomial-based coordinate fitting in a sequential manner. Extensive experiments on a newly developed test set of 60 OCTA-wfCFP pairs verify the viability of CARe for CMFIR."}

To address these challenges, we propose a Confidence-Aware Asymmetric Learning (CAL) framework, which adaptively balances model confidence across known and novel forgery types. CAL mainly consists of two components: Confidence-Aware Consistency Regularization (CCR) and Asymmetric Confidence Reinforcement (ACR). CCR mitigates pseudo-label bias by dynamically scaling sample losses based on normalized confidence, gradually shifting the training focus from high- to low-confidence samples. ACR complements this by separately calibrating confidence for known and novel classes through selective learning on high-confidence samples, guided by their confidence gap. Together, CCR and ACR form a mutually reinforcing loop that significantly improves the model's OW-DFA performance. Moreover, we introduce a Dynamic Prototype Pruning (DPP) strategy that automatically estimates the number of novel forgery types in a coarse-to-fine manner, removing the need for unrealistic prior assumptions and enhancing the scalability of our methods to real-world OW-DFA scenarios.

To address this important issue, we propose to develop a new approach to progressively recalibrate the self-attention at each layer using a local linear transform parameterized by conditioned scale and shift factors. We consider the online model adaptation from the source domain to the target domain as a progressive domain shift separation process. At each transformer network layer, we learn a Domain Separation Network to extract the domain shift feature, which is used to predict the scale and shift parameters for self-attention recalibration using a Factor Generator Network. These two lightweight networks are adapted online during inference. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed progressive conditioned scale-shift recalibration (PCSR) method is able to significantly improve the online test-time domain adaptation performance by a large margin of up to 3.9\\% in classification accuracy on the ImageNet-C dataset."}

Presents methodology and preliminary experimental results", "summary": "Real-world deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is hindered by high computational demands, as existing architectures inefficiently process all tokens uniformly. We introduce Adaptive Token Pruning (ATP), a dynamic inference mechanism that retains only the most informative tokens based on contextual relevance. ATP operates at the vision-language interface, assigning a hybrid importance score combining ViT CLS attention (intra-modal saliency) and CLIP text-image similarity (inter-modal relevance) to keep top-K tokens for the LLM. Unlike static compression, ATP adapts to each input without modifying the backbone. Proposed as a lightweight gating module, ATP is compatible with popular backbones like BLIP-2, LLaVA, and Flamingo. Preliminary evaluations across VQAv2, GQA, and COCO indicate that ATP reduces inference FLOPs by around 40% and achieves roughly 1.5x speedups in end-to-end latency with negligible accuracy loss (less than 1%). Qualitative analyses suggest ATP preserves visual grounding and enhances interpretability. Beyond efficiency, we investigate robustness under corruptions; observations suggest adaptive pruning suppresses spurious correlations, improving stability. These findings imply that resource-constrained inference and model reliability are not competing objectives. Finally, we discuss ATP's role in efficient multimodal edge computing pipelines."}

However, some human parts in many video frames cannot be seen due to off-screen captures or occlusions. It brings a dilemma: discarding the data missing any part limits scale and diversity, while retaining it compromises data quality and model performance.\n  To address this problem, we propose leveraging credible part-level data extracted from videos to enhance motion generation via a robust part-aware masked autoregression model. First, we decompose a human body into five parts and detect the parts clearly seen in a video frame as \"credible\". Second, the credible parts are encoded into latent tokens by our proposed part-aware variational autoencoder. Third, we propose a robust part-level masked generation model to predict masked credible parts, while ignoring those noisy parts.\n  In addition, we contribute K700-M, a challenging new benchmark comprising approximately 200k real-world motion sequences, for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that our method successfully outperforms baselines on both clean and noisy datasets in terms of motion quality, semantic consistency and diversity.

It is important to restore the 3D shape of the human body and estimate the spine center line. Existing mul-ti-image-based body restoration methods require expensive equipment and complex pro-cedures, and single image-based body restoration methods have limitations in that it is difficult to accurately estimate the internal structure such as the spine center line due to occlusion and viewpoint limitation. This study proposes a method to compensate for the shortcomings of the multi-image-based method and to solve the limitations of the sin-gle-image method. We propose a 3D body posture analysis system that integrates depth images from four directions to restore a 3D human model and automatically estimate the spine center line. Through hierarchical matching of global and fine registration, restora-tion to noise and occlusion is performed. Also, the Adaptive Vertex Reduction is applied to maintain the resolution and shape reliability of the mesh, and the accuracy and stabil-ity of spinal angle estimation are simultaneously secured by using the Level of Detail en-semble. The proposed method achieves high-precision 3D spine registration estimation without relying on training data or complex neural network models, and the verification confirms the improvement of matching quality."}

However, existing methods often rely on a single diffusion model to directly map driving actions to videos, which makes learning difficult and leads to physically inconsistent outputs. To overcome these challenges, we propose GenieDrive, a novel framework designed for physics-aware driving video generation. Our approach starts by generating 4D occupancy, which serves as a physics-informed foundation for subsequent video generation. 4D occupancy contains rich physical information, including high-resolution 3D structures and dynamics. To facilitate effective compression of such high-resolution occupancy, we propose a VAE that encodes occupancy into a latent tri-plane representation, reducing the latent size to only 58% of that used in previous methods. We further introduce Mutual Control Attention (MCA) to accurately model the influence of control on occupancy evolution, and we jointly train the VAE and the subsequent prediction module in an end-to-end manner to maximize forecasting accuracy. Together, these designs yield a 7.2% improvement in forecasting mIoU at an inference speed of 41 FPS, while using only 3.47 M parameters. Additionally, a Normalized Multi-View Attention is introduced in the video generation model to generate multi-view driving videos with guidance from our 4D occupancy, significantly improving video quality with a 20.7% reduction in FVD. Experiments demonstrate that GenieDrive enables highly controllable, multi-view consistent, and physics-aware driving video generation."}

Central to this design is a spatially grounded reasoning representation that decomposes 3D latent space into localized regions, allowing the model to reason over geometry in a compositional and procedural manner.

Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have emerged as a promising solution, offering explicit control, high interpretability, and real-time rendering capabilities (>1000 FPS). However, high-quality 2DGS typically requires post-optimization. Existing methods adopt random or heuristics (e.g., gradient maps), which are often insensitive to image complexity and lead to slow convergence (>10s). More recent approaches introduce learnable networks to predict initial Gaussian configurations, but at the cost of increased computational and architectural complexity. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-2DGS, a lightweight framework for efficient Gaussian image representation. Specifically, we introduce Deep Gaussian Prior, implemented as a conditional network to capture the spatial distribution of Gaussian primitives under different complexities. In addition, we propose an attribute regression network to predict dense Gaussian properties. Experiments demonstrate that this disentangled architecture achieves high-quality reconstruction in a single forward pass, followed by minimal fine-tuning. More importantly, our approach significantly reduces computational cost without compromising visual quality, bringing 2DGS closer to industry-ready deployment."}

However, most existing methods rely solely on the previous frame's features to predict temporal context, leading to two critical issues. First, the short reference window misses long-term dependencies and fine texture details. Second, propagating only feature-level information accumulates errors over frames, causing prediction inaccuracies and loss of subtle textures. To address these, we propose the Long-term Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Context (L-STEC) method. We first extend the reference chain with LSTM to capture long-term dependencies. We then incorporate warped spatial context from the pixel domain, fusing spatio-temporal information through a multi-receptive field network to better preserve reference details. Experimental results show that L-STEC significantly improves compression by enriching contextual information, achieving 37.01% bitrate savings in PSNR and 31.65% in MS-SSIM compared to DCVC-TCM, outperforming both VTM-17.0 and DCVC-FM and establishing new state-of-the-art performance."}

In this paper, we propose DrivePI, a novel spatial-aware 4D MLLM that serves as a unified Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework that is also compatible with vision-action (VA) models. Our method jointly performs spatial understanding, 3D perception (i.e., 3D occupancy), prediction (i.e., occupancy flow), and planning (i.e., action outputs) in parallel through end-to-end optimization. To obtain both precise geometric information and rich visual appearance, our approach integrates point clouds, multi-view images, and language instructions within a unified MLLM architecture. We further develop a data engine to generate text-occupancy and text-flow QA pairs for 4D spatial understanding. Remarkably, with only a 0.5B Qwen2.5 model as MLLM backbone, DrivePI as a single unified model matches or exceeds both existing VLA models and specialized VA models. Specifically, compared to VLA models, DrivePI outperforms OpenDriveVLA-7B by 2.5% mean accuracy on nuScenes-QA and reduces collision rate by 70% over ORION (from 0.37% to 0.11%) on nuScenes. Against specialized VA models, DrivePI surpasses FB-OCC by 10.3 RayIoU for 3D occupancy on OpenOcc, reduces the mAVE from 0.591 to 0.509 for occupancy flow on OpenOcc, and achieves 32% lower L2 error than VAD (from 0.72m to 0.49m) for planning on nuScenes.

The final version may differ from this version", "summary": "Recent advancements in image synthesis have enabled high-quality image generation and manipulation. Most works focus on: 1) conditional manipulation, where an image is modified conditioned on a given attribute, or 2) disentangled representation learning, where each latent direction should represent a distinct semantic attribute. In this paper, we focus on a different and less studied research problem, called Contrastive Analysis (CA). Given two image datasets, we want to separate the common generative factors, shared across the two datasets, from the salient ones, specific to only one dataset. Compared to existing methods, which use attributes as supervised signals for editing (e.g., glasses, gender), the proposed method is weaker, since it only uses the dataset signal. We propose a novel framework for CA, that can be adapted to both GAN and Diffusion models, to learn both common and salient factors. By defining new and well-adapted learning strategies and losses, we ensure a relevant separation between common and salient factors, preserving a high-quality generation. We evaluate our approach on diverse datasets, covering human faces, animal images and medical scans. Our framework demonstrates superior separation ability and image quality synthesis compared to prior methods."}

Existing literature predominantly focuses on dual-encoder architectures like CLIP, leaving a gap in understanding how CoCa's distinct latent space responds to parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on adapting the CoCa visual backbone for few-shot image classification. We systematically evaluate a hierarchy of strategies, ranging from training-free hybrid prototyping to deep parameter adaptation via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). First, we identify an \"augmentation divergence\": while strong data augmentation degrades the performance of linear probing in low-shot settings, it is essential for stabilizing LoRA fine-tuning. We also demonstrate that hybrid objectives incorporating Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) loss yield consistent performance improvements over standard Cross-Entropy across varying shot counts. Crucially, we characterize the sensitivity of training configurations to data scarcity, providing empirical reference settings for scaling regularization, rank, and sampling strategies to facilitate the efficient adaptation of generative-contrastive foundation models."}

Object lists are fed into a Transformer as denoising queries and propagated together with learnable queries through the latter feature aggregation process. Additionally, a deformable Gaussian mask, derived from the positional and size dimensional priors from the object lists, is explicitly integrated into the Transformer decoder. This directs attention toward the target area of interest and accelerates model training convergence. Furthermore, as there is no public dataset containing object lists as a standalone modality, we propose an approach to generate pseudo object lists from ground-truth bounding boxes by simulating state noise and false positives and negatives.

It demonstrates its generalization capability over diverse noise levels of simulated object lists and real detectors."}

Current SCOOD methods mainly adopt various clustering-based in-distribution sample filtering (IDF) strategies to select clean ID samples from unlabeled data, and take the remaining samples as auxiliary OOD data, which inevitably introduces a large number of noisy samples in training. To address the above issue, we propose a concise SCOOD framework based on predictive sample assignment (PSA). PSA includes a dual-threshold ternary sample assignment strategy based on the predictive energy score that can significantly improve the purity of the selected ID and OOD sample sets by assigning unconfident unlabeled data to an additional discard sample set, and a concept contrastive representation learning loss to further expand the distance between ID and OOD samples in the representation space to assist ID/OOD discrimination.

Current GCD methods based on parametric classification adopt the DINO-like pseudo-labeling strategy, where the sharpened probability output of one view is used as supervision information for the other view. However, large pre-trained models have a preference for some specific visual patterns, resulting in encoding spurious correlation for unlabeled data and generating noisy pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, which contains two modules: Loss Sharpness Penalty (LSP) and Dynamic Anchor Selection (DAS). LSP enhances the robustness of model parameters to small perturbations by minimizing the worst-case loss sharpness of the model, which suppressing the encoding of trivial features, thereby reducing overfitting of noise samples and improving the quality of pseudo-labels. Meanwhile, DAS selects representative samples for the unknown classes based on KNN density and class probability during the model training and assigns hard pseudo-labels to them, which not only alleviates the confidence difference between known and unknown classes but also enables the model to quickly learn more accurate feature distribution for the unknown classes, thus further improving the clustering accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively mitigate the noise of pseudo-labels, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple GCD benchmarks."}

Existing approaches often fall short in modeling temporal dependencies across multiple events and in handling queries that reference unseen or rare visual concepts. To address these challenges, we introduce MADTempo, a video retrieval framework developed by our team, AIO_Trinh, that unifies temporal search with web-scale visual grounding. Our temporal search mechanism captures event-level continuity by aggregating similarity scores across sequential video segments, enabling coherent retrieval of multi-event queries. Complementarily, a Google Image Search-based fallback module expands query representations with external web imagery, effectively bridging gaps in pretrained visual embeddings and improving robustness against out-of-distribution (OOD) queries. Together, these components advance the temporal reasoning and generalization capabilities of modern video retrieval systems, paving the way for more semantically aware and adaptive retrieval across large-scale video corpora."}

However, existing approaches face three critical challenges: (1) fixed-weight fusion strategies fail across cross modal noise and ambiguous queries, (2) temporal modeling struggles to capture coherent event sequences while penalizing unrealistic gaps, and (3) systems require manual modality selection, reducing usability. We propose a unified multimodal moment retrieval system with three key innovations. First, a cascaded dual-embedding pipeline combines BEIT-3 and SigLIP for broad retrieval, refined by BLIP-2 based reranking to balance recall and precision. Second, a temporal-aware scoring mechanism applies exponential decay penalties to large temporal gaps via beam search, constructing coherent event sequences rather than isolated frames. Third, Agent-guided query decomposition (GPT-4o) automatically interprets ambiguous queries, decomposes them into modality specific sub-queries (visual/OCR/ASR), and performs adaptive score fusion eliminating manual modality selection. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that our system effectively handles ambiguous queries, retrieves temporally coherent sequences, and dynamically adapts fusion strategies, advancing interactive moment search capabilities."}

Existing methods employ convolutional or self-attention blocks to capture the multi-scale features in the segmentation models, while the inherent gap of the feature pyramids and insufficient global-local feature integration leads to inaccurate, ambiguous extraction results. To address this issue, in this paper, we present an Uncertainty-Aggregated Global-Local Fusion Network (UAGLNet), which is capable to exploit high-quality global-local visual semantics under the guidance of uncertainty modeling. Specifically, we propose a novel cooperative encoder, which adopts hybrid CNN and transformer layers at different stages to capture the local and global visual semantics, respectively. An intermediate cooperative interaction block (CIB) is designed to narrow the gap between the local and global features when the network becomes deeper. Afterwards, we propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) module to complementarily fuse the global and local representations. Moreover, to mitigate the segmentation ambiguity in uncertain regions, we propose an Uncertainty-Aggregated Decoder (UAD) to explicitly estimate the pixel-wise uncertainty to enhance the segmentation accuracy.

Our systematic analysis, diagnoses this failure by identifying two core issues: severe data-level heterogeneity, which causes the feature distributions of real and synthetic images to increasingly overlap, and a critical model-level bottleneck from fixed, pretrained encoders that cannot adapt to the rising complexity. To address these challenges, we propose Generator-Aware Prototype Learning (GAPL), a framework that constrain representation with a structured learning paradigm. GAPL learns a compact set of canonical forgery prototypes to create a unified, low-variance feature space, effectively countering data heterogeneity.To resolve the model bottleneck, it employs a two-stage training scheme with Low-Rank Adaptation, enhancing its discriminative power while preserving valuable pretrained knowledge. This approach establishes a more robust and generalizable decision boundary.

Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy."}

In this work, we introduce an object tracking method based on light field images that does not depend on a pre-trained model, while being robust to complex visual behavior, such as reflections. We extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models and convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats.

We further introduce a light field object tracking dataset containing challenging reflective objects with precise ground truth poses.

Meanwhile, despite the success of deep learning in medical imaging, the lack of interpretability limits its clinical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose TWLR, a two-stage framework for interpretable diabetic retinopathy (DR) assessment. In the first stage, a vision-language model integrates domain-specific ophthalmological knowledge into text embeddings to jointly perform DR grading and lesion classification, effectively linking semantic medical concepts with visual features. The second stage introduces an iterative severity regression framework based on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Lesion saliency maps generated through iterative refinement direct a progressive inpainting mechanism that systematically eliminates pathological features, effectively downgrading disease severity toward healthier fundus appearances. Critically, this severity regression approach achieves dual benefits: accurate lesion localization without pixel-level supervision and providing an interpretable visualization of disease-to-healthy transformations. Experimental results on the FGADR, DDR, and a private dataset demonstrate that TWLR achieves competitive performance in both DR classification and lesion segmentation, offering a more explainable and annotation-efficient solution for automated retinal image analysis."}

However, existing methods necessitate to either predict pseudo annotations after image generation or generate images conditioned on manual annotation masks, which incurs image-annotation semantic inconsistency or scalability problem. To migrate both problems with one stone, we present a novel dataset generative diffusion framework for semantic segmentation, termed JoDiffusion. Firstly, given a standard latent diffusion model, JoDiffusion incorporates an independent annotation variational auto-encoder (VAE) network to map annotation masks into the latent space shared by images. Then, the diffusion model is tailored to capture the joint distribution of each image and its annotation mask conditioned on a text prompt. By doing these, JoDiffusion enables simultaneously generating paired images and semantically consistent annotation masks solely conditioned on text prompts, thereby demonstrating superior scalability. Additionally, a mask optimization strategy is developed to mitigate the annotation noise produced during generation. Experiments on Pascal VOC, COCO, and ADE20K datasets show that the annotated dataset generated by JoDiffusion yields substantial performance improvements in semantic segmentation compared to existing methods."}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel Bidirectional Image-Guided Concept Erasure (Bi-Erasing) framework that performs concept suppression and safety enhancement simultaneously. Specifically, based on the joint representation of text prompts and corresponding images, Bi-Erasing introduces two decoupled image branches: a negative branch responsible for suppressing harmful semantics and a positive branch providing visual guidance for safe alternatives. By jointly optimizing these complementary directions, our approach achieves a balance between erasure efficacy and generation usability. In addition, we apply mask-based filtering to the image branches to prevent interference from irrelevant content during the erasure process. Across extensive experiment evaluations, the proposed Bi-Erasing outperforms baseline methods in balancing concept removal effectiveness and visual fidelity."}

Specifically, we employ a multi-modal, multi-layer RAG system that provides real-time guidance for model fine-tuning through dynamic, on-demand knowledge retrieval. Building upon this, we introduce a dynamic knowledge distillation framework. This framework precisely resolves the aforementioned core dilemma by dynamically modulating the importance of the parameter space, the granularity of the distilled knowledge, and the data distribution of the reference dataset in accordance with the required level of detail. To thoroughly validate the clinical value of our strategy, we have designed a more rigorous \\textbf{M}edical Generalist Task Incremental Learning (MGTIL) benchmark. This benchmark is engineered to simultaneously evaluate the model's capacity for adaptation to significant domain shifts, retention of subtle intra-domain features, and real-time learning of novel and complex medical tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all metrics. The code is provided in the supplementary materials."}

Vol.102. No. 20", "summary": "This study provides an overview of heart disease prediction using an intelligent system. Predicting disease accurately is crucial in the medical field, but traditional methods relying solely on a doctor's experience often lack precision. To address this limitation, intelligent systems are applied as an alternative to traditional approaches. While various intelligent system methods exist, this study focuses on three: Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). A comparison of these techniques in terms of accuracy was conducted, and ultimately, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) was selected for heart disease prediction. In the prediction phase, the heart disease dataset underwent data pre-processing to clean the data and data splitting to separate it into training and testing sets. The chosen intelligent system was then employed to predict heart disease outcomes based on the processed data. The experiment concluded with Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) achieving a notable accuracy rate of 97.95% in predicting heart disease. The findings also revealed that the probability of heart disease was 57.76% for males and 42.24% for females. Further analysis from related studies suggests that factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption are significant contributors to heart disease, particularly among males."}

Most existing CD methods rely on supervised learning, making performance strongly dataset-dependent and incurring high annotation costs; they typically focus on a few predefined categories and generalize poorly to diverse scenes. With the rise of vision foundation models such as SAM2 and CLIP, new opportunities have emerged to relax these constraints. We propose Unified Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (UniVCD), an unsupervised, open-vocabulary change detection method built on frozen SAM2 and CLIP. UniVCD detects category-agnostic changes across diverse scenes and imaging geometries without any labeled data or paired change images. A lightweight feature alignment module is introduced to bridge the spatially detailed representations from SAM2 and the semantic priors from CLIP, enabling high-resolution, semantically aware change estimation while keeping the number of trainable parameters small. On top of this, a streamlined post-processing pipeline is further introduced to suppress noise and pseudo-changes, improving the detection accuracy for objects with well-defined boundaries. Experiments on several public BCD (Binary Change Detection) and SCD (Semantic Change Detection) benchmarks show that UniVCD achieves consistently strong performance and matches or surpasses existing open-vocabulary CD methods in key metrics such as F1 and IoU. The results demonstrate that unsupervised change detection with frozen vision foundation models and lightweight multi-modal alignment is a practical and effective paradigm for open-vocabulary CD.

However, existing hint-based RL methods typically ignore difficulty when scheduling hint ratios and estimating relative advantages, leading to unstable learning and excessive imitation of off-policy hints. In this work, we propose ADHint, which treats difficulty as a key factor in both hint-ratio schedule and relative-advantage estimation to achieve a better trade-off between exploration and imitation. Specifically, we propose Adaptive Hint with Sample Difficulty Prior, which evaluates each sample's difficulty under the policy model and accordingly schedules an appropriate hint ratio to guide its rollouts. We also introduce Consistency-based Gradient Modulation and Selective Masking for Hint Preservation to modulate token-level gradients within hints, preventing biased and destructive updates. Additionally, we propose Advantage Estimation with Rollout Difficulty Posterior, which leverages the relative difficulty of rollouts with and without hints to estimate their respective advantages, thereby achieving more balanced updates. Extensive experiments across diverse modalities, model scales, and domains demonstrate that ADHint delivers superior reasoning ability and out-of-distribution generalization, consistently surpassing existing methods in both pass@1 and avg@8.

However, they often struggle to generalize to specialized clinical tasks under limited annotations or rare pathological variations, due to a mismatch between general priors and task-specific requirements. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL), a dual-teacher framework that harmonizes generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements."}

From detection results, we construct a pest situation analysis framework using: (1) Kernel Density Estimation to locate infection hotspots; (2) neighborhood evaluation to assess healthy trees' infection risk; (3) DBSCAN clustering to identify high-density healthy clusters as priority protection zones. Experiments on UAV imagery from 32 forest plots in eastern Tianshan, China, show that FID-Net achieves 86.10% precision, 75.44% recall, 82.29% mAP@0.5, and 64.30% mAP@0.5:0.95, outperforming mainstream YOLO models.

Our key insight is that diffusion models possess strong capabilities for denoising and generating data that can adapt to various weather conditions. Building on this, DiffFusion introduces Diffusion-IR restoring images degraded by weather effects and Point Cloud Restoration (PCR) compensating for corrupted LiDAR data using image object cues. To tackle misalignments between two modalities, we develop Bidirectional Adaptive Fusion and Alignment Module (BAFAM). It enables dynamic multi-modal fusion and bidirectional bird's-eye view (BEV) alignment to maintain consistent spatial correspondence. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that DiffFusion achieves state-of-the-art robustness under adverse weather while preserving strong clean-data performance.

Motivated by this, we propose DePT3R, a novel framework that simultaneously performs dense point tracking and 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes from multiple images in a single forward pass. This multi-task learning is achieved by extracting deep spatio-temporal features with a powerful backbone and regressing pixel-wise maps with dense prediction heads.

Existing plant-specific tracking methods are typically limited to small-scale species or rely on constrained imaging conditions. In contrast, generic multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are not designed for dynamic biological scenes. Progress in the development of accurate leaf tracking models has also been hindered by a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce CanolaTrack, a new benchmark dataset comprising 5,704 RGB images with 31,840 annotated leaf instances spanning the early growth stages of 184 canola plants. To enable accurate leaf tracking over time, we introduce LeafTrackNet, an efficient framework that combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy. LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on CanolaTrack.

We first validate our method by successfully detecting artificially induced shortcut learning. We then apply it to probe the feature utilization of an SA-SonoNet model trained for Spontaneous Preterm Birth (sPTB) prediction. Our analysis confirmed that while the embeddings contain substantial metadata, the sPTB classifier's weight vectors were highly correlated with clinically relevant factors (e.g., birth weight) but decoupled from clinically irrelevant acquisition factors (e.g. scanner).

Unsupervised depth completion methods have been proposed for various datasets where ground truth depth data is unavailable and supervised methods cannot be applied. However, these models require auxiliary data to estimate depth values, which is far from real scenarios. Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models can produce a plausible relative depth map from a single image, but there is no work to properly combine the sparse depth map with MDE for depth completion; a simple affine transformation to the depth map will yield a high error since MDE are inaccurate at estimating depth difference between objects. We introduce StarryGazer, a domain-agnostic framework that predicts dense depth images from a single sparse depth image and an RGB image without relying on ground-truth depth by leveraging the power of large MDE models. First, we employ a pre-trained MDE model to produce relative depth images. These images are segmented and randomly rescaled to form synthetic pairs for dense pseudo-ground truth and corresponding sparse depths. A refinement network is trained with the synthetic pairs, incorporating the relative depth maps and RGB images to improve the model's accuracy and robustness. StarryGazer shows superior results over existing unsupervised methods and transformed MDE results on various datasets, demonstrating that our framework exploits the power of MDE models while appropriately fixing errors using sparse depth information."}

We leverage a diffusion-based material estimator that produces multiple, but often inconsistent, candidate decompositions per view. To reduce the inconsistency, we fit an explicit low-dimensional parametric function to the predictions. We then propose a robust optimization framework using soft per-view prediction selection together with confidence-based soft multi-view inlier set to fuse the most consistent predictions of the most confident views into a consistent parametric material space. Finally, we use inverse path tracing to optimize for the low-dimensional parameters.

This model generates diverse pathological images spanning 30 cancer types, with quality rigorously validated by objective metrics and pathologist evaluations. Furthermore, CRAFTS-augmented datasets enhance the performance across various clinical tasks, including classification, cross-modal retrieval, self-supervised learning, and visual question answering.

This study proposes MMDrive, an multimodal vision-language model framework that extends traditional image understanding to a generalized 3D scene understanding framework. MMDrive incorporates three complementary modalities, including occupancy maps, LiDAR point clouds, and textual scene descriptions. To this end, it introduces two novel components for adaptive cross-modal fusion and key information extraction. Specifically, the Text-oriented Multimodal Modulator dynamically weights the contributions of each modality based on the semantic cues in the question, guiding context-aware feature integration. The Cross-Modal Abstractor employs learnable abstract tokens to generate compact, cross-modal summaries that highlight key regions and essential semantics. Comprehensive evaluations on the DriveLM and NuScenes-QA benchmarks demonstrate that MMDrive achieves significant performance gains over existing vision-language models for autonomous driving, with a BLEU-4 score of 54.56 and METEOR of 41.78 on DriveLM, and an accuracy score of 62.7% on NuScenes-QA.

To bridge this gap, we re-examine different fusion paradigms, and recover that the strengths of intermediate and late fusion are not a trade-off, but a complementary pairing. Based on this key insight, we propose CoRA, a novel collaborative robust architecture with a hybrid approach to decouple performance from robustness with low communication. It is composed of two components: a feature-level fusion branch and an object-level correction branch. Its first branch selects critical features and fuses them efficiently to ensure both performance and scalability. The second branch leverages semantic relevance to correct spatial displacements, guaranteeing resilience against pose errors. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoRA. Under extreme scenarios, CoRA improves upon its baseline performance by approximately 19% in AP@0.7 with more than 5x less communication volume, which makes it a promising solution for robust collaborative perception."}

Existing 2D speech-to-video diffusion models depend heavily on reference guidance, leading to limited motion diversity. At the same time, 3D-aware animation typically relies on inversion through pre-trained tri-plane generators, which often leads to imperfect reconstructions and identity drift. We rethink reference- and geometry-based paradigms in two ways. First, we deviate from strict reference conditioning at pre-training by introducing softer identity constraints. Second, we address 3D awareness implicitly within the 2D video domain by leveraging the inherent multi-view nature of video data. STARCaster adopts a compositional approach progressing from ID-aware motion modeling, to audio-visual synchronization via lip reading-based supervision, and finally to novel view animation through temporal-to-spatial adaptation. To overcome the scarcity of 4D audio-visual data, we propose a decoupled learning approach in which view consistency and temporal coherence are trained independently. A self-forcing training scheme enables the model to learn from longer temporal contexts than those generated at inference, mitigating the overly static animations common in existing autoregressive approaches.

To support this task, we construct a synthetic dataset with automatically generated paired query-target views and question-answer prompts.

To address this issue, we propose CausalCLIP, a framework that explicitly disentangles causal from non-causal features and employs targeted filtering guided by causal inference principles to retain only the most transferable and discriminative forensic cues. By modeling the generation process with a structural causal model and enforcing statistical independence through Gumbel-Softmax-based feature masking and Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) constraints, CausalCLIP isolates stable causal features robust to distribution shifts.

We introduce the Causal Scene Graph (CSG) and the Physical Alignment Probe (PAP) dataset to enable diagnostic interventions. This analysis yields three key insights. First, DMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning for elements not explicitly determined in the prompt. Second, the prompt embedding contains disentangled representations for texture and physics.

To address these challenges, we propose KlingAvatar 2.0, a spatio-temporal cascade framework that performs upscaling in both spatial resolution and temporal dimension. The framework first generates low-resolution blueprint video keyframes that capture global semantics and motion, and then refines them into high-resolution, temporally coherent sub-clips using a first-last frame strategy, while retaining smooth temporal transitions in long-form videos. To enhance cross-modal instruction fusion and alignment in extended videos, we introduce a Co-Reasoning Director composed of three modality-specific large language model (LLM) experts.

However, as with other surveillance-oriented technologies, such systems raise serious privacy concerns due to their potential for unauthorized identity tracking. While several works have explored machine unlearning as a means of privacy protection, their applicability to face retrieval - especially for modern embedding-based recognition models - remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study the problem of face identity unlearning for retrieval systems and present its inherent challenges. The goal is to make selected identities unretrievable by dispersing their embeddings on the hypersphere and preventing the formation of compact identity clusters that enable re-identification in the gallery. The primary challenge is to achieve this forgetting effect while preserving the discriminative structure of the embedding space and the retrieval performance of the model for the remaining identities. To address this, we evaluate several existing approximate class unlearning methods (e.g., Random Labeling, Gradient Ascent, Boundary Unlearning, and other recent approaches) in the context of face retrieval and propose a simple yet effective dispersion-based unlearning approach. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (VGGFace2, CelebA) demonstrate that our method achieves superior forgetting behavior while preserving retrieval utility."}

To address these limitations, we present a framework that leverages the intrinsic robustness of DINO self-attention \"key\" features for robust segmentation. Unlike traditional methods that extract tokens from the deepest layers of the Vision Transformer (ViT), our approach leverages the key features of the self-attention module with a simple convolutional decoder to predict polyp masks, resulting in enhanced performance and better generalizability.

Current image-to-video pipelines produce plausible motion but struggle to generate predictable, articulated motions while enforcing user-specified content in newly revealed areas. Our key idea is to separate motion specification from appearance synthesis: we introduce a lightweight, user-editable Proxy Dynamic Graph (PDG) that deterministically yet approximately drives part motion, while a frozen diffusion prior is used to synthesize plausible appearance that follows that motion. In our training-free pipeline, the user loosely annotates and reposes a PDG, from which we compute a dense motion flow to leverage diffusion as a motion-guided shader. We then let the user edit appearance in the disoccluded areas of the image, and exploit the visibility information encoded by the PDG to perform a latent-space composite that reconciles motion with user intent in these areas. This design yields controllable articulation and user control over disocclusions without fine-tuning. We demonstrate clear advantages against state-of-the-art alternatives towards images turned into short videos of articulated objects, furniture, vehicles, and deformables.

Fixing these artifacts typically requires hand-crafted refinement rules or architectures specialized to a particular task. Here, we show that Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) can be directly re-purposed as an effective refinement mechanism, using local, iterative updates guided by image context to repair segmentation masks. By training on imperfect masks and ground truths, the automaton learns the structural properties of the target shape while relying solely on local information. When applied to coarse, globally predicted masks, the learned dynamics progressively reconnect broken regions, prune loose fragments and converge towards stable, topologically consistent results. We show how refinement NCA (rNCA) can be easily applied to repair common topological errors produced by different base segmentation models and tasks: for fragmented retinal vessels, it yields 2-3% gains in Dice/clDice and improves Betti errors, reducing $β_0$ errors by 60% and $β_1$ by 20%; for myocardium, it repairs 61.5% of broken cases in a zero-shot setting while lowering ASSD and HD by 19% and 16%, respectively.

These assets are then used in a game engine where physics simulations create natural arrangements. A novel, two-pass rendering technique combines the realism of splats with a shadow map generated from proxy meshes. This map is then algorithmically composited with the image to add both physically plausible shadows and subtle highlights, significantly enhancing realism.

The dimensionality of latent space governs both reconstruction fidelity and the semantic expressiveness of the latent feature. However, a fundamental trade-off is inherent between dimensionality and generation quality, constraining existing methods to low-dimensional latent spaces. Although recent works have leveraged vision foundation models to enrich the semantics of visual tokenizers and accelerate convergence, high-dimensional tokenizers still underperform their low-dimensional counterparts. In this work, we propose RecTok, which overcomes the limitations of high-dimensional visual tokenizers through two key innovations: flow semantic distillation and reconstruction--alignment distillation. Our key insight is to make the forward flow in flow matching semantically rich, which serves as the training space of diffusion transformers, rather than focusing on the latent space as in previous works. Specifically, our method distills the semantic information in VFMs into the forward flow trajectories in flow matching. And we further enhance the semantics by introducing a masked feature reconstruction loss. Our RecTok achieves superior image reconstruction, generation quality, and discriminative performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the gFID-50K under both with and without classifier-free guidance settings, while maintaining a semantically rich latent space structure.

The proposed framework was evaluated across multiple experimental setups, including both laboratory-controlled and field-captured datasets. On tomato leaf diseases from the PlantVillage dataset, it consistently improved performance across 1 to 15 shot scenarios, reaching 98.23+-0.33% at 15 shot, closely approaching the 99.98% SOTA benchmark achieved by a Transductive LSTM with attention, while remaining lightweight and mobile-friendly. Under real-world conditions using field images from the Dhan Shomadhan dataset, it maintained robust performance, reaching 69.28+-1.49% at 15-shot and demonstrating strong resilience to complex backgrounds.

In this work, we introduce IMILIA (Interpretable Multiple Instance Learning for Inflammation Analysis), an end-to-end framework designed for the prediction of inflammation presence in IBD digitized slides stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), followed by the automated computation of markers characterizing tissue regions driving the predictions. IMILIA is composed of an inflammation prediction module, consisting of a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) model, and an interpretability module, divided in two blocks: HistoPLUS, for cell instance detection, segmentation and classification; and EpiSeg, for epithelium segmentation. IMILIA achieves a cross-validation ROC-AUC of 0.83 on the discovery cohort, and a ROC-AUC of 0.99 and 0.84 on two external validation cohorts. The interpretability module yields biologically consistent insights: tiles with higher predicted scores show increased densities of immune cells (lymphocytes, plasmocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas lower-scored tiles predominantly contain normal epithelial cells. Notably, these patterns were consistent across all datasets. Code and models to partially replicate the results on the public IBDColEpi dataset can be found at https://github.com/owkin/imilia."}

To address this issue, we propose PoseAnything, the first universal pose-guided video generation framework capable of handling both human and non-human characters, supporting arbitrary skeletal inputs. To enhance consistency preservation during motion, we introduce Part-aware Temporal Coherence Module, which divides the subject into different parts, establishes part correspondences, and computes cross-attention between corresponding parts across frames to achieve fine-grained part-level consistency. Additionally, we propose Subject and Camera Motion Decoupled CFG, a novel guidance strategy that, for the first time, enables independent camera movement control in pose-guided video generation, by separately injecting subject and camera motion control information into the positive and negative anchors of CFG. Furthermore, we present XPose, a high-quality public dataset containing 50,000 non-human pose-video pairs, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pose-Anything significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and generalization."}

However, as humans by nature tend to act in a collaborative manner, behavioral anomalies can also arise from human-human interactions. Detecting such anomalies using existing single-person AD models is prone to low accuracy, as these approaches are typically not designed to capture the complex and asymmetric dynamics of interactions. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, Human-Human Interaction Anomaly Detection (H2IAD), which aims to identify anomalous interactive behaviors within collaborative 3D human actions. To address H2IAD, we then propose Interaction Anomaly Detection Network (IADNet), which is formalized with a Temporal Attention Sharing Module (TASM). Specifically, in designing TASM, we share the encoded motion embeddings across both people such that collaborative motion correlations can be effectively synchronized. Moreover, we notice that in addition to temporal dynamics, human interactions are also characterized by spatial configurations between two people. We thus introduce a Distance-Based Relational Encoding Module (DREM) to better reflect social cues in H2IAD. The normalizing flow is eventually employed for anomaly scoring. Extensive experiments on human-human motion benchmarks demonstrate that IADNet outperforms existing Human-centric AD baselines in H2IAD."}

However, existing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly limited to single-step reasoning, as existing benchmarks lack the complexity needed to evaluate and drive multi-hop abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMhops, a novel, large-scale benchmark designed to systematically evaluate and foster multi-modal multi-hop reasoning. MMhops dataset comprises two challenging task formats, Bridging and Comparison, which necessitate that models dynamically construct complex reasoning chains by integrating external knowledge. To tackle the challenges posed by MMhops, we propose MMhops-R1, a novel multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) framework for dynamic reasoning. Our framework utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the model for autonomously planning reasoning paths, formulating targeted queries, and synthesizing multi-level information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MMhops-R1 significantly outperforms strong baselines on MMhops, highlighting that dynamic planning and multi-modal knowledge integration are crucial for complex reasoning. Moreover, MMhops-R1 demonstrates strong generalization to tasks requiring fixed-hop reasoning, underscoring the robustness of our dynamic planning approach. In conclusion, our work contributes a challenging new benchmark and a powerful baseline model, and we will release the associated code, data, and weights to catalyze future research in this critical area."}

The well-established single-cell sequencing field, however, could provide rich biological data as an effective auxiliary source to mitigate this limitation. To bridge these gaps, we introduce SCR2-ST, a unified framework that leverages single-cell prior knowledge to guide efficient data acquisition and accurate expression prediction. SCR2-ST integrates a single-cell guided reinforcement learning-based (SCRL) active sampling and a hybrid regression-retrieval prediction network SCR2Net. SCRL combines single-cell foundation model embeddings with spatial density information to construct biologically grounded reward signals, enabling selective acquisition of informative tissue regions under constrained sequencing budgets. SCR2Net then leverages the actively sampled data through a hybrid architecture combining regression-based modeling with retrieval-augmented inference, where a majority cell-type filtering mechanism suppresses noisy matches and retrieved expression profiles serve as soft labels for auxiliary supervision. We evaluated SCR2-ST on three public ST datasets, demonstrating SOTA performance in both sampling efficiency and prediction accuracy, particularly under low-budget scenarios.

The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving."}

In addition to high-fidelity RGB images, we provide multiple complementary modalities, including depth, surface normals, object segmentation and optical flow, enabling a deeper understanding of scene geometry and motion. The dataset is organised into three distinct benchmarking scenarios: a dense multi-view camera setup, a sparse camera arrangement, and monocular video sequences, enabling a wide range of experimentation and comparison across varying levels of data sparsity.

However, existing detection methods provide only limited exploration of the 3D geometric patterns present in generated videos. In this paper, we use vanishing points as an explicit representation of 3D geometry patterns, revealing fundamental discrepancies in geometric consistency between real and AI-generated videos. We introduce Grab-3D, a geometry-aware transformer framework for detecting AI-generated videos based on 3D geometric temporal consistency. To enable reliable evaluation, we construct an AI-generated video dataset of static scenes, allowing stable 3D geometric feature extraction. We propose a geometry-aware transformer equipped with geometric positional encoding, temporal-geometric attention, and an EMA-based geometric classifier head to explicitly inject 3D geometric awareness into temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that Grab-3D significantly outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, achieving robust cross-domain generalization to unseen generators."}

Single-pass vision-language models (VLMs) often overlook small abnormalities and lack explicit mechanisms to compare against canonical normal patterns. We propose AgentIAD, a tool-driven agentic framework that enables multi-stage visual inspection. The agent is equipped with a Perceptive Zoomer (PZ) for localized fine-grained analysis and a Comparative Retriever (CR) for querying normal exemplars when evidence is ambiguous. To teach these inspection behaviors, we construct structured perceptive and comparative trajectories from the MMAD dataset and train the model in two stages: supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning. A two-part reward design drives this process: a perception reward that supervises classification accuracy, spatial alignment, and type correctness, and a behavior reward that encourages efficient tool use. Together, these components enable the model to refine its judgment through step-wise observation, zooming, and verification. AgentIAD achieves a new state-of-the-art 97.62% classification accuracy on MMAD, surpassing prior MLLM-based approaches while producing transparent and interpretable inspection traces."}

Despite recent encouraging advances, existing methods face two critical limitations. First, most existing approaches can only generate ambient sounds and lack the capability to produce human speech synchronized with lip movements. Second, recent attempts at unified human video-audio generation typically rely on explicit fusion or modality-specific alignment modules, which introduce additional architecture design and weaken the model simplicity of the original transformers. To address these issues, JoVA employs joint self-attention across video and audio tokens within each transformer layer, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal interaction without the need for additional alignment modules. Furthermore, to enable high-quality lip-speech synchronization, we introduce a simple yet effective mouth-area loss based on facial keypoint detection, which enhances supervision on the critical mouth region during training without compromising architectural simplicity. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that JoVA outperforms or is competitive with both unified and audio-driven state-of-the-art methods in lip-sync accuracy, speech quality, and overall video-audio generation fidelity. Our results establish JoVA as an elegant framework for high-quality multimodal generation."}

However, to use AI-generated 3D assets in real applications, a critical requirement is the capability to edit them easily. We present a feedforward method, Steer3D, to add text steerability to image-to-3D models, which enables editing of generated 3D assets with language. Our approach is inspired by ControlNet, which we adapt to image-to-3D generation to enable text steering directly in a forward pass. We build a scalable data engine for automatic data generation, and develop a two-stage training recipe based on flow-matching training and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Compared to competing methods, Steer3D more faithfully follows the language instruction and maintains better consistency with the original 3D asset, while being 2.4x to 28.5x faster. Steer3D demonstrates that it is possible to add a new modality (text) to steer the generation of pretrained image-to-3D generative models with 100k data.

While existing streaming methods address this through learned memory mechanisms or causal attention, they require extensive retraining and may not fully leverage the strong geometric priors of state-of-the-art offline models. We propose LASER, a training-free framework that converts an offline reconstruction model into a streaming system by aligning predictions across consecutive temporal windows. We observe that simple similarity transformation ($\\mathrm{Sim}(3)$) alignment fails due to layer depth misalignment: monocular scale ambiguity causes relative depth scales of different scene layers to vary inconsistently between windows. To address this, we introduce layer-wise scale alignment, which segments depth predictions into discrete layers, computes per-layer scale factors, and propagates them across both adjacent windows and timestamps. Extensive experiments show that LASER achieves state-of-the-art performance on camera pose estimation and point map reconstruction %quality with offline models while operating at 14 FPS with 6 GB peak memory on a RTX A6000 GPU, enabling practical deployment for kilometer-scale streaming videos.

Existing learning-based approaches ground spatial understanding in limited scene dataset, restricting generalization to new layouts. We instead reprogram a pre-trained 3D instance generator to act as a scene level learner, replacing dataset-bounded supervision with model-centric spatial supervision. This reprogramming unlocks the generator transferable spatial knowledge, enabling generalization to unseen layouts and novel object compositions. Remarkably, spatial reasoning still emerges even when the training scenes are randomly composed objects. This demonstrates that the generator's transferable scene prior provides a rich learning signal for inferring proximity, support, and symmetry from purely geometric cues. Replacing widely used canonical space, we instantiate this insight with a view-centric formulation of the scene space, yielding a fully feed-forward, generalizable scene generator that learns spatial relations directly from the instance model. Quantitative and qualitative results show that a 3D instance generator is an implicit spatial learner and reasoner, pointing toward foundation models for interactive 3D scene understanding and generation.

RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion."}

However, the standard reconstruction-based training paradigm produces a latent space that is biased towards low-level information, leading to a foundation flaw: better pixel-level accuracy does not lead to higher-quality generation. This implies that pouring extensive compute into visual tokenizer pre-training translates poorly to improved performance in generation. We identify this as the ``pre-training scaling problem`` and suggest a necessary shift: to be effective for generation, a latent space must concisely represent high-level semantics. We present VTP, a unified visual tokenizer pre-training framework, pioneering the joint optimization of image-text contrastive, self-supervised, and reconstruction losses. Our large-scale study reveals two principal findings: (1) understanding is a key driver of generation, and (2) much better scaling properties, where generative performance scales effectively with compute, parameters, and data allocated to the pretraining of the visual tokenizer. After large-scale pre-training, our tokenizer delivers a competitive profile (78.2 zero-shot accuracy and 0.36 rFID on ImageNet) and 4.1 times faster convergence on generation compared to advanced distillation methods. More importantly, it scales effectively: without modifying standard DiT training specs, solely investing more FLOPS in pretraining VTP achieves 65.8\\% FID improvement in downstream generation, while conventional autoencoder stagnates very early at 1/10 FLOPS.

Guided by this design principle, we propose a new, improved 3D point cloud backbone that employs convolutions in early stages and switches to attention for deeper layers. To avoid the loss of spatial layout information when discarding redundant convolution layers, we introduce a novel, training-free 3D positional encoding, PointROPE.

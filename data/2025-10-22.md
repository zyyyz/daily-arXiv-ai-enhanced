Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to
navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods
rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose
MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a
collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents
to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss
functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to
balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing
accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with
dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it
ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC,
COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of
97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP
of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an
mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated
convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a
scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the
way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning
to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of
training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data
selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse
subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational
overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due
to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes
data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing
approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO
employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small
random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,
drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic
uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and
diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of
randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to
select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used
LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved
an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on
average.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median
survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol
serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly
heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before
first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction
treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease
Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution,
while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of
therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on
timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a
slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a
pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem
we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning
from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free
guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in
particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on
a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois
Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor
localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts,
and survival information.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has
enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital
content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion
techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those
created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication.
Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains
unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital
media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection
framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish
AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on
the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity
to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly
within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that
processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five
benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the
robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high
perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images
maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution
provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that
balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short
verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in
conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the
smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like,
responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is
often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across
multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level)
to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level).
This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion
recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing
individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale,
overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual
Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized
backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from
observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this
normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's
baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data
distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments
and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual
differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
backchannel agreement detection.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting
large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step
samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting
in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible
trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding
incompatible with existing models unless retraining from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism
to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation
principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the
velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided
distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g.,
producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method
can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that
inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This
capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation
method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion
models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or
data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in
challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that
bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer
vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a
``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique
circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which
plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying
anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency
such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By
integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with
simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of
our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

Abstract: We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that
bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray
structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as
medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We
collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align
RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to
ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the
challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities
and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the
applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive
testing capabilities across various domains.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity
Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D
object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates
rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input
query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings,
where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM)
to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the
matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute
and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under
challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an
uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without
any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core,
H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a
powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and
segmentation.

Abstract: The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the
scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten
historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text

architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic,

Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the
Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual
fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols
exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic
score generation.

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic
imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender
classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant
intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these
flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of
these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even
these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher
rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these
data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by
blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other
collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize
subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only
real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace,
it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over
50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of
1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall
accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric
interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender
classification research.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic
segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly
reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ
class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this
challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient
exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical
bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation
method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance
mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed
methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more
balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial
refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific
optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is
developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to
effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with
geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive
unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates
Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process
continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,
ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.
Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks
while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised
settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the
field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in
MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data.
Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive
attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we
evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,
and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the
left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset
including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,
and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train
and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first
assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the
volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their
interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to
quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed
models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and
derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to
significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show
notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on
race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance
independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects
on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our
biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual
segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects
disappear in all but one model.

culturally aware emotion AI development and personalized entertainment systems
tailored to non Western contexts.

Abstract: Engagement detection in online learning environments is vital for improving

designed to assess student engagement from video data using a dual-stream
architecture. ViBED-Net captures both facial expressions and full-scene context
by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for
spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using
two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and
Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a
large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance
performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data
augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM
achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.
ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal
cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design
allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research,
and content personalization. This work advances video-based affective computing
by offering a scalable, high-performing solution for real-world engagement

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of
rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision
Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting
approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary
models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis
with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that
achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from
input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline:
structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our
approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis
across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and
Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world
driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More
importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned
7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8%
accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at
near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with
high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly
detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic
monitoring for autonomous systems.

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in
regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and
economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is
critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and
comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the
infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates
Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for
deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study
applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a
major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set
of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise,
Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree,
and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep
learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM,
and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification,
all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish
Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease
classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation
time and improving dataset reliability.

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and
natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an

struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video
trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and
integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We
synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views
along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset,
which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D
reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that
incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves
performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both
individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work
enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and
touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing
images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for
composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user
specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a
personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining
specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions.
To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464
unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we
generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a
high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with
part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to
enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an
objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of
generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that
Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional
accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic
detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and
future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles
and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object
detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image
backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate
differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance
of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges,
such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training
of ML models.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized
patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths
for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which
addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image.
APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes
in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT
achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput
by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and
can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1
epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss
of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\%
faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic
segmentation.

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a
fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians,
3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering
thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its
real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a
high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its
representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial
provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting
from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in
addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that
leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and
content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for
feed-forward pipelines.

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the
spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be
adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large
VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings.
Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly
fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment
domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online
In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a
stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse
demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built
on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for
which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage
of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our
method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher
test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to
dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD
method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using
scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's
zero-shot performance.

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency.
Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception
results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including
high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent
advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide
semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability
at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift
also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including
message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and
security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically,
we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection
disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection
forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline,
which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall,
language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by
an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We
systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32
critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious
attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides
guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy
language-driven collaboration in transportation systems. Our project page is

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space
exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in
this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations,
and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models,
trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery
and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue,
we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image
pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution
topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting
conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically
grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we
adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo.
We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface
reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant
improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale
generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack

VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense
optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering
categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,
and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations
from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within
densely crowded environments.

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate
diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex
visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical
application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities
simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this
limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality
detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and
hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is
precisely designed to support the development of models that produce
descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently,
we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M,
capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation.
RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs,
effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive
diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong
performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target
text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

Abstract: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with
radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound
videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and
heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes
well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable
predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce
\textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a
confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank,
providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design
preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while
rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset
(124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2)
to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by
29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp
datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2.
Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time
throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish
EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking,
bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of
interventional ultrasound. Codes are available here \hyperref[code

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and
language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where
benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to
distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to
problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We
present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework
to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity
classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.
Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we
construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.
Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint
understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear
unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when
joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most
critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur
despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further
demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still
responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find
that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline
content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of
under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to
53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text
understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical
test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language
safety.

Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object
detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation
diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the
biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating
more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance
frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii)
current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate
high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation
score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the
creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace
ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative
alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and
generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for
underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6
mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP
for layout accuracy in generated images.

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications
like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain
gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR
scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on
synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only
on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this
synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.
We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level
triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined
directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core
contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the
model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting
it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing
as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot
accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like
nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on
nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic
benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not
full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust
open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon
acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and

large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.
However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual
cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and
missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary
\textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware
Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature
Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and
Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view
features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art
results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing
baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and
generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.

Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the
latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues
with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed
human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance
improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using
attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these
issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent
information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the
network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local
(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components
of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent
frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent
information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain
features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,
with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction
learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing
the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction
methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through
dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces
computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority
compared to the most state-of-the-art.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the
Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related
to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated
learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation
across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)
problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This
motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in
federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,
we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting
from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a
hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology
to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a
parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces
mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness
against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy
during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and
personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature
similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the
tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the
advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these
challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two
fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access
to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens
to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing
approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill
unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage
framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable
latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects
tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing
per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per
frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in
4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,
keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments
demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$
lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.
StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods
with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS.
These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for
efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Identity preserving editing of faces is a generative task that enables
modifying the illumination, adding/removing eyeglasses, face aging, editing
hairstyles, modifying expression etc., while preserving the identity of the
face. Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic
editing of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in
GANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of
attributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view
consistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D
portrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents
a trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing
in high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints
in editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to
photorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on
recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing
techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing
for 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that
using just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to
estimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware
attribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with
masks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for
estimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits,
we investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use
the (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a
continuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances
pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with
stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting
relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to
scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth
estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models
(LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric
constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our
training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks
and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and
specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical
scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely
solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated
reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their
training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during
reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual
information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first
Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively
retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific
medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model
to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information
for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a
Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when
low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical
benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline
models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with
external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable
generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on
our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of
echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will
be made publicly available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/Med-RwR.

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various
modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for
biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from
general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how
image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and
demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly
improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training
and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)
mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these
findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and
mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative
impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three
core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are
typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,
imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we
introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that
addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM
jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D
occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon
auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic
Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level
signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video
generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with
external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to
directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,
while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through
occupancy-grounded rewards. Project page is available at

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive
results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question
answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating
descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially
mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but
challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model
independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble
Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates
hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference.
ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting
their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding
paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on
standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without
compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of
adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM
robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available at

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates
advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical
photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient
computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become
crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in
disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data
from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality
disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data
scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets
lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.
Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class
similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.
To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based
Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which
linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to
compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype
formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that
enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes
same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but
operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.
Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is
proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used
jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL
performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net
compared to existing approaches.

initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding
local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road
surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a
generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints,
providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network
removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method
achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

Abstract: Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image

knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually
assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets
is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the
training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative
pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale
web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces
crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks,
including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM).
During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to
pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable
image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various
facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression
recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of
face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation,
mask removal, and photo inpainting.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in
aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on
paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the
REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately
estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid
function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we
introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new
preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference
learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into
a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found
in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert
demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to
effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of
offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers
improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and
user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object
pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the
semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction
decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments
on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over
the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more
challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves
varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing
neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These
methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,
(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned
model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by
assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with
the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp
local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask
selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome
this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed
Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we
introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates
during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the
corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes
sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately
improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are
essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape
analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to
introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the
automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted
MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models
were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes
were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were
derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian
curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was
applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature
vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of
classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:
Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was
evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in
distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an
accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the
entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and
robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy
underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical
research applications.

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been
extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion
(HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on
disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the
arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral
structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent
advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have
partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into
higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure.
Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and
exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate
these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this
probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the
sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor
tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among
spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model
learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational
Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which
significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion
accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in
complex real-world scenarios.

models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.
Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers
into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain
parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a
corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential
performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set
of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are
implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of
the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific
function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet
enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled
DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training
from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,
highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our
method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas,
as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that
understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge
hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild
and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world
interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized
LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user
preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better
preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user
preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a
vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model
recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing
customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual
user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,
for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects
from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this
challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based
optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly
taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious
annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented
paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels
for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by
constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using
training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It
is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations
exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In
this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where
coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent
histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce
high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect
of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which
integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and
precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at

volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a
single mid-range GPU, significantly lowering the computational cost compared to
existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions,
enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental
results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to
anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating
global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach
supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of
varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or
healthcare professionals.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on
the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored
incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of
alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate
semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation
by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational
Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's
semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE
decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution
Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially
coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of
representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed
SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows
us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically
accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training
strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID
(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).
With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of
1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D
high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR)
videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging
problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach
based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian
representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need
for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The
second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines
the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal
luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the
HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new
evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video
reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR
significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art
methods in both rendering quality and speed.

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent
transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly
released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong
visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance
without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates
vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts
vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a
database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with
the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and
model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by
adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed
method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating
the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city
applications.

for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge
devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image
classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object
detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and
annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off
between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier,
EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency
(~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object
detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast
inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them
ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized
efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our
work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to
support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving
the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However,
failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose
predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose
estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from
multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query
image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation,
we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns
a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation
using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending
scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model
leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose
inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template
sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive
results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object
pose estimation.

Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under
various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud
feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across
diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer
from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global
features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias
that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than
distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for
in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering
different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor
placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively
circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust,
object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the
model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance
demonstrated in this challenge.

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under
adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or
environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets
inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable
controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple
sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how
perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse
conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes
Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the
camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of
occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For
radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement
three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation
of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of
perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.
By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and
reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,
resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims
to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference
images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models,
existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency
and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference
fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings
can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers
from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired
data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances.
In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is
suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline,
incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to
produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference
Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling
stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across
numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous
methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V
generation.

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently
outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D
representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,
particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model
reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely
used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,
neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is
especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which
further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can
be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.
To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which
applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a
considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by
proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep
learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages
cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a
progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the
network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of
the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network
and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in
model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for
fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the
best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of electron microscopy (EM) images of biological
samples remains a challenge in the life sciences. EM data captures details of
biological structures, sometimes with such complexity that even human observers
can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking,
sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior,
and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting
loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to
distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of
the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM
prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches
tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally,
instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a
MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent
embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on
2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of
our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that
{\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised
segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited
amounts of training labels are available.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic
Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization
approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that
approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ
leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while
maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two
experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization
(PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results
demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory
efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing
diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we
neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor
rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on
the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios,
respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight
the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient
matrix approximation and neural network compression.

based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated.
The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network
that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input
spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and
more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the
input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate

Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of
end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI),
a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles,
document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer.
These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human
experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing
and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully
curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process
by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments
show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,
document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in
the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different
combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and
post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and
feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform
poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch
representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one
end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,
despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in
building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that
improve performance in historical document writer identification.

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by
the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention
is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key
pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper
introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention
that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens
without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables
effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates
seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence
parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation
model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,
with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on
various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance
of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect
the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack
the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for
real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary
dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in
fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we
introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I
generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to
ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world
scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively
probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation
criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess
model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong
performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned
image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web
documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are
interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these
challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified
framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single
vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all
inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the
need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture
complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a
snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal
segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring
explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this
approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,
designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential
understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical
results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such
as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web
data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate
the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal
representation learning. Code and models are available at:

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,
thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,
despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do
not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate
motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume
in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix
defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling
capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion
modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,
with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In
EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume
style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based
neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the
constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for
appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling
as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four
widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,
Something-Something V1 & V2.

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality
images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing
computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache
compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains
largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by
identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term
spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we
introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the
KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into
two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short
recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a
compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a
notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual
quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image
generation on resource-constrained hardware.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
instruction-following fidelity.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time
view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual
colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static
illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,
which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic
scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS
methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the
camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately
degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the
illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical
characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an
improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance
under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with
two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt
to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the
geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved
Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian
geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is
leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.
Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and
accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while
significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).
Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled
images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing
approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually
designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and
scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware
hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and
easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a
Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits
hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the
limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives
equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed
to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,
including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and
further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets. Project page:

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually
compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,
entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion
transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs
(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention
mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational
bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)
impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we
present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient
and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,
UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on
global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a
local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global
attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a
spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global
dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to
reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different
local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively
scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution
for the first time, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods and
super-resolution based two-stage pipelines in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

Abstract: A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained
once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene
retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and
robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of
spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework
for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student
paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial
branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary
spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning
strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via
reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and
(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized
using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining
reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework
enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free
and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.
Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements
over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,
confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary
learning paradigm. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77
tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform
fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks
support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict
its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have
attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to
enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and
fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces
of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently
without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can
disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,
leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.
To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based
progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP
image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills
knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage
CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between
the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns
the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text
contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid
overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment
loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation
inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in

the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial

challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are
costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which
enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two
supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of
98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and
a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly
outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model
bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise
for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given

different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and
heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which
limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and
parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model
towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,
to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various
task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify
diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory
matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory
mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we
introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any
granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich
annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which
represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified
tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++
sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different
granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
of our unified framework and model design.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and
privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often
hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale
vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification
capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across
domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated
prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in
multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:
(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by
label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features
in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased
mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt
aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt
and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)
To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the
generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the
two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.
Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for
federated image recognition across multiple domains.

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,

meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts
effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword
tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While
effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource
languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating
computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move
toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images
(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,
reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale
multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or
surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and
reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,
robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a
shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step
toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
benchmarks.

requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object
inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in
isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce
Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.
Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports
(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally
achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form
questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to
active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a
more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple
regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains
the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5
on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple
prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B
on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong
capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

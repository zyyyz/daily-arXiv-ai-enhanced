We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),\nperitubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its\nconstituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current\nsegmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs\nare mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert\nguidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings\nhighlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including\nstructural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final\nscores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate\nrepresentations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the\nlimitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level\ngrading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational\nBanff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant\npathology."}

To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,\nlarge language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption\nquality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage\nprocess. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated\nusing a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The\nLLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key\nobjects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly\ndetected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,\nregion-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process\nenriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to\nundetected objects.

To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures.

However, it remains\nchallenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences\nbecause of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,\nwe propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework\nthat handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across\ndiverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer\narchitecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still\nenabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent\nnoise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This\ndesign enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional\nmanner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the\ndecoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling\nmethod that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve\nasynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks\nsuch as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,\nwhile our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On\nreal-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by\n13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training\non action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on\nRoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining."}

A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when\napplied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize\nthat leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and\nbranching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To\ninvestigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating\nlarge-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in\nsegmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular\ngeometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,\nencouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate\nthat a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot\nsegmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,\nrequiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model\nexhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in\nunseen domains without any target-specific training.

Immutable\nheterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as\nparticipating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This\nleads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,\nconsequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all\nagents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training\ncost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as\nthe representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with\nsignificant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper\nalignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method\nbased on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator\nduring training to derive the common representation from the local\nrepresentations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent\ndomain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual\ntransformation of features between the local representation space and the\ncommon representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To\nbetter align local representations to the common representation containing\nmultimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic\nalignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the\ntraining.

Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the\nmost commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a\nsimilarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of\ntheir sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent\nstudies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for\nmeasuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we\nhave observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which\nnegatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when\nused as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes\nleads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).\nThrough analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD\nnot only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,\nwhich enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the\nAI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box\nregression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various detectors.

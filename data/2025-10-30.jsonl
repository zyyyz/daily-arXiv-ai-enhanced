Our contributions\nto this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the\nimpact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a\nnew approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are\ngrounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic\ndatasets.

Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a\ndiscrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid\nformulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the\nbiological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class\nboundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity\nestimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel\narchitectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,\nRT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the\nmodel to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each\ndetected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its\nassociated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream\ndecision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like\nselective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more\nbiologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains\nexceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of\n85.6\\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset.

However, the\npursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to\ndegraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements\nand practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective\nand highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving\ncapabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object\ndetectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective\ndisparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable\nand task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one\nhand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the\nintegration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the\ndetector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation\n(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer\nbased on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference\noverhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance\ngains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for\nreal-time detection.

However, most previous methods\nusually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects\nand gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both\nthe training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an\nauxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization\nacross the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this\nend, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and\ngaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors\nduring inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded\nspecific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,\nwhich extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using\nthe shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared\nbackbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain\nhead-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head\ndetection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing\nthe gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense\nfeature and gaze feature with the help of head location.

The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling\nspace, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model\noutputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial\nstructure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local\ndependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach\nthat harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model\ntoward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on\nmultiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR\nmodels, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity."}

Large\nmultimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and\nreason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,\nsystematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain\nlimited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal\nspatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for\nevaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on\npost-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D\ntasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout\nunderstanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.\nWe also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation\nand action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio\nand egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through\nnew sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers\ninsights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning.

Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on\noptimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision\nor on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric\napproximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D\ngeneration of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with\nthe advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending\nthese methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models\nposes significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a\ntraining-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of\ntraining a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a\npre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape\nprior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by\ntreating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images\ncaptured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the\nobject's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring\ntask-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our\nmethod generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts\nunderlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object\ncategories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D\ncompletes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art\napproaches in both quality and versatility."}

Prevailing\nmethods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is\nresource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen\neffects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video\ngeneration. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,\nenabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto\ntarget content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to\nunseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning\nstrategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context\nattention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential\neffect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect\nimitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient\none-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on\ntough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories\nof effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain\neffects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a\ncomprehensive dataset to the community."}

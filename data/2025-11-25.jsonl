This study evaluates the feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) models as low-cost alternatives using frontal body images and basic anthropometric data. The dataset consists of 535 samples: 253 cases with recorded anthropometric measurements (weight, height, neck, ankle, and wrist) and 282 images obtained via web scraping from Reddit posts with self-reported body fat percentages, including some reported as DEXA-derived by the original posters. Because no public datasets exist for computer-vision-based body fat estimation, this dataset was compiled specifically for this study. Two approaches were developed: (1) ResNet-based image models and (2) regression models using anthropometric measurements. A multimodal fusion framework is also outlined for future expansion once paired datasets become available. The image-based model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.44% and a Coefficient of Determination (R^2) of 0.807. These findings demonstrate that AI-assisted models can offer accessible and low-cost body fat estimates, supporting future consumer applications in health and fitness."}

In this work, we propose a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) that learns unified representations across text, audio, and visual data, enabling end-to-end automation of metadata extraction and semantic clustering. The model is trained on the recently introduced LUMA dataset, a fully aligned benchmark of multimodal triplets representative of real-world media content. By minimizing joint reconstruction losses across modalities, the MMAE discovers modality-invariant semantic structures without relying on large paired or contrastive datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) compared to linear baselines, indicating that reconstruction-based multimodal embeddings can serve as a foundation for scalable metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval in broadcast archives. These results highlight the potential of reconstruction-driven multimodal learning to enhance automation, searchability, and content management efficiency in modern broadcast workflows."}

Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks."}

By leveraging human-annotated ground-truth 2D, our proposed method, a multi-camera single-object tracking algorithm, transforms 2D image coordinates into robust 3D world coordinates through homography-based projection and UKF-based fusion. Our proposed algorithm processes multi-view data to estimate object positions and shapes while effectively handling challenges such as occlusion. We evaluate our method on the CMC, Wildtrack, and Panoptic datasets, demonstrating high accuracy in 3D localization compared to the available 3D ground truth. Unlike existing approaches that provide only ground-plane information, our method also outputs the full 3D shape of each object.

Nighttime and dimly lit traffic scenes often suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare from vehicle headlights or street lamps, which hinder tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a fully unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for low-light traffic image enhancement. The model decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, progressively refined by three specialized modules: (1) Illumination Adaptation, for global and local brightness correction; (2) Reflectance Restoration, for noise suppression and structural detail recovery using spatial-channel attention; and (3) Over-Exposure Compensation, for reconstructing saturated regions and balancing scene luminance. The network is trained using self-supervised reconstruction, reflectance smoothness, perceptual consistency, and domain-aware regularization losses, eliminating the need for paired ground-truth images. Experiments on general and traffic-specific datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE) and qualitative visual quality. Our approach enhances visibility, preserves structure, and improves downstream perception reliability in real-world low-light traffic scenarios."}

Self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning can mitigate the data scarcity challenge to some extent. However, both of these paradigms are complex and require either hand-crafted pretexts or well-defined pseudo-labels. In contrast, data augmentation represents a relatively simple and straightforward approach to addressing data scarcity issues. It has led to significant improvements in image recognition tasks. However, the effectiveness of local image editing augmentation techniques in the context of segmentation has been less explored. We propose HSMix, a novel approach to local image editing data augmentation involving hard and soft mixing for medical semantic segmentation. In our approach, a hard-augmented image is created by combining homogeneous regions (superpixels) from two source images. A soft mixing method further adjusts the brightness of these composed regions with brightness mixing based on locally aggregated pixel-wise saliency coefficients. The ground-truth segmentation masks of the two source images undergo the same mixing operations to generate the associated masks for the augmented images. Our method fully exploits both the prior contour and saliency information, thus preserving local semantic information in the augmented images while enriching the augmentation space with more diversity. Our method is a plug-and-play solution that is model agnostic and applicable to a range of medical imaging modalities. Extensive experimental evidence has demonstrated its effectiveness in a variety of medical segmentation tasks. The source code is available in https://github.com/DanielaPlusPlus/HSMix."}

To address this limitation, we introduce plug-and-play multi-concept adaptive blending for high-fidelity text-to-image synthesis (PnP-MIX), an innovative, tuning-free approach designed to seamlessly embed multiple personalized concepts into a single generated image. Our method leverages guided appearance attention to faithfully reflect the intended appearance of each personalized concept. To further enhance compositional fidelity, we present a mask-guided noise mixing strategy that preserves the integrity of non-personalized regions such as the background or unrelated objects while enabling the precise integration of personalized objects. Finally, to mitigate concept leakage, i.e., the inadvertent leakage of personalized concept features into other regions, we propose background dilution++, a novel strategy that effectively reduces such leakage and promotes accurate localization of features within personalized regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PnP-MIX consistently surpasses existing methodologies in both single- and multi-concept personalization scenarios, underscoring its robustness and superior performance without additional model tuning."}

In this paper, we introduce Foundational Question Generation for Video Question Answering via an Embedding-Integrated Approach (FIQ), a framework designed to enhance the reasoning capability of VQA models by improving their foundational comprehension of video content. FIQ generates Q&A pairs from descriptive information extracted directly from videos, thereby enriching the dataset with core scene-level attributes. These generated pairs help the model develop a more holistic understanding of the video, leading to improved generalizability and reasoning performance. In addition, we propose a VQ-CAlign module that aligns task-specific question embeddings with corresponding visual features, preserving essential contextual cues and enhancing adaptability to downstream tasks. Experimental results on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset demonstrate that FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baseline approaches."}

To circumvent this limitation, we revisit bounding box representation and propose corner-aligned regression, which shifts the prediction target from unstable centers to geometrically informative corners that reside in dense, observable regions. Leveraging the inherent geometric constraints among corners and image 2D boxes, partial parameters of 3D bounding boxes can be recovered from corner annotations, enabling a weakly supervised paradigm without requiring complete 3D labels. We design a simple yet effective corner-aware detection head that can be plugged into existing detectors. Experiments on KITTI show our method improves performance by 3.5% AP over center-based baseline, and achieves 83% of fully supervised accuracy using only BEV corner clicks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our corner-aware regression strategy."}

However, existing methods apply activation rectification while often overlooking channel's intrinsic characteristics and distributional skewness, which results in inaccurate typical set estimation. This discrepancy can lead to the improper inclusion of anomalous activations across channels. To address this limitation, we propose a typical set refinement method based on discriminability and activity, which rectifies activations into a channel-aware typical set.

RMOT benchmarks only describe the object's appearance, relative positions, and initial motion states. This so-called static regulation fails to capture dynamic changes of the object motion, including velocity changes and motion direction shifts. This limitation not only causes a temporal discrepancy between static references and dynamic vision modality but also constrains multi-modal tracking performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Vision-Motion-Reference aligned RMOT framework, named VMRMOT. It integrates a motion modality extracted from object dynamics to enhance the alignment between vision modality and language references through multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we introduce motion-aware descriptions derived from object dynamic behaviors and, leveraging the powerful temporal-reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, extract motion features as the motion modality. We further design a Vision-Motion-Reference Alignment (VMRA) module to hierarchically align visual queries with motion and reference cues, enhancing their cross-modal consistency. In addition, a Motion-Guided Prediction Head (MGPH) is developed to explore motion modality to enhance the performance of the prediction head. To the best of our knowledge, VMRMOT is the first approach to employ MLLMs in the RMOT task for vision-reference alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple RMOT benchmarks demonstrate that VMRMOT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions. Overall, counting emerges as a structured, layerwise process in LLMs and follows the same general pattern in LVLMs, shaped by the properties of the vision encoder."}

A Synthetic Benchmark and Analysis of Attention-Based Interventions", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent research suggests that Vision Language Models (VLMs) often rely on inherent biases learned during training when responding to queries about visual properties of images. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly specific questions that require them to focus on particular areas of the image in tasks such as counting. We build upon this research by developing a synthetic benchmark dataset and evaluation framework to systematically determine how counting performance varies as image and prompt properties change. Using open-source VLMs, we then analyze how attention allocation fluctuates with varying input parameters (e.g. number of objects in the image, objects color, background color, objects texture, background texture, and prompt specificity). We further implement attention-based interventions to modulate focus on visual tokens at different layers and evaluate their impact on counting performance across a range of visual conditions. Our experiments reveal that while VLM counting performance remains challenging, especially under high visual or linguistic complexity, certain attention interventions can lead to modest gains in counting performance."}

Segmentation of coronary vessels from XCA can facilitate downstream quantitative assessments, such as measurement of the stenosis severity and enhancing clinical decision-making. However, developing generalizable vessel segmentation models for XCA is challenging due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics that cause domain shifts. These limitations are exacerbated by the lack of annotated datasets, making Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) a necessary solution for achieving generalization. Existing SDG methods are largely augmentation-based, which may not guarantee the mitigation of overfitting to augmented or synthetic domains. We propose a novel approach, ``AngioDG\", to bridge this gap by channel regularization strategy to promote generalization. Our method identifies the contributions of early feature channels to task-specific metrics for DG, facilitating interpretability, and then reweights channels to calibrate and amplify domain-invariant features while attenuating domain-specific ones. We evaluate AngioDG on 6 x-ray angiography datasets for coronary vessels segmentation, achieving the best out-of-distribution performance among the compared methods, while maintaining consistent in-domain test performance."}

Here, we apply VLMs to two fundamental challenges in data-driven stroke rehabilitation: automatic quantification of rehabilitation dose and impairment from videos. We formulate these problems as motion-identification tasks, which can be addressed using VLMs. We evaluate our proposed framework on a cohort of 29 healthy controls and 51 stroke survivors. Our results show that current VLMs lack the fine-grained motion understanding required for precise quantification: dose estimates are comparable to a baseline that excludes visual information, and impairment scores cannot be reliably predicted. Nevertheless, several findings suggest future promise. With optimized prompting and post-processing, VLMs can classify high-level activities from a few frames, detect motion and grasp with moderate accuracy, and approximate dose counts within 25% of ground truth for mildly impaired and healthy participants, all without task-specific training or finetuning. These results highlight both the current limitations and emerging opportunities of VLMs for data-driven stroke rehabilitation and broader clinical video analysis."}

Yet, its potential in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains largely untapped, hindered by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the rich, spatially grounded reasoning intrinsic to visual understanding. Existing visual-CoT resources are typically small, domain-specific, or lack the human-like stepwise structure necessary for compositional visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisReason, a large-scale dataset designed to advance visual Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VisReason comprises 489K annotated examples spanning four diverse domains, each featuring multi-round, human-like rationales that guide MLLMs through interpretable visual reasoning steps. Building upon this, we curate VisReason-Pro, a 165K subset produced with a stronger expert-level GPT annotator, enriched with detailed reasoning traces and 3D spatial grounding via depth-informed annotations. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art Qwen2.5-VL model on VisReason and VisReason-Pro yields substantial improvements in step-by-step visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and cross-benchmark generalization. These results demonstrate that VisReason equips MLLMs with more systematic and generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Large-scale, weakly-supervised datasets in language and vision have driven the development of foundation models whose internal representations encode structure (patterns, co-occurrences and statistical regularities) beyond their training objectives. Most existing methods extract structure only for pre-specified targets; they excel at confirmation but do not support open-ended discovery of unknown patterns. We ask whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can enable open-ended feature discovery from foundation model representations. We evaluate this question in controlled rediscovery studies, where the learned SAE features are tested for alignment with semantic concepts on a standard segmentation benchmark and compared against strong label-free alternatives on concept-alignment metrics. Applied to ecological imagery, the same procedure surfaces fine-grained anatomical structure without access to segmentation or part labels, providing a scientific case study with ground-truth validation. While our experiments focus on vision with an ecology case study, the method is domain-agnostic and applicable to models in other sciences (e.g., proteins, genomics, weather). Our results indicate that sparse decomposition provides a practical instrument for exploring what scientific foundation models have learned, an important prerequisite for moving from confirmation to genuine discovery."}

To address this, we present AEGIS, the first privacy-preserving identity masking framework for 3D Gaussian Avatars that maintains the subject's perceived characteristics. Our method aims to conceal identity-related facial features while preserving the avatar's perceptual realism and functional integrity. AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to the Gaussian color coefficients, guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying the avatar's geometry. AEGIS achieves complete de-identification, reducing face retrieval and verification accuracy to 0%, while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB). It also preserves key facial attributes such as age, race, gender, and emotion, demonstrating strong privacy protection with minimal visual distortion."}

However, unconstrained feature matching across domains such as aerial, indoor, and outdoor scenes remains challenging due to large variations in appearance, scale and viewpoint. Feature matching has been conventionally formulated as a 2D-to-2D problem; however, recent 3D foundation models provides spatial feature matching properties based on two-view geometry. While powerful, we observe that these spatially coherent matches often concentrate on dominant planar regions, e.g., walls or ground surfaces, while being less sensitive to fine-grained geometric details, particularly under large viewpoint changes. To better understand these trade-offs, we first perform linear probe experiments to evaluate the performance of various vision foundation models for image matching. Building on these insights, we introduce SPIDER, a universal feature matching framework that integrates a shared feature extraction backbone with two specialized network heads for estimating both 2D-based and 3D-based correspondences from coarse to fine. Finally, we introduce an image-matching evaluation benchmark that focuses on unconstrained scenarios with large baselines. SPIDER significantly outperforms SoTA methods, demonstrating its strong ability as a universal image-matching method."}

Therefore, we present CORA, a semi-supervised reasoning segmentation framework that jointly learns from limited labeled data and a large corpus of unlabeled images. CORA introduces three main components: 1) conditional visual instructions that encode spatial and contextual relationships between objects; 2) a noisy pseudo-label filter based on the consistency of Multimodal LLM's outputs across semantically equivalent queries; and 3) a token-level contrastive alignment between labeled and pseudo-labeled samples to enhance feature consistency. These components enable CORA to perform robust reasoning segmentation with minimal supervision, outperforming existing baselines under constrained annotation settings. CORA achieves state-of-the-art results, requiring as few as 100 labeled images on Cityscapes, a benchmark dataset for urban scene understanding, surpassing the baseline by $+2.3\\%$. Similarly, CORA improves performance by $+2.4\\%$ with only 180 labeled images on PanNuke, a histopathology dataset."}

To address this challenge, we propose the Latent Dirichlet Transformer Variational Autoencoder (LDVAE-T) for hyperspectral unmixing. Our model combines the global context modeling capabilities of transformer architectures with physically meaningful constraints imposed by a Dirichlet prior in the latent space. This prior naturally enforces the sum-to-one and non-negativity conditions essential for abundance estimation, thereby improving the quality of predicted mixing ratios. A key contribution of LDVAE-T is its treatment of materials as bundled endmembers, rather than relying on fixed ground truth spectra. In the proposed method our decoder predicts, for each endmember and each patch, a mean spectrum together with a structured (segmentwise) covariance that captures correlated spectral variability. Reconstructions are formed by mixing these learned bundles with Dirichlet-distributed abundances garnered from a transformer encoder, allowing the model to represent intrinsic material variability while preserving physical interpretability. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, Samson, Jasper Ridge, and HYDICE Urban and show that LDVAE-T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in abundance estimation and endmember extraction, as measured by root mean squared error and spectral angle distance, respectively."}

In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) for detecting AI-generated satellite images. Using a curated dataset of over 130,000 labeled RGB images from the DM-AER and FSI datasets, we show that ViTs significantly outperform CNNs in both accuracy (95.11 percent vs. 87.02 percent) and overall robustness, owing to their ability to model long-range dependencies and global semantic structures. We further enhance model transparency using architecture-specific interpretability methods, including Grad-CAM for CNNs and Chefer's attention attribution for ViTs, revealing distinct detection behaviors and validating model trustworthiness. Our results highlight the ViT's superior performance in detecting structural inconsistencies and repetitive textural patterns characteristic of synthetic imagery.

To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model.

To balance diversity and quality, we introduce a score-based regularization for the diversity mechanism, which uses the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log probability, to ensure samples are pushed apart within high-density regions of the data manifold, mitigating off-manifold drift. We further develop the first approach for importance weighting of non-IID flow samples by learning a residual velocity field that reproduces the marginal distribution of the non-IID samples.

Notably, this unification brings dual benefits: the spatial knowledge gained through video pretraining enhances contextual consistency and realism in non-rigid image edits, while the instruction-guided manipulation stage equips the model with stronger goal-oriented reasoning for video prediction. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms expert models in both instructional image and video generation, highlighting the strength of video diffusion models as a unified action-object state transformer."}

However, its practicality is severely constrained by the limited communication bandwidth. Existing approaches attempt to improve bandwidth efficiency via compression or heuristic message selection, without considering the semantic relevance or cross-agent redundancy of sensory data. We argue that a practical CP system must maximize the contribution of every transmitted bit to the final perception task, by extracting and transmitting semantically essential and non-redundant data. In this paper, we formulate a joint semantic feature encoding and transmission problem, which aims to maximize CP accuracy under limited bandwidth. To solve this problem, we introduce JigsawComm, an end-to-end trained, semantic-aware, and communication-efficient CP framework that learns to ``assemble the puzzle'' of multi-agent feature transmission. It uses a regularized encoder to extract semantically-relevant and sparse features, and a lightweight Feature Utility Estimator to predict the contribution of each agent's features to the final perception task. The resulting meta utility maps are exchanged among agents and leveraged to compute a provably optimal transmission policy, which selects features from agents with the highest utility score for each location. This policy inherently eliminates redundancy and achieves a scalable $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ communication cost as the number of agents increases.

In this work, we present the first systematic study of distillation across a range of CLIP-style teacher models, ranging from standard baselines to large-scale state-of-the-art models.

To address these limitations, we propose Mask-Integrated Negative Attention Diffusion (MINDiff). MINDiff introduces a novel concept, negative attention, which suppresses the subject's influence in masked irrelevant regions. We achieve this by modifying the cross-attention mechanism during inference. This enables semantic control and improves text alignment by reducing subject dominance in irrelevant regions. Additionally, during the inference time, users can adjust a scale parameter lambda to balance subject fidelity and text alignment. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments on DreamBooth models demonstrate that MINDiff mitigates overfitting more effectively than class-specific prior-preservation loss.

We propose Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR), which reformulates the 3DGS training objective, thereby guiding 3DGS to converge toward a better generalization solution. Although Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) similarly reduces the sharpness of the loss landscape to improve generalization of classification models, directly employing it to 3DGS is suboptimal due to the discrepancy between the tasks. Specifically, it hinders reconstructing high-frequency details due to excessive regularization, while reducing its strength leads to under-penalizing sharpness. To address this, we reflect the local frequency of images to set the regularization weight and the neighborhood radius when estimating the local sharpness. It prevents floater artifacts in novel viewpoints and reconstructs fine details that SAM tends to oversmooth.

With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning. PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS."}

Recent Structured State-Space Models such as Mamba have demonstrated potential in TAD due to their long-range modeling capability and linear computational complexity.

Additionally, traditional methods for TAD struggle with detecting long-span action instances due to a lack of global awareness and inefficient detection heads. This paper presents MambaTAD, a new state-space TAD model that introduces long-range modeling and global feature detection capabilities for accurate temporal action detection. MambaTAD comprises two novel designs that complement each other with superior TAD performance. First, it introduces a Diagonal-Masked Bidirectional State-Space (DMBSS) module which effectively facilitates global feature fusion and temporal action detection. Second, it introduces a global feature fusion head that refines the detection progressively with multi-granularity features and global awareness. In addition, MambaTAD tackles TAD in an end-to-end one-stage manner using a new state-space temporal adapter(SSTA) which reduces network parameters and computation cost with linear complexity.

Change detection tasks exist with different output granularities such as BCD, SCD, and BDA. However, existing methods require substantial expert knowledge to design specialized decoders that compensate for information loss during encoding across different tasks. This not only introduces uncertainty into the process of selecting optimal models for abrupt change scenarios (such as disaster outbreaks) but also limits the universality of these architectures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, general change detection framework named UniRSCD. Building upon a state space model backbone, we introduce a frequency change prompt generator as a unified encoder. The encoder dynamically scans bitemporal global context information while integrating high-frequency details with low-frequency holistic information, thereby eliminating the need for specialized decoders for feature compensation. Subsequently, the unified decoder and prediction head establish a shared representation space through hierarchical feature interaction and task-adaptive output mapping. This integrating various tasks such as binary change detection and semantic change detection into a unified architecture, thereby accommodating the differing output granularity requirements of distinct change detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture can adapt to multiple change detection tasks and achieves leading performance on five datasets, including the binary change dataset LEVIR-CD, the semantic change dataset SECOND, and the building damage assessment dataset xBD."}

In this paper, we propose Test-Time Temporal Sampling (T3S), a training-free, plug-and-play inference wrapper that enables MLLMs to process long videos both efficiently and effectively. T3S exploits spatiotemporal redundancy by generating multiple short and diverse subsequences of video tokens at inference time, packing them within a single forward pass, and aggregating their predictions. This multi-subsequence formulation broadens visual coverage while reducing the computational cost of self-attention from $O(L^2)$ to $O(\\sum_{i=1}^m α_i^2L^2)$, where $\\sum_{i=1}^m α_i^2 < 1$. Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that T3S improves accuracy by up to 3.1% and reduces first token delay by $2.04\\times$, all with minimal integration effort. Our approach operates entirely at inference time, requires no model modifications or fine-tuning, and is compatible with a wide range of pretrained MLLMs. T3S turns video redundancy into a computational advantage, offering a scalable solution for long-video understanding.

Our quantitative analysis of cross-modal attention inside state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a core failure mode: in multi-speaker scenes, visual and textual tokens lack speaker-consistent alignment, exhibiting substantially weaker cross-modal attention than in object-centric images. To address this, we propose a multimodal multi-speaker attention alignment method that can be integrated into existing MLLMs. First, we introduce dynamic cross-modal head selection to identify attention heads most responsible for grounding. Then, an adaptive social-aware attention bias, computed from existing attention patterns and speaker locations, is injected into the attention mechanism. This bias reinforces alignment between a speaker's visual representation and their utterances without introducing trainable parameters or architectural changes. We integrate our method into three distinct MLLMs (LLaVA-NeXT-Video, Qwen2.5-VL, and InternVL3) and evaluate on three benchmarks (TVQA+, MMSI, OnlineMMSI).

SFUDA addresses the domain shift by adapting models from the source domain to the unseen target domain without accessing source data, even when target-domain labels are unavailable.

To address these issues, we propose HEAL, a novel SFUDA framework that integrates Hierarchical denoising, Edge-guided selection, size-Aware fusion, and Learning-free characteristic.

In this paper, we introduce adversarial pseudo-replay (APR), a method that perturbs the images of the new task with adversarial attack, to synthesize the pseudo-replay images online without storing any replay samples. During the new task training, the adversarial attack is conducted on the new task images with augmented old class mean prototypes as targets, and the resulting images are used for knowledge distillation to prevent semantic drift. Moreover, we calibrate the covariance matrices to compensate for the semantic drift after each task, by learning a transfer matrix on the pseudo-replay samples.

Building upon this observation, we propose FeRA, a frequency driven fine tuning framework that aligns parameter updates with the intrinsic frequency energy progression of diffusion. FeRA establishes a comprehensive frequency energy framework for effective diffusion adaptation fine tuning, comprising three synergistic components: (i) a compact frequency energy indicator that characterizes the latent bandwise energy distribution, (ii) a soft frequency router that adaptively fuses multiple frequency specific adapter experts, and (iii) a frequency energy consistency regularization that stabilizes diffusion optimization and ensures coherent adaptation across bands. Routing operates in both training and inference, with inference time routing dynamically determined by the latent frequency energy. It integrates seamlessly with adapter based tuning schemes and generalizes well across diffusion backbones and resolutions. By aligning adaptation with the frequency energy mechanism, FeRA provides a simple, stable, and compatible paradigm for effective and robust diffusion model adaptation."}

To address these challenges, we propose Plan-X, a framework that explicitly enforces high-level semantic planning to instruct video generation process. At its core lies a Semantic Planner, a learnable multimodal language model that reasons over the user's intent from both text prompts and visual context, and autoregressively generates a sequence of text-grounded spatio-temporal semantic tokens. These semantic tokens, complementary to high-level text prompt guidance, serve as structured \"semantic sketches\" over time for the video diffusion model, which has its strength at synthesizing high-fidelity visual details. Plan-X effectively integrates the strength of language models in multimodal in-context reasoning and planning, together with the strength of diffusion models in photorealistic video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially reduces visual hallucinations and enables fine-grained, instruction-aligned video generation consistent with multimodal context."}

Understanding Active Learning in Longitudinal Medical Imaging", "comment": "This paper has been accepted at International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025", "summary": "Detecting changes in longitudinal medical imaging using deep learning requires a substantial amount of accurately labeled data. However, labeling these images is notably more costly and time-consuming than labeling other image types, as it requires labeling across various time points, where new lesions can be minor, and subtle changes are easily missed. Deep Active Learning (DAL) has shown promise in minimizing labeling costs by selectively querying the most informative samples, but existing studies have primarily focused on static tasks like classification and segmentation. Consequently, the conventional DAL approach cannot be directly applied to change detection tasks, which involve identifying subtle differences across multiple images. In this study, we propose a novel DAL framework, named Longitudinal Medical Imaging Active Learning (LMI-AL), tailored specifically for longitudinal medical imaging. By pairing and differencing all 2D slices from baseline and follow-up 3D images, LMI-AL iteratively selects the most informative pairs for labeling using DAL, training a deep learning model with minimal manual annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that, with less than 8% of the data labeled, LMI-AL can achieve performance comparable to models trained on fully labeled datasets. We also provide a detailed analysis of the method's performance, as guidance for future research. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HelenMa9998/Longitudinal_AL."}

To fill this gap, we focus primarily on road markings as a typical example of fine-grained spatial elements under urban scenarios, given the essential role of the integrated road traffic network they form within cities. Around road markings and urban traffic systems, we propose RoadBench, a systematic benchmark that comprehensively evaluates MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities using BEV and FPV image inputs. This benchmark comprises six tasks consisting of 9,121 strictly manually verified test cases. These tasks form a systematic evaluation framework that bridges understanding at local spatial scopes to global reasoning. They not only test MLLMs' capabilities in recognition, joint understanding, and reasoning but also assess their ability to integrate image information with domain knowledge. After evaluating 14 mainstream MLLMs, we confirm that RoadBench is a challenging benchmark for MLLMs while revealing significant shortcomings in existing MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities within urban scenarios. In certain tasks, their performance even falls short of simple rule-based or random selection baselines. These findings, along with RoadBench itself, will contribute to the comprehensive advancement of spatial understanding capabilities for MLLMs. The benchmark code, example datasets, and raw evaluation results are available in the supplementary material."}

First, existing semantic prototypes, even when enriched by LLMs, are static and limited, failing to capture the rich intra-class visual variations induced by different object states (e.g., a cat's pose). Second, the standard pseudo-box generation introduces a semantic mismatch between visual region proposals (which contain context) and object-centric text embeddings. To tackle these issues, we introduce two complementary prototype enhancement strategies. To capture intra-class variations in appearance and state, we propose the State-Enhanced Semantic Prototypes (SESP), which generates state-aware textual descriptions (e.g., \"a sleeping cat\") to capture diverse object appearances, yielding more discriminative prototypes. Building on this, we further introduce Scene-Augmented Pseudo Prototypes (SAPP) to address the semantic mismatch. SAPP incorporates contextual semantics (e.g., \"cat lying on sofa\") and utilizes a soft alignment mechanism to promote contextually consistent visual-textual representations. By integrating SESP and SAPP, our method effectively enhances both the richness of semantic prototypes and the visual-textual alignment, achieving notable improvements."}

Nonetheless, its fixed linear mapper is limited by a narrow receptive field and restricted flexibility, which hampers its effectiveness in fine-grained images. To address this, we created a nonlinear state predictive control model \\textbf{MambaX} that maps consecutive spectral bands into a latent state space and generalizes the SR task by dynamically learning the nonlinear state parameters of control equations. Compared to existing sequence models, MambaX 1) employs dynamic state predictive control learning to approximate the nonlinear differential coefficients of state-space models; 2) introduces a novel state cross-control paradigm for multimodal SR fusion; and 3) utilizes progressive transitional learning to mitigate heterogeneity caused by domain and modality shifts. Our evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of the dynamic spectrum-state representation model in both single-image SR and multimodal fusion-based SR tasks, highlighting its substantial potential to advance spectrally generalized modeling across arbitrary dimensions and modalities."}

Guided by the refined representations and uncertainty cues of unlabeled samples, HAL then conducts sample querying through a progressive clustering strategy, selecting the most informative instances that jointly satisfy the criteria of scalability, diversity, and uncertainty. This hierarchical process ensures both efficiency and representativeness in sample selection. Extensive experiments on three benchmark RS scene classification datasets, including UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, demonstrate that HSSAL consistently outperforms SSL- or AL-only baselines. Remarkably, with only 8%, 4%, and 2% labeled training data on UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, respectively, HSSAL achieves over 95% of fully-supervised accuracy, highlighting its superior label efficiency through informativeness exploitation of unlabeled data. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/RS-SSAL."}

All images underwent Macenko stain normalization and patch-based preprocessing to enhance morphological feature representation. An EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network was trained using class-balanced sampling and focal loss to address dataset imbalance and emphasize difficult examples. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.7323, with an F1-score of 0.75 for the Abnormal class and 0.71 for the Normal class. Grad-CAM heatmaps demonstrated biologically interpretable activation patterns, highlighting nuclear atypia and glandular crowding consistent with AIS morphology.

We introduce the Extracted Morphological Feature Engineered (EMFE) pipeline, a transparent, reproducible, and low compute machine learning approach tailored explicitly for simple cell morphology, designed to achieve deep learning performance levels on a simple CPU only setup with the practical aim of real world deployment.\n  Methods: The study used the NIH Malaria Cell Images dataset, with two features extracted from each cell image: the number of non background pixels and the number of holes within the cell. Logistic Regression and Random Forest were compared against ResNet18, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet across accuracy, model size, and CPU inference time.

The Apart stage maximizes representational diversity through modality anchors and a contrastive regularizer that preserve unique modality information and prevent feature collapse.

We address this gap by introducing Spotlight, a novel task aimed at localizing and explaining video-generation errors. We generate 600 videos using 200 diverse textual prompts and three state-of-the-art video generators (Veo 3, Seedance, and LTX-2), and annotate over 1600 fine-grained errors across six types, including motion, physics, and prompt adherence. We observe that adherence and physics errors are predominant and persist across longer segments, whereas appearance-disappearance and body pose errors manifest in shorter segments. We then evaluate current VLMs on Spotlight and find that VLMs lag significantly behind humans in error identification and localization in videos. We propose inference-time strategies to probe the limits of current VLMs on our task, improving performance by nearly 2x.

Our approach consists of two innovative branches and a Unified Multimodal Learning (UML) module.

To integrate multimodal representations into a coherent space, a UML module is introduced to consolidate the generalization ability of MM-Det++.

Our framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of MVS methods with minimal architectural changes.

Moreover, the fidelity of visual replacements hinges on how precisely the instruction references the target semantics. We revisit this challenge through the lens of temporal modeling: if video can be regarded as a full temporal process, then image editing can be seen as a degenerate temporal process.

MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, our design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods, serving as a plug-and-play framework. Code will be released."}

While explainable AI has advanced significantly in standard computer vision tasks, interpretability in FSS remains virtually unexplored despite its critical importance for understanding model behavior and guiding support set selection in data-scarce scenarios. This paper introduces the first dedicated method for interpreting matching-based FSS models by leveraging their inherent structural properties. Our Affinity Explainer approach extracts attribution maps that highlight which pixels in support images contribute most to query segmentation predictions, using matching scores computed between support and query features at multiple feature levels. We extend standard interpretability evaluation metrics to the FSS domain and propose additional metrics to better capture the practical utility of explanations in few-shot scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on FSS benchmark datasets, using different models, demonstrate that our Affinity Explainer significantly outperforms adapted standard attribution methods. Qualitative analysis reveals that our explanations provide structured, coherent attention patterns that align with model architectures and and enable effective model diagnosis. This work establishes the foundation for interpretable FSS research, enabling better model understanding and diagnostic for more reliable few-shot segmentation systems.

However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness. Extensive experiments show that NUN achieves a leading place on both clean and degraded benchmarks. Code will be released."}

Frequency-domain spherical CNNs partially address this mismatch but require costly spherical harmonic transforms that constrain resolution and efficiency. We introduce the Unified Spherical Frontend (USF), a lens-agnostic framework that transforms images from any calibrated camera into a unit-sphere representation via ray-direction correspondences, and performs spherical resampling, convolution, and pooling directly in the spatial domain. USF is modular: projection, location sampling, interpolation, and resolution control are fully decoupled. Its distance-only spherical kernels offer configurable rotation-equivariance (mirroring translation-equivariance in planar CNNs) while avoiding harmonic transforms entirely. We compare standard planar backbones with their spherical counterparts across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on synthetic (Spherical MNIST) and real-world datasets (PANDORA, Stanford 2D-3D-S), and stress-test robustness to extreme lens distortions, varying FoV, and arbitrary rotations. USF processes high-resolution spherical imagery efficiently and maintains less than 1% performance drop under random test-time rotations, even without rotational augmentation, and even enables zero-shot generalization from one lens type to unseen wide-FoV lenses with minimal performance degradation."}

However, achieving an early diagnosis remains challenging, particularly in distinguishing subtle early signals of malignancy from those of benign conditions. In clinical practice, a patient with a high risk may need to undergo an initial baseline and several annual follow-up examinations (e.g., CT scans) before receiving a definitive diagnosis, which can result in missing the optimal treatment. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been increasingly used for early diagnosis of lung cancer, but most existing algorithms focus on radiomic features extraction from single early-stage CT scans. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models for image generation, this paper proposes a generative method, named CorrFlowNet, which creates a virtual, one-year follow-up CT scan after the initial baseline scan. This virtual follow-up would allow for an early detection of malignant/benign nodules, reducing the need to wait for clinical follow-ups. During training, our approach employs a correlational autoencoder to encode both early baseline and follow-up CT images into a latent space that captures the dynamics of nodule progression as well as the correlations between them, followed by a flow matching algorithm on the latent space with a neural ordinary differential equation. An auxiliary classifier is used to further enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Evaluations on a real clinical dataset show our method can significantly improve downstream lung nodule risk assessment compared with existing baseline models. Moreover, its diagnostic accuracy is comparable with real clinical CT follow-ups, highlighting its potential to improve cancer diagnosis."}

ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95).

Existing benchmarks offer limited customizability over the scene complexity and are incapable of isolating and analyzing specific VLM failure modes under distinct spatial conditions. To address this gap, instead of individually presenting benchmarks for different scene complexities, in this paper we present InfiniBench, a fully automated, customizable and user-friendly benchmark generator that can synthesize a theoretically infinite variety of 3D scenes with parameterized control on scene complexity. InfiniBench uniquely translates scene descriptions in natural language into photo-realistic videos with complex and physically plausible 3D layouts. This is achieved through three key innovations: 1) a LLM-based agentic framework that iteratively refines procedural scene constraints from scene descriptions; 2) a flexible cluster-based layout optimizer that generates dense and cluttered scenes previously intractable for procedural methods; and 3) a task-aware camera trajectory optimization method that renders scenes into videos with full object coverage as VLM input. Experiments demonstrate that InfiniBench outperforms state-of-the-art procedural and LLM-based 3D generation methods in prompt fidelity and physical plausibility, especially in high-complexity scenarios.

The supplemental material includes 23 pages with fourteen figures and four tables", "summary": "The success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) at many clinics relies on the accurate morphological assessment of day 5 blastocysts, a process that is often subjective and inconsistent. While artificial intelligence can help standardize this evaluation, models require large, diverse, and balanced datasets, which are often unavailable due to data scarcity, natural class imbalance, and privacy constraints. Existing generative embryo models can mitigate these issues but face several limitations, such as poor image quality, small training datasets, non-robust evaluation, and lack of clinically relevant image generation for effective data augmentation. Here, we present the Diffusion Based Imaging Model for Artificial Blastocysts (DIA) framework, a set of latent diffusion models trained to generate high-fidelity, novel day 5 blastocyst images. Our models provide granular control by conditioning on Gardner-based morphological categories and z-axis focal depth. We rigorously evaluated the models using FID, a memorization metric, an embryologist Turing test, and three downstream classification tasks. Our results show that DIA models generate realistic images that embryologists could not reliably distinguish from real images. Most importantly, we demonstrated clear clinical value. Augmenting an imbalanced dataset with synthetic images significantly improved classification accuracy (p < 0.05). Also, adding synthetic images to an already large, balanced dataset yielded statistically significant performance gains, and synthetic data could replace up to 40% of real data in some cases without a statistically significant loss in accuracy. DIA provides a robust solution for mitigating data scarcity and class imbalance in embryo datasets. By generating novel, high-fidelity, and controllable synthetic images, our models can improve the performance, fairness, and standardization of AI embryo assessment tools."}

While histopathology represents the gold standard, its invasiveness limits feasibility. Conventional supervised deep learning approaches are constrained by scarce biopsy-confirmed training data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) overcomes this by leveraging the growing availability of large-scale unlabeled brain metastases imaging datasets. Methods: In a two-phase deep learning strategy inspired by the foundation model paradigm, a Vision Transformer (ViT) was pre-trained via SSL on 10,167 unlabeled multi-source T1CE MRI sub-volumes. The pre-trained ViT was then fine-tuned for RN classification using a two-channel input (T1CE MRI and segmentation masks) on the public MOLAB dataset (n=109) using 20% of datasets as same-center held-out test set. External validation was performed on a second-center test cohort (n=28). Results: The self-supervised model achieved an AUC of 0.916 on the same-center test set and 0.764 on the second center test set, surpassing the fully supervised ViT (AUC 0.624/0.496; p=0.001/0.008) and radiomics (AUC 0.807/0.691; p=0.005/0.014). Multimodal integration further improved performance (AUC 0.947/0.821; p=0.073/0.001). Attention map visualizations enabled interpretability showing the model focused on clinically relevant lesion subregions. Conclusion: Large-scale pre-training on increasingly available unlabeled brain metastases datasets substantially improves AI model performance. A two-phase multimodal deep learning strategy achieved high accuracy in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression using only routine T1CE MRI and standard clinical data, providing an interpretable, clinically accessible solution that warrants further validation."}

Its main operation, SConvOp, lowers Linalg convolutions into tiled and packed generic operations through a fully declarative transformation pipeline. The process is guided by a Convolution Slicing Analysis that determines tile sizes and data layout strategies based on input and filter shapes, as well as target architecture parameters. SConvOp handles edge cases by splitting irregular regions and adjusting affine maps where needed. All packing and tiling operations are derived from a parametric set of affine equations, enabling reusable and analyzable transformations. Although functional correctness was the primary goal of this work, the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SConvTransform, achieving good enough performance across different target architectures. Future work will focus on optimizing performance and porting to other target devices. When applied to standard convolution configurations, the generated code achieves up to 60% of peak performance on ARM SME and 67% on Intel AVX512. These results validate the benefit of combining static shape analysis with structured tiling and packing strategies within the MLIR Transform dialect. Furthermore, the modular design of SConvTransform facilitates integration with future extensions, enabling continued optimization of convolution workloads through MLIR's extensible compilation infrastructure."}

However, prior work in LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection demonstrate that naively training on multiple datasets yields worse performance than single dataset models. Interestingly, we find that this conventional wisdom does not hold for motion estimation, and that state-of-the-art scene flow methods greatly benefit from cross-dataset training. We posit that low-level tasks such as motion estimation may be less sensitive to sensor configuration; indeed, our analysis shows that models trained on fast-moving objects (e.g., from highway datasets) perform well on fast-moving objects, even across different datasets. Informed by our analysis, we propose UniFlow, a family of feedforward models that unifies and trains on multiple large-scale LiDAR scene flow datasets with diverse sensor placements and point cloud densities.

We introduce seven masking strategies (V3-V9) targeting different architectural layers (SAM encoder blocks, compression layers, dual vision encoders, projector fusion) and evaluate PHI reduction across HIPAA-defined categories using 100 synthetic medical billing statements (drawn from a corpus of 38,517 annotated documents) with perfect ground-truth annotations. All masking strategies converge to 42.9% PHI reduction, successfully suppressing long-form spatially-distributed identifiers (patient names, dates of birth, physical addresses at 100% effectiveness) while failing to prevent short structured identifiers (medical record numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, account numbers at 0% effectiveness). Ablation studies varying mask expansion radius (r=1,2,3) demonstrate that increased spatial coverage does not improve reduction beyond this ceiling, indicating that language model contextual inference - not insufficient visual masking - drives structured identifier leakage. A simulated hybrid architecture combining vision masking with NLP post-processing achieves 88.6% total PHI reduction (assuming 80% NLP accuracy on remaining identifiers). This negative result establishes boundaries for vision-only privacy interventions in VLMs, provides guidance distinguishing PHI types amenable to vision-level versus language-level redaction, and redirects future research toward decoder-level fine-tuning and hybrid defense-in-depth architectures for HIPAA-compliant medical document processing."}

Existing methods often face a trade-off between edit and motion fidelity, as they rely on motion representations that are either overfitted to the layout or only implicitly defined. To overcome this limitation, we revisit point-based motion representation. However, identifying meaningful points remains challenging without human input, especially across diverse video scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel motion representation, anchor tokens, that capture the most essential motion patterns by leveraging the rich prior of a video diffusion model. Anchor tokens encode video dynamics compactly through a small number of informative point trajectories and can be flexibly relocated to align with new subjects. This allows our method, Point-to-Point, to generalize across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that anchor tokens lead to more controllable and semantically aligned video edits, achieving superior performance in terms of edit and motion fidelity."}

Distilled DMs are faster but typically remain confined within their teacher's domain. Thus, fast and high-quality generation for novel domains relies on two-stage training pipelines: Adapt-then-Distill or Distill-then-Adapt. However, both add design complexity and suffer from degraded quality or diversity. We introduce Uni-DAD, a single-stage pipeline that unifies distillation and adaptation of DMs. It couples two signals during training: (i) a dual-domain distribution-matching distillation objective that guides the student toward the distributions of the source teacher and a target teacher, and (ii) a multi-head generative adversarial network (GAN) loss that encourages target realism across multiple feature scales. The source domain distillation preserves diverse source knowledge, while the multi-head GAN stabilizes training and reduces overfitting, especially in few-shot regimes. The inclusion of a target teacher facilitates adaptation to more structurally distant domains. We perform evaluations on a variety of datasets for few-shot image generation (FSIG) and subject-driven personalization (SDP). Uni-DAD delivers higher quality than state-of-the-art (SoTA) adaptation methods even with less than 4 sampling steps, and outperforms two-stage training pipelines in both quality and diversity."}

To maintain global consistency in large-scale scenes, SwiftVGGT performs loop closure without relying on the external Visual Place Recognition (VPR) model. This removes redundant computation and enables accurate reconstruction over kilometer-scale environments. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective point sampling method to align neighboring chunks using a single Sim(3)-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) step. This eliminates the need for the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimization commonly used in prior work, leading to substantial speed-ups.

As a result, capturing subtle writer-specific traits such as consistent slant, curvature or stroke pressure, while keeping the generated text accurate is still an open problem. In this work, we present a unified framework designed to address these limitations. We introduce a Vision Transformer-based style encoder that learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, allowing the model to better represent long-range structural characteristics of handwriting. We then integrate these style cues with the target text using a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the system to produce handwritten images that more faithfully reflect the intended style. To make the process more interpretable, we utilize Salient Stroke Attention Analysis (SSAA), which reveals the stroke-level features the model focuses on during style transfer. Together, these components lead to handwriting synthesis that is not only more stylistically coherent, but also easier to understand and analyze."}

The aim of this study is to develop an interactive calibration framework that automatically generates the next optimal pose, enabling high-accuracy stereo calibration for 3D deformation measurement. We propose a pose optimization method that introduces joint optimization of relative and absolute extrinsic parameters, with the minimization of the covariance matrix trace adopted as the loss function to solve for the next optimal pose.

In this study, we systematically evaluate three pretrained CNN architectures for brain tumor classification: RadImageNet DenseNet121 with medical-domain pretraining, EfficientNetV2S, and ConvNeXt-Tiny, which are modern general-purpose CNNs. All models were trained and fine-tuned under identical conditions using a limited-size brain MRI dataset to ensure a fair comparison.

The key challenge lies in the structural and transformation diversity inherent in distinct character types, which often leads to mismatched regions and poor transfer quality. To address these issues, we first construct a million-scale pose dataset across hundreds of distinct characters. We further propose MimiCAT, a cascade-transformer model designed for category-free 3D pose transfer. Instead of relying on strict one-to-one correspondence mappings, MimiCAT leverages semantic keypoint labels to learn a novel soft correspondence that enables flexible many-to-many matching across characters. The pose transfer is then formulated as a conditional generation process, in which the source transformations are first projected onto the target through soft correspondence matching and subsequently refined using shape-conditioned representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MimiCAT transfers plausible poses across different characters, significantly outperforming prior methods that are limited to narrow category transfer (e.g., humanoid-to-humanoid)."}

Notably, our model also achieves a 78.5 percent linear probing accuracy on ImageNet, underscoring its strong performance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights for future investigations of Mamba-based vision architectures."}

Traditional methods rely on visual modality, often struggling with complex threats. While recent studies incorporate language to guide single-view images, human inspectors typically use dual-view images in practice. This raises the question: can the second view provide constraints similar to a language modality? In this work, we introduce DualXrayBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for X-ray inspection that includes multiple views and modalities. It supports eight tasks designed to test cross-view reasoning. In DualXrayBench, we introduce a caption corpus consisting of 45,613 dual-view image pairs across 12 categories with corresponding captions. Building upon these data, we propose the Geometric (cross-view)-Semantic (cross-modality) Reasoner (GSR), a multimodal model that jointly learns correspondences between cross-view geometry and cross-modal semantics, treating the second-view images as a \"language-like modality\". To enable this, we construct the GSXray dataset, with structured Chain-of-Thought sequences: <top>, <side>, <conclusion>. Comprehensive evaluations on DualXrayBench demonstrate that GSR achieves significant improvements across all X-ray tasks, offering a new perspective for real-world X-ray inspection."}

Current methods rely on human supervision but become impractical as model complexity increases. When models surpass human knowledge, providing accurate feedback becomes challenging and inefficient. A novel solution proposed recently is using a weaker model to supervise a stronger model. This concept leverages the ability of weaker models to perform evaluations, thereby reducing the workload on human supervisors. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language-only models. Extending this concept to vision-language models leverages these insights, adapting the proven benefits to a multi-modal context. In our study, we explore weak-to-strong generalization for CLIP-based classification. We propose a method, class prototype learning (CPL), which aims to enhance the classification capabilities of the CLIP model, by learning more representative prototypes for each category. Our findings indicate that, despite using a simple loss function under weak supervision, CPL yields robust improvements in targeted scenarios, particularly when pretraining is limited. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective under these settings, achieving a 3.67% improvement over strong baseline methods."}

In this work, we propose 4D-VGGT, a general foundation model with divide-and-conquer spatiotemporal representation for dynamic scene geometry. Our model is divided into three aspects: 1) Multi-setting input.

NeuroVascU-Net builds on a dilated U-Net and integrates two specialized modules: a Multi-Scale Contextual Feature Fusion ($MSC^2F$) module at the bottleneck and a Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion ($CDA^2F$) module at deeper hierarchical layers. $MSC^2F$ captures both local and global information via multi-scale dilated convolutions, while $CDA^2F$ dynamically integrates domain-specific features, enhancing representation while keeping computation low. The model was trained and validated on a curated dataset of T1CE scans from 137 brain tumor biopsy patients, annotated by a board-certified functional neurosurgeon. NeuroVascU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841, accurately segmenting both major and fine vascular structures.

However, current methods that leverage 2D data often result in large, slow-to-train models, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy in resource-constrained environments. The architecture design of such models is therefore critical, determining their performance, memory footprint, and compute efficiency. The Joint-embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has gained wide popularity in self-supervised learning for its simplicity and efficiency, but has been under-explored in cross-modal settings, partly due to the misconception that masking is intrinsic to JEPA. In this light, we propose CrossJEPA, a simple Cross-modal Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that harnesses the knowledge of an image foundation model and trains a predictor to infer embeddings of specific rendered 2D views from corresponding 3D point clouds, thereby introducing a JEPA-style pretraining strategy beyond masking. By conditioning the predictor on cross-domain projection information, CrossJEPA purifies the supervision signal from semantics exclusive to the target domain. We further exploit the frozen teacher design with a one-time target embedding caching mechanism, yielding amortized efficiency. CrossJEPA achieves a new state-of-the-art in linear probing on the synthetic ModelNet40 (94.2%) and the real-world ScanObjectNN (88.3%) benchmarks, using only 14.1M pretraining parameters (8.5M in the point encoder), and about 6 pretraining hours on a standard single GPU. These results position CrossJEPA as a performant, memory-efficient, and fast-to-train framework for 3D representation learning via knowledge distillation. We analyze CrossJEPA intuitively, theoretically, and empirically, and extensively ablate our design choices. Code will be made available."}

Incremental forgery detection aims to gradually update existing models with new forgery data, yet current sample replay-based methods are limited by low diversity and privacy concerns. Generative replay offers a potential solution by synthesizing past data, but its feasibility for forgery detection remains unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate generative replay and identify two scenarios: when the replay generator closely resembles the new forgery model, generated real samples blur the domain boundary, creating domain-risky samples; when the replay generator differs significantly, generated samples can be safely supervised, forming domain-safe samples. To exploit generative replay effectively, we propose a novel Domain-Aware Relative Weighting (DARW) strategy. DARW directly supervises domain-safe samples while applying a Relative Separation Loss to balance supervision and potential confusion for domain-risky samples. A Domain Confusion Score dynamically adjusts this tradeoff according to sample reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARW consistently improves incremental learning performance for forgery detection under different generative replay settings and alleviates the adverse impact of domain overlap."}

This oversight leads to visual hallucinations and reward hacking, as reasoning built upon flawed perception is inherently unreliable. To address this, we propose PEARL (Perceptual-Evidence Anchored Reinforced Learning), a dual-branch, perception-reasoning synergistic that strengthens multimodal reasoning by explicitly anchoring it to verified visual evidence. For each reasoning-oriented QA instance, PEARL first derive a perception checklist -- a set of perception-oriented sub-questions with verifiable answers that probe the model's understanding of key visual evidence. During training, auxiliary rollouts on this checklist yield a perceptual reward that both directly reinforces the model's perception ability and acts as a fidelity gate for reasoning. If the model passes the perception check, its policy update is biased towards evidence-anchored reasoning. Otherwise, the process is halted to prevent reasoning from flawed premises. PEARL can be seamlessly integrated with popular RL methods like GRPO and DAPO. Comprehensive experiments show PEARL achieves substantial gains on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, e.g., a +9.7% improvement over the baseline and +6.6% over GRPO on MathVerse."}

To address these issues, we introduce a new framework that integrates a loop-based paradigm with an anti-hallucination reward. First, to address the insufficient evidence, we introduce the Perception Loop Reasoning (PLR) paradigm. Instead of describing the video at once, each loop requires the model to describe a video segment with precise timestamps, analyze this segment, and decide the next action.

This reward encourages the model to provide sufficient and precise video evidence. Our FAE, which performs comparably to GPT-4o, is tuned on our AnetHallu-117K, a large-scale hallucination judgment preference dataset.

We address the challenge of egocentric 3D visual span forecasting, predicting where a person's visual perception will focus next within their three-dimensional environment. To this end, we propose EgoSpanLift, a novel method that transforms egocentric visual span forecasting from 2D image planes to 3D scenes. EgoSpanLift converts SLAM-derived keypoints into gaze-compatible geometry and extracts volumetric visual span regions. We further combine EgoSpanLift with 3D U-Net and unidirectional transformers, enabling spatio-temporal fusion to efficiently predict future visual span in the 3D grid.

In this work, we propose an adaptive likelihood step-size strategy to guide the diffusion process for inverse-problem formulations. Specifically, we develop an observation-dependent weighting scheme based on the agreement between two different approximations of the intractable intermediate likelihood gradients, that adapts naturally to the diffusion schedule, time re-spacing, and injected stochasticity. The resulting approach, Adaptive Posterior diffusion Sampling (AdaPS), is hyperparameter-free and improves reconstruction quality across diverse imaging tasks - including super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring - on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet-256 validation sets.

Current data-driven methods suffer from hallucination due to the lack of spectral diversity in existing hyperspectral image datasets, particularly when they are evaluated for the metamerism phenomenon. In this work, we formulate hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction as a Bayesian inference problem and propose a framework, HSDiff, that utilizes an unconditionally trained, pixel-level diffusion prior and posterior diffusion sampling to generate diverse HSI samples consistent with the measurements of various hyperspectral image formation models. We propose an enhanced metameric augmentation technique using region-based metameric black and partition-of-union spectral upsampling to expand training with physically valid metameric spectra, strengthening the prior diversity and improving uncertainty calibration. We utilize HSDiff to investigate how the studied forward models shape the posterior distribution and demonstrate that guiding with effective spectral encoding provides calibrated informative uncertainty compared to non-encoded models. Through the lens of the Bayesian framework, HSDiff offers a complete, high-performance method for uncertainty-aware HSI reconstruction. Our results also reiterate the significance of effective spectral encoding in snapshot hyperspectral imaging."}

This paper proposes two adaptive compression techniques -- Sparse Temporal Token Fusion (STTF) and Adaptive Neural Compression (ANC) -- that integrate algorithmic innovations with hardware-aware optimizations. Unlike previous approaches relying on static pruning or uniform scaling, STTF dynamically reuses visual tokens through event-driven change detection, while ANC conditionally activates encoder branches via a learned router, enabling fine-grained adaptation to scene complexity. Our 3B-parameter TinyGPT-STTF achieves CIDEr 131.2, BLEU-4 0.38, METEOR 0.31, and ROUGE-L 0.56 on the COCO 2017 test set, surpassing LLaVA-1.5 7B by 17.6 CIDEr points while using 2.3x fewer parameters and 62x fewer on-device FLOPs. TinyGPT-ANC reaches CIDEr 128.5. On event-based vision tasks, STTF reduces average token count by 84% (from 196 to 31 tokens) while preserving 95.6% accuracy on the DVS128 Gesture dataset, and ANC cuts FLOPs by up to 90% in low-motion scenes. Compared to strong baselines, our models improve accuracy by up to 4.4% and reduce latency by up to 13x.

Existing DUNs are derived from full-HSI imaging models, where each stage operates directly on the high-dimensional HSI, refining the entire data cube based on the single 2D coded measurement. However, this paradigm leads to computational redundancy and suffers from the ill-posed nature of mapping 2D residuals back to 3D space of HSI. In this paper, we propose two novel imaging models corresponding to the spectral basis and subspace image by explicitly integrating low-rank (LR) decomposition with the sensing model. Compared to recovering the full HSI, estimating these compact low-dimensional components significantly mitigates the ill-posedness. Building upon these novel models, we develop the Low-Rank Deep Unfolding Network (LRDUN), which jointly solves the two subproblems within an unfolded proximal gradient descent (PGD) framework. Furthermore, we introduce a Generalized Feature Unfolding Mechanism (GFUM) that decouples the physical rank in the data-fidelity term from the feature dimensionality in the prior module, enhancing the representational capacity and flexibility of the network.

These two applications are centralized as a single-platform and can be utilized for routine-maintenance and any other checks. These are checked against various parameters such as power output, sinusoidal wave (I-V component of solar cell), voltage across each solar cell and others. Firstly, we filter and preprocess the obtained images using gamma removal and Gaussian filtering methods alongside some predefined processes like normalization. The first application is to detect whether a solar cell is dusty or not based on various pre-determined metrics like shadowing, leaf, droppings, air pollution and from other human activities to extent of fine-granular solar modules. The other one is detecting faults and other such occurrences on solar panels like faults, cracks, cell malfunction using thermal imaging application. This centralized platform can be vital since solar panels have different efficiency across different geography (air and heat affect) and can also be utilized for small-scale house requirements to large-scale solar farm sustentation effectively. It incorporates CNN, ResNet models that with self-attention mechanisms-KerNet model which are used for classification and results in a fine-tuned system that detects dust or any fault occurring.

In contrast, little attention has been paid to the training cost explosion that inevitably arises as the number of novel classes increases, a consequence of relying on gradient learning even under extreme data scarcity. More critically, since FSCIL typically provides only a few samples for each new class, gradient-based updates not only induce severe catastrophic forgetting on base classes but also hinder adaptation to novel ones. This paper seeks to break this long-standing limitation by asking: Can we design a training-free FSCIL paradigm that entirely removes gradient optimization? We provide an affirmative answer by uncovering an intriguing connection between gradient-based optimization and the Conditional Diffusion process. Building on this observation, we propose a Conditional Diffusion-driven FSCIL (CD-FSCIL) framework that substitutes the conventional gradient update process with a diffusion-based generative transition, enabling training-free incremental adaptation while effectively mitigating forgetting. Furthermore, to enhance representation under few-shot constraints, we introduce a multimodal learning strategy that integrates visual features with natural language descriptions automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). This synergy substantially alleviates the sample scarcity issue and improves generalization across novel classes. Extensive experiments on mainstream FSCIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also drastically reduces computational and memory overhead, marking a paradigm shift toward training-free continual adaptation."}

In this paper, we introduce the first zero-shot video deraining method for complex dynamic scenes that does not require synthetic data nor model fine-tuning, by leveraging a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. By inverting an input video into the latent space of diffusion models, its reconstruction process can be intervened and pushed away from the model's concept of rain using negative prompting. At the core of our approach is an attention switching mechanism that we found is crucial for maintaining dynamic backgrounds as well as structural consistency between the input and the derained video, mitigating artifacts introduced by naive negative prompting. Our approach is validated through extensive experiments on real-world rain datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods and showcasing robust generalization without the need for supervised training."}

This paper addresses a challenging version of this problem: predicting correspondences between ground-level photos and floor plans. Current datasets for joint photo--floor plan reasoning are limited, either lacking in varying modalities (VIGOR) or lacking in correspondences (WAFFLE). To address these limitations, we introduce a new dataset, C3, created by first reconstructing a number of scenes in 3D from Internet photo collections via structure-from-motion, then manually registering the reconstructions to floor plans gathered from the Internet, from which we can derive correspondence between images and floor plans. C3 contains 90K paired floor plans and photos across 597 scenes with 153M pixel-level correspondences and 85K camera poses. We find that state-of-the-art correspondence models struggle on this task.

Specifically, to supply informative conditioning cues for VAR models, we deploy an adaptive curve estimation scheme to modulate the diverse illumination based on VLM-derived visibility scores. In addition, we integrate dynamic and spatial-frequency-aware Rotary Positional Encodings (SF-RoPE) into VAR to enhance its ability to model structures degraded by blur.

In this paper, we explore this possibility with NeAR: a Coupled Neural Asset-Renderer Stack. On the asset side, we build on Trellis-style Structured 3D Latents and introduce a lighting-homogenized neural asset: from a casually lit input, a rectified-flow backbone predicts a Lighting-Homogenized SLAT that encodes geometry and intrinsic material cues in a compact, view-agnostic latent. On the renderer side, we design a lighting-aware neural renderer that uses this neural asset, along with explicit view embeddings and HDR environment maps, to achieve real-time, relightable rendering. We validate NeAR on four tasks: (1) G-buffer-based forward rendering, (2) random-lit single-image reconstruction, (3) unknown-lit single-image relighting, and (4) novel-view relighting. Our coupled stack surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality.

For training, we curated a dataset of facial meshes, with a subset meticulously rigged by professional artists to serve as accurate 3D ground truth for deformation supervision. Due to the high cost of manual rigging, this subset is limited in size, constraining the generalization ability of models trained exclusively on it. To address this, we design a 2D supervision strategy for unlabeled neutral meshes without rigs.

Training such patches typically requires regularization that improves physical realizability (e.g., printability, smoothness) and/or robustness to real-world variability (e.g. deformations, viewing angle, noise). One type of variability that has received little attention is scale variability. When a patch is rescaled, either digitally through downsampling/upsampling or physically through changing imaging distances, interpolation-induced color mixing occurs. This smooths out pixel values, resulting in a loss of high-frequency patterns and degrading the adversarial signal. To address this, we present a novel superpixel-based regularization method that guides patch optimization to scale-resilient structures. Our ap proach employs the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm to dynamically cluster pixels in an adversarial patch during optimization. The Implicit Function Theorem is used to backpropagate gradients through SLIC to update the superpixel boundaries and color. This produces patches that maintain their structure over scale and are less susceptible to interpolation losses. Our method achieves greater performance in the digital domain, and when realized physically, these performance gains are preserved, leading to improved physical performance. Real-world performance was objectively assessed using a novel physical evaluation protocol that utilizes screens and cardboard cut-outs to systematically vary real-world conditions."}

Diffusion-based NVS can generate high-quality, temporally consistent images, however, remains computationally prohibitive. Conversely, regression-based NVS offers suboptimal generation quality despite requiring significantly lower compute; leaving the design objective of a high-quality, inference-efficient NVS framework an open challenge. To close this critical gap, we present Sphinx, a training-free hybrid inference framework that achieves diffusion-level fidelity at a significantly lower compute. Sphinx proposes to use regression-based fast initialization to guide and reduce the denoising workload for the diffusion model. Additionally, it integrates selective refinement with adaptive noise scheduling, allowing more compute to uncertain regions and frames. This enables Sphinx to provide flexible navigation of the performance-quality trade-off, allowing adaptation to latency and fidelity requirements for dynamically changing inference scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Sphinx achieves an average 1.8x speedup over diffusion model inference with negligible perceptual degradation of less than 5%, establishing a new Pareto frontier between quality and latency in NVS serving."}

Existing methods often rely on neural overfitting, where a coarse mesh is stored and progressively refined through multiple decoder networks. While this can restore high-quality surfaces, it is computationally expensive due to successive decoding passes and the irregular structure of mesh data. In contrast, images have a regular structure that enables powerful super-resolution and restoration frameworks, but applying these advantages to meshes is difficult because their irregular connectivity demands complex encoder-decoder architectures. Our key insight is that a geometry image-based representation transforms irregular meshes into a regular image grid, making efficient image-based neural processing directly applicable. Building on this idea, we introduce our neural geometry image-based representation, which is decoder-free, storage-efficient, and naturally suited for neural processing. It stores a low-resolution geometry-image mipmap of the surface, from which high-quality meshes are restored in a single forward pass. To construct geometry images, we leverage Optimal Transport (OT), which resolves oversampling in flat regions and undersampling in feature-rich regions, and enables continuous levels of detail (LoD) through geometry-image mipmapping. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art storage efficiency and restoration accuracy, measured by compression ratio (CR), Chamfer distance (CD), and Hausdorff distance (HD)."}

Structured-light scanning with phase-shifting techniques is preferred for its use of low-intensity visible light and high accuracy, making it well suited for capturing 4D facial dynamics. A key step is phase unwrapping, which recovers continuous phase values from measurements wrapped modulo 2pi. The goal is to estimate the unwrapped phase count k in the equation Phi = phi + 2pi k, where phi is the wrapped phase and Phi is the true phase. Noise, occlusions, and complex 3D geometry make recovering the true phase challenging because phase unwrapping is ill-posed: measurements only provide modulo 2pi values, and estimating k requires assumptions about surface continuity. Existing methods trade speed for accuracy: fast approaches lack precision, while accurate algorithms are too slow for real-time use. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a phase unwrapping framework that reformulates GraphCut-based unwrapping as a pixel-labeling problem. This framework improves the estimation of the unwrapped phase count k through the invariance property of diffeomorphisms applied in image space via conformal and optimal transport (OT) maps. An odd number of diffeomorphisms are precomputed from the input phase data, and a hierarchical GraphCut algorithm is applied in each domain. The resulting label maps are fused via majority voting to robustly estimate k at each pixel. Experimental results demonstrate a 45.5x speedup and lower L2 error in real experiments and simulations, showing potential for real-time applications."}

We introduce Instant Concept Erasure (ICE), a training-free, modality-agnostic, one-shot weight modification approach that achieves precise, persistent unlearning with zero overhead. ICE defines erase and preserve subspaces using anisotropic energy-weighted scaling, then explicitly regularises against their intersection using a unique, closed-form overlap projector. We pose a convex and Lipschitz-bounded Spectral Unlearning Objective, balancing erasure fidelity and intersection preservation, that admits a stable and unique analytical solution.

Existing works primarily focus on methods such as adjusting networks or training strategies to address noisy image recognition, and the anti-noise performance has reached a bottleneck.

This convolution mimics the dendritic structure of neurons, integrates the neighborhood interaction computation logic of dendrites into the underlying design of convolutional operations, and simulates the XOR logic preprocessing function of biological dendrites through nonlinear interactions between input features, thereby fundamentally reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction. Unlike traditional convolution where noise directly interferes with feature extraction and exerts a significant impact, DDC mitigates the influence of noise by focusing on the interaction of neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate that in image classification tasks (using YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, and EfficientNet-B0) and object detection tasks (using YOLOv11, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5), after replacing traditional convolution with the dendritic convolution, the accuracy of the EfficientNet-B0 model on noisy datasets is relatively improved by 11.23%, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv8 is increased by 19.80%. The consistency between the computation method of this convolution and the dendrites of biological neurons enables it to perform significantly better than traditional convolution in complex noisy environments."}

The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed \"consistent\" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected.

The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features. To ensure efficient decomposition, we apply orthogonal decorrelation constraints separately to decomposers and subrouters, enhancing their diversity. Furthermore, we propose a cross-domain activation consistency loss to guarantee that target and source samples of the same category exhibit consistent activation preferences of the decomposers, thereby facilitating domain alignment.

However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility.

To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes.

To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation."}

To quantify these effects, we introduce Perfection Gap Factor (PGF), a metric that captures both the breadth and magnitude of transfer. Using three open-weight VLMs evaluated across 13 perception tasks, we construct a task-transfer graph that reveals previously unobserved relationships among perception tasks. Our analysis uncovers patterns of positive and negative transfer, identifies groups of tasks that mutually influence each other, organizes tasks into personas based on their transfer behavior and demonstrates how PGF can guide data selection for more efficient training.

We shift from this limited paradigm and apply a foundation model approach, leveraging Masked Autoencoding (MAE) style pretraining on the largest and most heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI datasets collection assembled to date. Our study pretrains and evaluates models on over 1.3 million samples extracted from 14 datasets, collected using 4 distinct devices across the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and bandwidths from 20 to 160 MHz. Our large-scale evaluation is the first to systematically disentangle the impacts of data diversity versus model capacity on cross-domain performance. The results establish scaling trends on Wi-Fi CSI sensing. First, our experiments show log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, suggesting that data scale and diversity are key to domain generalization. Second, based on the current data volume, larger model can only provide marginal gains for cross-domain performance, indicating that data, rather than model capacity, is the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization. Finally, we conduct a series of cross-domain evaluations on human activity recognition, human gesture recognition and user identification tasks. The results show that the large-scale pretraining improves cross-domain accuracy ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%, compared to the supervised learning baseline.

However, these methods inherit a set of limitations, including vulnerability to overconfidence. In this work, we introduce SupLID, a novel framework that effectively guides classifier-derived OOD scores by exploiting the geometrical structure of the underlying semantic space, particularly using Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). While LID effectively characterizes the local structure of high-dimensional data by analyzing distance distributions, its direct application at the pixel level remains challenging. To overcome this, SupLID constructs a geometrical coreset that captures the intrinsic structure of the in-distribution (ID) subspace. It then computes OOD scores at the superpixel level, enabling both efficient real-time inference and improved spatial smoothness. We demonstrate that geometrical cues derived from SupLID serve as a complementary signal to traditional classifier confidence, enhancing the model's ability to detect diverse OOD scenarios. Designed as a post-hoc scoring method, SupLID can be seamlessly integrated with any semantic segmentation classifier at deployment time.

We therefore present a fully automated pipeline that converts raw 3D scans into unambiguous, high-quality dialogue data at a fraction of the previous cost. By synergizing rule-based constraints with 2D MLLMs and LLMs, the pipeline enables controllable, scalable generation without human intervention. The pipeline comprises four stages: (1) meta-annotation collection harvesting object-, frame-, and scene-level captions, (2) scene graph construction with relation correction to capture proximal object relations, (3) discriminative object referring that generates exclusive and compact descriptions, and (4) multi-task data generation synthesizing diverse dialogues. Our pipeline systematically mitigates inherent flaws in source datasets and produces the final Disc3D dataset, over 2 million samples in 25K hybrid 3D scenes, spanning scene, view, and object captioning, visual grounding, and five object-centric QA tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with Disc3D yields consistent, significant improvements on both public benchmarks and our multifaceted Disc3D-QA tasks.

To resolve this dilemma, we propose DiP, an efficient pixel space diffusion framework. DiP decouples generation into a global and a local stage: a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone operates on large patches for efficient global structure construction, while a co-trained lightweight Patch Detailer Head leverages contextual features to restore fine-grained local details. This synergistic design achieves computational efficiency comparable to LDMs without relying on a VAE.

During supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we construct \"key-information-missing\" videos by extracting event-action keywords from captions, identifying corresponding key frames, and replacing them with adjacent frames. We jointly encode original and modified video tokens with text tokens, aligning intermediate visual representations with keywords via an auxiliary contrastive loss to enhance sensitivity to fine-grained motion cues.

Most models of this process posit that children learn early object labels from co-occurrences of words and their referents that occur when someone around them talks about an object in the immediate physical environment. But how aligned in time are children's visual and linguistic experiences during everyday learning? To date, answers to this question have been limited by the need for labor-intensive manual annotations of vision-language co-occurrences. Here, we evaluate the use of contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) models to automatically characterize vision-language alignment in egocentric videos taken from the infant perspective in home environments. After validating CLIP alignment scores using human alignment judgments, we apply this metric to a large corpus of infant-perspective videos. We show that idealized aligned moments for learning (e.g., \"look at the ball\" with a ball present in the child's view) are relatively rare in children's everyday experiences compared to modern machine learning datasets, and highlight variability in alignment both within and across children. These findings suggest that infrequent alignment is a constraint for models describing early word learning and offer a new method for investigating children's multimodal environment."}

These multi-aspect annotations enable both accurate quality assessment and interpretable reasoning behind the scores. To leverage this data, we propose a unified evaluation model that jointly performs quality scoring and attribution-based explanation. The model adopts the SlowFast framework to distinguish between fast frames and slow frames - slow frames are processed with high resolution while fast frames use low resolution, balancing evaluation accuracy and computational efficiency. For training, we use data formatted in Chain-of-Thought (COT) style and employ a multi-stage strategy: we first conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), then further enhance the model with Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and finally perform SFT again to improve model stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality prediction while also providing human-aligned, interpretable justifications.

These conventional methods often require significant time and may vary depending on the evaluator. However, the emergence of advanced artificial intelligence techniques has created new opportunities for detecting anxiety in a more consistent and automated manner. To address the limitations of traditional approaches, this study introduces a comprehensive model that integrates deep learning architectures with optimization strategies inspired by swarm intelligence. Using multimodal and wearable-sensor datasets, the framework analyzes physiological, emotional, and behavioral signals. Swarm intelligence techniques including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization are incorporated to refine the feature space and optimize hyperparameters. Meanwhile, deep learning components are tasked with deriving layered and discriminative representations from sequential, multi-source inputs. Our evaluation shows that the fusion of these two computational paradigms significantly enhances detection performance compared with using deep networks alone. The hybrid model achieves notable improvements in accuracy and demonstrates stronger generalization across various individuals. Overall, the results highlight the potential of combining metaheuristic optimization with deep learning to develop scalable, objective, and clinically meaningful solutions for assessing anxiety disorders"}

While data synthesis has improved data efficiency in the image domain, its extension to video remains challenging due to pervasive temporal redundancy and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we uncover a critical insight: the primary source of inefficiency in video datasets is not inter-sample redundancy, but intra-sample frame-level redundancy. To leverage this insight, we introduce VideoCompressa, a novel framework for video data synthesis that reframes the problem as dynamic latent compression. Specifically, VideoCompressa jointly optimizes a differentiable keyframe selector-implemented as a lightweight ConvNet with Gumbel-Softmax sampling-to identify the most informative frames, and a pretrained, frozen Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress these frames into compact, semantically rich latent codes. These latent representations are then fed into a compression network, enabling end-to-end backpropagation. Crucially, the keyframe selector and synthetic latent codes are co-optimized to maximize retention of task-relevant information. Experiments show that our method achieves unprecedented data efficiency: on UCF101 with ConvNets, VideoCompressa surpasses full-data training by 2.34\\% points using only 0.13\\% of the original data, with over 5800x speedup compared to traditional synthesis method.

In this work, we investigate this issue within the ReFlow framework and propose FlowSteer, a method unlocks the potential of ReFlow-based distillation by guiding the student along teacher's authentic generation trajectories. We first identify that Piecewised ReFlow's performance is hampered by a critical distribution mismatch during the training and propose Online Trajectory Alignment(OTA) to resolve it. Then, we introduce a adversarial distillation objective applied directly on the ODE trajectory, improving the student's adherence to the teacher's generation trajectory.

Our approach introduces three key innovations: \\textbf{1) Next-Focus Prediction Paradigm} that transforms multi-scale autoregression by progressively reducing blur rather than simply downsampling; \\textbf{2) Progressive Refocusing Pyramid Construction} that uses physics-consistent defocus kernels to build clean, alias-free multi-scale representations; and \\textbf{3) High-Frequency Residual Learning} that employs a specialized residual teacher network to effectively incorporate alias information during training while maintaining deployment simplicity. Specifically, we construct optical low-pass views using defocus point spread function (PSF) kernels with decreasing radius, creating smooth blur-to-clarity transitions that eliminate aliasing at its source. To further enhance detail generation, we introduce a High-Frequency Residual Teacher that learns from both clean structure and alias residuals, distilling this knowledge to a vanilla VAR deployment network for seamless inference.

Initial architectural development failed to stabilize performance and calibration using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), yielding an unacceptable Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.7588. This technical failure necessitated a rigorous architectural pivot to a high diversity, 9-member Deep Ensemble (DE).

Its advantages have led to widespread adoption in domains such as medical image segmentation. However, the existing approaches mostly overlook the potential benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, where each client contains segmentation data of different organs. In this work, we introduce a novel personalized federated approach for organ agnostic tumor segmentation (FedOAP), that utilizes cross-attention to model long-range dependencies among the shared features of different clients and a boundary-aware loss to improve segmentation consistency. FedOAP employs a decoupled cross-attention (DCA), which enables each client to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs aggregated from all clients, thereby capturing long-range inter-organ feature dependencies. Additionally, we introduce perturbed boundary loss (PBL) which focuses on the inconsistencies of the predicted mask's boundary for each client, forcing the model to localize the margins more precisely. We evaluate FedOAP on diverse tumor segmentation tasks spanning different organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated and personalized segmentation methods."}

To mitigate this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel solution that highlights the use of motion discretization. Specifically, we employ unsupervised clustering in the latent motion representation space to derive a set of anchor motions, whose regularity aids in supervising the human pose estimator and enables efficient self-replay. Additionally, we introduce an effective and efficient soft-reset mechanism by reverting the pose estimator to its exponential moving average during continuous adaptation. We examine long-term online adaptation by continuously adapting to out-of-domain streaming test videos of the same individual, which allows for the capture of consistent personal shape and motion traits throughout the streaming observation. By mitigating error accumulation, our solution enables robust exploitation of these personal traits for enhanced accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms previous online test-time adaptation methods and validate our design choices."}

In this paper, we rethink long-tailed dataset distillation by revisiting the limitations of trajectory-based methods, and instead adopt the statistical alignment perspective to jointly mitigate model bias and restore fair supervision. To this end, we introduce three dedicated components that enable unbiased recovery of distilled images and soft relabeling: (1) enhancing expert models (an observer model for recovery and a teacher model for relabeling) to enable reliable statistics estimation and soft-label generation; (2) recalibrating BN statistics via a full forward pass with dynamically adjusted momentum to reduce representation skew; (3) initializing synthetic images by incrementally selecting high-confidence and diverse augmentations via a multi-round mechanism that promotes coverage and diversity.

However, this complexity paradoxically introduces feature redundancy and cross-component interference that obscure salient cues, ultimately reaching performance bottlenecks. In contrast, human vision achieves efficient salient object identification without such architectural complexity. This contrast raises a fundamental question: can we design a biologically grounded yet architecturally simple SOD framework that dispenses with most of this engineering complexity, while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability? In this work, we answer this question affirmatively by introducing DualGazeNet, a biologically inspired pure Transformer framework that models the dual biological principles of robust representation learning and magnocellular-parvocellular dual-pathway processing with cortical attention modulation in the human visual system. Extensive experiments on five RGB SOD benchmarks show that DualGazeNet consistently surpasses 25 state-of-the-art CNN- and Transformer-based methods. On average, DualGazeNet achieves about 60\\% higher inference speed and 53.4\\% fewer FLOPs than four Transformer-based baselines of similar capacity (VST++, MDSAM, Sam2unet, and BiRefNet).

Despite its success, the representational capacity of 3DGS remains limited by the use of 3D Gaussian kernels to model local variations. Recent works have proposed to augment 3DGS with additional per-primitive capacity, such as per-splat textures, to enhance its expressiveness. However, these per-splat texture approaches primarily target dense novel view synthesis with a reduced number of Gaussian primitives, and their effectiveness tends to diminish when applied to more general reconstruction scenarios. In this paper, we aim to achieve concrete performance improvement over state-of-the-art 3DGS variants across a wide range of reconstruction tasks, including novel view synthesis, geometry and dynamic reconstruction, under both sparse and dense input settings. To this end, we introduce Neural Texture Splatting (NTS). At the core of our approach is a global neural field (represented as a hybrid of a tri-plane and a neural decoder) that predicts local appearance and geometric fields for each primitive. By leveraging this shared global representation that models local texture fields across primitives, we significantly reduce model size and facilitate efficient global information exchange, demonstrating strong generalization across tasks. Furthermore, our neural modeling of local texture fields introduces expressive view- and time-dependent effects, a critical aspect that existing methods fail to account for.

Naively pruning less-informative visual tokens reduces this burden, yet indiscriminate removal can strip away contextual cues essential for background or fine-grained questions, undermining accuracy. In this paper, we present ParVTS (Parallel Vision Token Scheduling), a training-free scheduling framework that partitions visual tokens into subject and non-subject groups, processes them in parallel to transfer their semantics into question tokens, and discards the non-subject path mid-inference to reduce computation. This scheduling reduces computational complexity, requires no heuristics or additional modules, and is compatible with diverse existing MLLM architectures. Experiments across multiple MLLM backbones show that ParVTS prunes up to 88.9% of visual tokens with minimal performance drop, achieving 1.77x speedup and 70% FLOPs reduction."}

Although machine learning-based approaches to support photovoltaic (PV) planning on rooftops are well researched, automated approaches for facades still remain scarce and oversimplified. This paper therefore presents a pipeline that integrates detailed information on the architectural composition of the facade to automatically identify suitable surfaces for PV application and estimate the solar energy potential. The pipeline fine-tunes SegFormer-B5 on the CMP Facades dataset and converts semantic predictions into facade-level PV suitability masks and PV panel layouts considering module sizes and clearances. Applied to a dataset of 373 facades with known dimensions from ten cities, the results show that installable BIPV potential is significantly lower than theoretical potential, thus providing valuable insights for reliable urban energy planning. With the growing availability of facade imagery, the proposed pipeline can be scaled to support BIPV planning in cities worldwide."}

Although they achieve impressive results, two key limitations remain. First, they fail to fully exploit the correspondence between instruction-driven scene motion and the underlying 3D geometry, which results in structural instability under viewpoint changes. Second, they easily forget historical information during multi-step interaction, resulting in error accumulation and progressive drift in scene semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose MagicWorld, an interactive video world model that integrates 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval. MagicWorld starts from a single scene image, employs user actions to drive dynamic scene evolution, and autoregressively synthesizes continuous scenes. We introduce the Action-Guided 3D Geometry Module (AG3D), which constructs a point cloud from the first frame of each interaction and the corresponding action, providing explicit geometric constraints for viewpoint transitions and thereby improving structural consistency. We further propose History Cache Retrieval (HCR) mechanism, which retrieves relevant historical frames during generation and injects them as conditioning signals, helping the model utilize past scene information and mitigate error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that MagicWorld achieves notable improvements in scene stability and continuity across interaction iterations."}

This paper has been accepted for publication in AAAI-2026", "summary": "Remote sensing images are becoming increasingly widespread in military, earth resource exploration. Because of the limitation of a single sensor, we can obtain high spatial resolution grayscale panchromatic (PAN) images and low spatial resolution color multispectral (MS) images. Therefore, an important issue is to obtain a color image with high spatial resolution when there is only a PAN image at the input. The existing methods improve spatial resolution using super-resolution (SR) technology and spectral recovery using colorization technology. However, the SR technique cannot improve the spectral resolution, and the colorization technique cannot improve the spatial resolution. Moreover, the pansharpening method needs two registered inputs and can not achieve SR. As a result, an integrated approach is expected. To solve the above problems, we designed a novel multi-function model (MFmamba) to realize the tasks of SR, spectral recovery, joint SR and spectral recovery through three different inputs. Firstly, MFmamba utilizes UNet++ as the backbone, and a Mamba Upsample Block (MUB) is combined with UNet++. Secondly, a Dual Pool Attention (DPA) is designed to replace the skip connection in UNet++. Finally, a Multi-scale Hybrid Cross Block (MHCB) is proposed for initial feature extraction. Many experiments show that MFmamba is competitive in evaluation metrics and visual results and performs well in the three tasks when only the input PAN image is used."}

To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants."}

While such threats have been extensively studied in unimodal settings, their impact on multimodal foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{BackdoorVLM}, the first comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating backdoor attacks on VLMs across a broad range of settings. It adopts a unified perspective that injects and analyzes backdoors across core vision-language tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering. BackdoorVLM organizes multimodal backdoor threats into 5 representative categories: targeted refusal, malicious injection, jailbreak, concept substitution, and perceptual hijack. Each category captures a distinct pathway through which an adversary can manipulate a model's behavior. We evaluate these threats using 12 representative attack methods spanning text, image, and bimodal triggers, tested on 2 open-source VLMs and 3 multimodal datasets. Our analysis reveals that VLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to textual instructions, and in bimodal backdoors the text trigger typically overwhelms the image trigger when forming the backdoor mapping. Notably, backdoors involving the textual modality remain highly potent, with poisoning rates as low as 1\\% yielding over 90\\% success across most tasks. These findings highlight significant, previously underexplored vulnerabilities in current VLMs. We hope that BackdoorVLM can serve as a useful benchmark for analyzing and mitigating multimodal backdoor threats.

Our framework adapts a powerful video generation model for joint RGB and pointmap generation, with carefully designed network architectures.

First, the reliance on a single garment image as input in current virtual try-on datasets limits the accurate capture of realistic texture details. Second, most existing methods focus solely on generating full-shot virtual try-on videos, neglecting the business's demand for videos that also provide detailed close-ups. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-resolution dataset for video-based virtual try-on. This dataset offers two key features. First, it provides more detailed information on the garments, which includes high-fidelity images with detailed close-ups and textual descriptions; Second, it uniquely includes full-shot and close-up try-on videos of real human models. Furthermore, accurately assessing consistency becomes significantly more critical for the close-up videos, which demand high-fidelity preservation of garment details. To facilitate such fine-grained evaluation, we propose a new garment consistency metric VGID (Video Garment Inception Distance) that quantifies the preservation of both texture and structure. Our experiments validate these contributions. We demonstrate that by utilizing the detailed images from our dataset, existing video generation models can extract and incorporate texture features, significantly enhancing the realism and detail fidelity of virtual try-on results.

Although existing methods have progressed from single-modal to multimodal approaches, they face critical limitations: single-modal methods struggle with feature degradation under data compression in social media streaming, while multimodal approaches require expensive data collection and labeling and suffer from inconsistent modal quality or accessibility in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework for robust cross-compression-rate (CCR) deepfake detection. In the training stage, our approach transforms a single visual modality into three complementary features: compression-robust rPPG signals, temporal landmark dynamics, and semantic embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models. These features are explicitly aligned through an affinity-driven semantic alignment (ASA) strategy, which models inter-modal relationships through affinity matrices and optimizes their consistency through contrastive learning. Subsequently, our cross-quality similarity learning (CQSL) strategy enhances feature robustness across compression rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across various compression rates and manipulation types, establishing a new benchmark for robust deepfake detection.

Although models trained on this dataset achieve high accuracy, they often fail to generalize to real-world field images, such as those submitted by farmers to plant diagnostic systems. This has created a significant gap between published studies and practical application requirements, highlighting the necessity of investigating and addressing this issue. In this study, we investigate whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning approaches can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world agricultural conditions in plant disease classification. We evaluate three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based zero-shot models. While CNNs exhibit limited robustness under domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrate stronger generalization by capturing global contextual features.

Motivated by recent findings on representation alignment for diffusion models, we hypothesize that improving the multi-view consistency of video diffusion representations will yield more 3D-consistent video generation. Through detailed analysis on multiple recent camera-controlled video diffusion models we reveal strong correlations between 3D-consistent representations and videos.

In this paper, we propose a Text-to-LiDAR Diffusion Model for scene generation, named T2LDM, with a Self-Conditioned Representation Guidance (SCRG). Specifically, SCRG, by aligning to the real representations, provides the soft supervision with reconstruction details for the Denoising Network (DN) in training, while decoupled in inference. In this way, T2LDM can perceive rich geometric structures from data distribution, generating detailed objects in scenes. Meanwhile, we construct a content-composable Text-LiDAR benchmark, T2nuScenes, along with a controllability metric. Based on this, we analyze the effects of different text prompts for LiDAR generation quality and controllability, providing practical prompt paradigms and insights. Furthermore, a directional position prior is designed to mitigate street distortion, further improving scene fidelity. Additionally, by learning a conditional encoder via frozen DN, T2LDM can support multiple conditional tasks, including Sparse-to-Dense, Dense-to-Sparse, and Semantic-to-LiDAR generation. Extensive experiments in unconditional and conditional generation demonstrate that T2LDM outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation."}

To bridge these gaps, we introduce Bench-C, a comprehensive benchmark emphasizing discriminative samples for assessing corruption robustness, where a selection strategy is proposed to jointly consider the prediction inconsistency under corruption and the semantic diversity. Furthermore, we propose the Robustness Alignment Score (RAS), a unified metric that measures degradation in logit-level prediction structure by considering the shifts in prediction uncertainty and calibration alignment. Comprehensive experiments and analysis reveal several interesting findings: 1) model behaviors exhibit distinguish patterns under corruptions, such as erroneous confidence and hesitation; 2) despite subtle corruption may lead to a slight accuracy gain, the overall prediction structure still degrades; 3) by decomposing corruption robustness into destructive and corrective components, the distinct failure and recovery patterns across models can be revealed."}

To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet).

We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. Unlike conventional semantic change detection (SCD), our approach eliminates the need for large-scale semantic annotations of bi-temporal images, instead focusing directly on the changed regions. We term this new task change semantic detection (CSD). The CSD task represents a direct extension of binary change detection (BCD). Due to the limited spatial extent of semantic regions, it presents greater challenges than traditional SCD tasks. We evaluated our method under the CSD framework on both the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively addresses the CSD task, and its outstanding performance paves the way for practical applications in rapid damage assessment across conflict zones."}

This gap leads to suboptimal performance in tasks involving video generation. To address this, we conduct a formal analysis of DPO loss through updating policy within the diffusion framework, which describes how the updating of specific training samples influences the model's predictions on other samples. Using this tool, we identify two main failure modes: (1) Optimization Conflict, which arises from small reward margins between chosen and rejected samples, and (2) Suboptimal Maximization, caused by large reward margins. Informed by these insights, we introduce a novel solution named Policy-Guided DPO (PG-DPO), combining Adaptive Rejection Scaling (ARS) and Implicit Preference Regularization (IPR) to effectively mitigate likelihood displacement.

To address these challenges, we introduce Granular Computing-driven SAM (Grc-SAM), a coarse-to-fine framework motivated by Granular Computing (GrC). First, the coarse stage adaptively extracts high-response regions from features to achieve precise foreground localization and reduce reliance on external prompts.

Although CLIP-based detectors exhibit promising generalization, they often rely on semantic cues rather than generator artifacts, leading to brittle performance under distribution shifts. In this work, we revisit the nature of semantic bias and uncover that Patch Shuffle provides an unusually strong benefit for CLIP, that disrupts global semantic continuity while preserving local artifact cues, which reduces semantic entropy and homogenizes feature distributions between natural and synthetic images. Through a detailed layer-wise analysis, we further show that CLIP's deep semantic structure functions as a regulator that stabilizes cross-domain representations once semantic bias is suppressed. Guided by these findings, we propose SemAnti, a semantic-antagonistic fine-tuning paradigm that freezes the semantic subspace and adapts only artifact-sensitive layers under shuffled semantics. Despite its simplicity, SemAnti achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization on AIGCDetectBenchmark and GenImage, demonstrating that regulating semantics is key to unlocking CLIP's full potential for robust AI-generated image detection."}

Its core contributions are a Dual-Gated Complementary Mamba fusion module (DGC-MFM) that adaptively balances RGB and IR modalities through illumination-aware and difference-aware gating mechanisms, and a Hierarchical Feature Aggregation Neck (HFAN) that uses a ``refine-then-fuse'' strategy to enhance multi-scale features. Our comprehensive experiments validate this dual-pronged approach. On the dual-modality DroneVehicle dataset, the full model achieves a state-of-the-art mAP of 83.2%, an improvement of 7.9% over the baseline. On the single-modality VisDrone dataset, a variant using only the HFAN also shows significant gains, demonstrating its general applicability.

Our ABM-LoRA addresses this by aligning the adapter's activation boundaries with those of the pretrained model before downstream training, thereby maximizing the projection of full-parameter gradients into the adapter subspace. This alignment sharply reduces information loss at initialization, yields a lower starting loss, and accelerates convergence. We demonstrate ABM-LoRA's effectiveness across diverse architectures and tasks: language understanding (T5-Base on GLUE), dialogue generation (LLaMA2-7B on WizardLM), and vision recognition (ViT-B/16 on VTAB-1K).

Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs) have introduced new opportunities for leveraging external semantic knowledge to guide SFDA. However, relying on a single FM is often insufficient, as it tends to bias adaptation toward a restricted semantic coverage, failing to capture diverse contextual cues under domain shift. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Collaborative Multi-foundation Adaptation (CoMA) framework that jointly leverages two different FMs (e.g., CLIP and BLIP) with complementary properties to capture both global semantics and local contextual cues. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional adaptation mechanism that (1) aligns different FMs with the target model for task adaptation while maintaining their semantic distinctiveness, and (2) transfers complementary knowledge from the FMs to the target model. To ensure stable adaptation under mini-batch training, we introduce Decomposed Mutual Information (DMI) that selectively enhances true dependencies while suppressing false dependencies arising from incomplete class coverage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SFDA methods across four benchmarks, including Office-31, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, and VisDA, under the closed-set setting, while also achieving best results on partial-set and open-set variants."}

The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation."}

This highlights the critical need to enhance restoration quality and adapt flexibly to various image restoration tasks or backbones without requiring model retraining and ideally without labor-intensive preference data collection. In this paper, we propose the first Test-Time Preference Optimization (TTPO) paradigm for image restoration, which enhances perceptual quality, generates preference data on-the-fly, and is compatible with any IR model backbone. Specifically, we design a training-free, three-stage pipeline: (i) generate candidate preference images online using diffusion inversion and denoising based on the initially restored image; (ii) select preferred and dispreferred images using automated preference-aligned metrics or human feedback; and (iii) use the selected preference images as reward signals to guide the diffusion denoising process, optimizing the restored image to better align with human preferences.

Our method is built upon a distributed 2D Gaussian Splatting representation as the core foundation, serving as a unified backbone for subsequent modules. To handle potential sparse regions in complex scenes, we propose a structured dense enhancement scheme that utilizes SfM priors and a pointmap model to achieve a denser initialization, while incorporating a sparsity compensation mechanism to improve reconstruction completeness. Furthermore, we design a progressive hybrid geometric optimization strategy that organically integrates monocular and multi-view optimization to achieve efficient and accurate geometric refinement. Finally, to address the appearance inconsistency commonly observed in large-scale scenes, we introduce a depth-guided appearance modeling approach that learns spatial features with 3D consistency, facilitating effective decoupling between geometry and appearance and further enhancing reconstruction stability.

Active Learning (AL) aims to mitigate this challenge by querying only the most informative samples, thereby reducing annotation effort. However, in the domain of 3D biomedical imaging, there is no consensus on whether AL consistently outperforms Random sampling. Four evaluation pitfalls hinder the current methodological assessment. These are (1) restriction to too few datasets and annotation budgets, (2) using 2D models on 3D images without partial annotations, (3) Random baseline not being adapted to the task, and (4) measuring annotation cost only in voxels. In this work, we introduce nnActive, an open-source AL framework that overcomes these pitfalls by (1) means of a large scale study spanning four biomedical imaging datasets and three label regimes, (2) extending nnU-Net by using partial annotations for training with 3D patch-based query selection, (3) proposing Foreground Aware Random sampling strategies tackling the foreground-background class imbalance of medical images and (4) propose the foreground efficiency metric, which captures the low annotation cost of background-regions. We reveal the following findings: (A) while all AL methods outperform standard Random sampling, none reliably surpasses an improved Foreground Aware Random sampling; (B) benefits of AL depend on task specific parameters; (C) Predictive Entropy is overall the best performing AL method, but likely requires the most annotation effort; (D) AL performance can be improved with more compute intensive design choices. As a holistic, open-source framework, nnActive can serve as a catalyst for research and application of AL in 3D biomedical imaging. Code is at: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnActive"}

To overcome these challenges, we present a novel workflow for automated 3D anatomical data generation using data obtained from physical organ models. We additionally use a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to obtain a manifold of 3D models useful for other downstream machine learning tasks that rely on 3D data. We demonstrate our workflow using an artificial prostate model made of biomimetic hydrogels with imaging contrast in multiple zones. This is used to physically simulate endoscopic surgery. For evaluation and 3D data generation, we place it into a customized ultrasound scanner that records the prostate before and after the procedure. A neural network is trained to segment the recorded ultrasound images, which outperforms conventional, non-learning-based computer vision techniques in terms of intersection over union (IoU).

Many failures arise from inaccuracies and instability, especially in long-tail scenarios and complex interactions.

To address these challenges, we introduce Percept-WAM, a perception-enhanced World-Awareness-Action Model that is the first to implicitly integrate 2D/3D scene understanding abilities within a single vision-language model (VLM). Instead of relying on QA-style spatial reasoning, Percept-WAM unifies 2D/3D perception tasks into World-PV and World-BEV tokens, which encode both spatial coordinates and confidence. We propose a grid-conditioned prediction mechanism for dense object perception, incorporating IoU-aware scoring and parallel autoregressive decoding, improving stability in long-tail, far-range, and small-object scenarios. Additionally, Percept-WAM leverages pretrained VLM parameters to retain general intelligence (e.g., logical reasoning) and can output perception results and trajectory control outputs directly. Experiments show that Percept-WAM matches or surpasses classical detectors and segmenters on downstream perception benchmarks, achieving 51.7/58.9 mAP on COCO 2D detection and nuScenes BEV 3D detection.

Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance.

We present IDSplat, a self-supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reconstructs dynamic scenes with explicit instance decomposition and learnable motion trajectories, without requiring human annotations. Our key insight is to model dynamic objects as coherent instances undergoing rigid transformations, rather than unstructured time-varying primitives. For instance decomposition, we employ zero-shot, language-grounded video tracking anchored to 3D using lidar, and estimate consistent poses via feature correspondences. We introduce a coordinated-turn smoothing scheme to obtain temporally and physically consistent motion trajectories, mitigating pose misalignments and tracking failures, followed by joint optimization of object poses and Gaussian parameters.

Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent. We analyze the factors influencing attack success, discuss implications for the security of automated logistics pipelines, and highlight directions for strengthening physical robustness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate adversarial patch attacks for cargo-occupancy estimation in physically realistic, fully simulated 3D scenes."}

Recent work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle to understand 3D space and long videos, although they are powerful in typical vision-language tasks. Current methods often rely on specialized architectural designs to improve performance for 3D tasks and video understanding tasks separately. In contrast, we propose LAST, short for LeArn to Think in Space and Time, to jointly improve 3D spatial and long video understanding for general VLMs with only a set of 2D images as inputs. LAST makes VLMs think in space and time rather than only with text before giving the final answer, building visual thinking trajectories in 3D space and temporal dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAST in two scenarios: 1) zero-shot, where we directly prompt proprietary models; and 2) fine-tuning general VLMs with data that include thinking trajectories in 3D space and time. We show that LAST brings substantial gains in various benchmarks, including 3 spatial understanding, 4 video understanding, and 3 image understanding tasks.

Addressing these conflicts requires nuanced solutions, which standard supervised fine-tuning struggles to provide. Preference-based optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) show promise but are limited by gradient entanglement between text and condition signals and lack disentangled training data for multi-constraint tasks. To overcome this, we propose a bidirectionally decoupled DPO framework (BideDPO). Our method creates two disentangled preference pairs-one for the condition and one for the text-to reduce gradient entanglement. The influence of pairs is managed using an Adaptive Loss Balancing strategy for balanced optimization. We introduce an automated data pipeline to sample model outputs and generate conflict-aware data. This process is embedded in an iterative optimization strategy that refines both the model and the data. We construct a DualAlign benchmark to evaluate conflict resolution between text and condition.

Specifically, we establish a formal connection between reconstruction error and data likelihood, grounded in the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of Markovian diffusion processes, thereby enabling a principled, distribution-aware scoring criterion for data selection. Complementarily, we introduce an efficient information-theoretic method to identify the optimal reconstruction timestep, ensuring that the deviation provides a reliable signal indicative of underlying data likelihood. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that reconstruction deviation offers an effective scoring criterion, consistently outperforming existing baselines across selection ratios, and closely matching full-data training using only 50% of the data. Further analysis shows that the likelihood-informed nature of our score reveals informative insights in data selection, shedding light on the interplay between data distributional characteristics and model learning preferences."}

The matching stage uses the same MLLM to autoregressively decide relevance from multi-view inputs, including both raw data and its own projected embeddings for each query and document. It provides instance-wise discrimination supervision that complements a standard contrastive loss, offering stronger gradients on hard negatives and preserving the compositional strengths of the original MLLM. To obtain semantically richer multimodal embeddings, we use multiple learnable tokens to augment each input, generating fine-grained contextual, mutually orthogonal embeddings with low inference cost. Leveraging our established high-performance baseline,we assemble the ideas mentioned above into a powerful training recipe and achieve a new state-of-the-art on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB).

Yet, achieving reliable 3D understanding from monocular images requires substantial annotation, and 3D labels are especially costly. To maximize performance under constrained labeling budgets, it is essential to prioritize annotating samples expected to deliver the largest performance gains. This prioritization is the focus of active learning. Curiously, we observed two significant limitations in active learning algorithms for 3D monocular object detection. First, previous approaches select entire images, which is inefficient, as non-informative instances contained in the same image also need to be labeled. Secondly, existing methods rely on uncertainty-based selection, which in monocular 3D object detection creates a bias toward depth ambiguity. Consequently, distant objects are selected, while nearby objects are overlooked.\n  To address these limitations, we propose IDEAL-M3D, the first instance-level pipeline for monocular 3D detection. For the first time, we demonstrate that an explicitly diverse, fast-to-train ensemble improves diversity-driven active learning for monocular 3D. We induce diversity with heterogeneous backbones and task-agnostic features, loss weight perturbation, and time-dependent bagging. IDEAL-M3D shows superior performance and significant resource savings: with just 60% of the annotations, we achieve similar or better AP3D on KITTI validation and test set results compared to training the same detector on the whole dataset."}

Our approach integrates dual-granularity semantic prompts: coarse-grained textual priors (e.g., 'infrared image', 'small target') and fine-grained personalized semantic descriptions derived through visual-to-textual mapping within the image space. This design not only facilitates learning fine-grained semantic information but also can inherently leverage language prompts during inference without relying on any annotation requirements. By fully leveraging the precision and conciseness of text descriptions, we further introduce a text-guide channel attention (TGCA) mechanism and text-guide spatial attention (TGSA) mechanism that enhances the model's sensitivity to potential targets across both low- and high-level feature spaces.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce SyncMV4D, the first model that jointly generates synchronized multi-view HOI videos and 4D motions by unifying visual prior, motion dynamics, and multi-view geometry. Our framework features two core innovations: (1) a Multi-view Joint Diffusion (MJD) model that co-generates HOI videos and intermediate motions, and (2) a Diffusion Points Aligner (DPA) that refines the coarse intermediate motion into globally aligned 4D metric point tracks. To tightly couple 2D appearance with 4D dynamics, we establish a closed-loop, mutually enhancing cycle. During the diffusion denoising process, the generated video conditions the refinement of the 4D motion, while the aligned 4D point tracks are reprojected to guide next-step joint generation.

Some methods attempt to mitigate this problem by imposing constraints on entropy, but none address it at its root. Therefore, to tackle this problem, this work proposes Syn-GRPO (Synthesis-GRPO), which employs an online data generator to synthesize high-quality training data with diverse responses in GRPO training.

The data server synthesizes new samples from existing ones using an image generation model, featuring a decoupled and asynchronous scheme to achieve high generation efficiency. The GRPO workflow provides the data server with the new image descriptions, and it leverages a diversity reward to supervise the MLLM to predict image descriptions for synthesizing samples with diverse responses. Experiment results across three visual perception tasks demonstrate that Syn-GRPO improves the data quality by a large margin, achieving significant superior performance to existing MLLM perception methods, and Syn-GRPO presents promising potential for scaling long-term self-evolving RL.

However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature.

Most prior work tackles this challenge by either designing better architectures, loss functions, or data augmentation schemes; and collecting more labeled data. We take a different view, arguing that part of the problem lies in how the background is modeled. Common lesion segmentation collapses all non-lesion pixels into a single \"background\" class, ignoring the rich anatomical context in which lesions appear. In reality, the background is highly heterogeneous-composed of tissues, organs, and other structures that can now be labeled manually or inferred automatically using existing segmentation models.\n  In this paper, we argue that training with fine-grained labels that sub-divide the background class, which we call BackSplit, is a simple yet powerful paradigm that can offer a significant performance boost without increasing inference costs. From an information theoretic standpoint, we prove that BackSplit increases the expected Fisher Information relative to conventional binary training, leading to tighter asymptotic bounds and more stable optimization. With extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures, we empirically show that BackSplit consistently boosts small-lesion segmentation performance, even when auxiliary labels are generated automatically using pretrained segmentation models. Additionally, we demonstrate that auxiliary labels derived from interactive segmentation frameworks exhibit the same beneficial effect, demonstrating its robustness, simplicity, and broad applicability."}

In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art generators, including Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2, show that video models can reliably interpret and execute such visually embedded instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios."}

This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence."}

However, previous generations-including SAM and its successor-still struggle with fine-grained, low-level segmentation challenges such as camouflaged object detection, medical image segmentation, cell image segmentation, and shadow detection. To address these limitations, we originally proposed SAM-Adapter in 2023, demonstrating substantial gains on these difficult scenarios. With the emergence of Segment Anything 3 (SAM3)-a more efficient and higher-performing evolution with a redesigned architecture and improved training pipeline-we revisit these long-standing challenges. In this work, we present SAM3-Adapter, the first adapter framework tailored for SAM3 that unlocks its full segmentation capability. SAM3-Adapter not only reduces computational overhead but also consistently surpasses both SAM and SAM2-based solutions, establishing new state-of-the-art results across multiple downstream tasks, including medical imaging, camouflaged (concealed) object segmentation, and shadow detection. Built upon the modular and composable design philosophy of the original SAM-Adapter, SAM3-Adapter provides stronger generalizability, richer task adaptability, and significantly improved segmentation precision. Extensive experiments confirm that integrating SAM3 with our adapter yields superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency compared to all prior SAM-based adaptations. We hope SAM3-Adapter can serve as a foundation for future research and practical segmentation applications. Code, pre-trained models, and data processing pipelines are available."}

The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/GRANT}", "summary": "Task scheduling is critical for embodied AI, enabling agents to follow natural language instructions and execute actions efficiently in 3D physical worlds. However, existing datasets often simplify task planning by ignoring operations research (OR) knowledge and 3D spatial grounding. In this work, we propose Operations Research knowledge-based 3D Grounded Task Scheduling (ORS3D), a new task that requires the synergy of language understanding, 3D grounding, and efficiency optimization. Unlike prior settings, ORS3D demands that agents minimize total completion time by leveraging parallelizable subtasks, e.g., cleaning the sink while the microwave operates. To facilitate research on ORS3D, we construct ORS3D-60K, a large-scale dataset comprising 60K composite tasks across 4K real-world scenes. Furthermore, we propose GRANT, an embodied multi-modal large language model equipped with a simple yet effective scheduling token mechanism to generate efficient task schedules and grounded actions. Extensive experiments on ORS3D-60K validate the effectiveness of GRANT across language understanding, 3D grounding, and scheduling efficiency.

However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($<10\\%$) against collocated radar measurements.

Stich", "Andrea Dittadi"], "title": "Breaking the Likelihood-Quality Trade-off in Diffusion Models by Merging Pretrained Experts", "comment": "ICLR 2025 DeLTa workshop", "summary": "Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models."}

We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning."}

Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs.

To this end, we propose LumiTex, an end-to-end framework that comprises three key components: (1) a multi-branch generation scheme that disentangles albedo and metallic-roughness under shared illumination priors for robust material understanding, (2) a lighting-aware material attention mechanism that injects illumination context into the decoding process for physically grounded generation of albedo, metallic, and roughness maps, and (3) a geometry-guided inpainting module based on a large view synthesis model that enriches texture coverage and ensures seamless, view-consistent UV completion.

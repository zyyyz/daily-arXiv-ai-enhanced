Traditional datasets are\nrestricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for\nreal-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related\nto realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually\nrelevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more\nclosely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone\ndetermination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that\nsimplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized\nrecognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision\npoints along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical\nframework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments,\nfacilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway\nautomation."}

Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning\n(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and\npredicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the\nactual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct\nsupervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to\nlink the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the\nlow-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the\nformer, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in\nthe patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the\npresence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels\ncan be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution\nlabels provide us only one label.

The effectiveness\nof these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on\nestablished benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after\ncompression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the\nperception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate\ncompression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token\ncompression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals\nthat simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced\ncompression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive\nexperiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are\nnoisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to\nserve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual\ntoken compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an\nevaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise\nexisting benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of\nvisual token compression methods.

Nevertheless, current methods primarily\nconcentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while\nstruggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on\nhuman-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for\ncreating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To\nachieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset\nand incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the\ncamera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which\neffectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To\nmaintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view\nhuman-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference\nvideo, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a\nrobust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates\nthe artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation.

Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL\nmodels through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices\nimprove transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically\ntested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across\nseven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:\nViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and\n1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The\nprimary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2\nachieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to\n512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and\nImageNet.

We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior\ncovariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for\nOOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace\niteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward\nevaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,\nwith up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline.

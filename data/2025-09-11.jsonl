At the same time, the absence of a standardized\ndefinition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and\nsometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these\ngaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D\nand 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,\nintroduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),\noccupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and\nsystematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D\nsettings.

By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can\nserve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,\nwhere access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection\nand timely intervention."}

We analyze the accuracy of an\nEBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for\ncomparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities\nwhich are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera\nstatic and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we\ncreate a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame\nis that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is\nprocessed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the\nInternational Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation\nof the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared\nacross error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.\nCombined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced\ncomputation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy\nconsumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility\nof event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking.

State-of-the-art methods\ntypically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent\nhypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases\n-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong\nzoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source\nlocations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent\nhypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In\nthis paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent\nhypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search\nstrategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating\nthese multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel\ndense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and\npropagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more\nrobust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or\nwhen the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image."}

It primarily due to fundamental limitations in\nexisting approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input\nmodality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally\nmisaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization\nprocess is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the\nreward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes\nthese barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the\nreward score as the model's probability of predicting a \"yes\" token, indicating\nthat the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific\ncriteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM\narchitectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model\nScaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context\nScaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nRewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,\ntext-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the\npersistent challenge of \"reward hacking\": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and\nmaintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance\nto hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly\nrelieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models."}

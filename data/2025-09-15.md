Abstract: This paper introduces the Australian Supermarket Object Set (ASOS), a
comprehensive dataset comprising 50 readily available supermarket items with
high-quality 3D textured meshes designed for benchmarking in robotics and
computer vision applications. Unlike existing datasets that rely on synthetic
models or specialized objects with limited accessibility, ASOS provides a
cost-effective collection of common household items that can be sourced from a
major Australian supermarket chain. The dataset spans 10 distinct categories
with diverse shapes, sizes, and weights. 3D meshes are acquired by a
structure-from-motion techniques with high-resolution imaging to generate
watertight meshes. The dataset's emphasis on accessibility and real-world
applicability makes it valuable for benchmarking object detection, pose
estimation, and robotics applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: After natural disasters, accurate evaluations of damage to housing are
important for insurance claims response and planning of resources. In this
work, we introduce a novel multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG)
framework. On top of classical RAG architecture, we further the framework to
devise a two-branch multimodal encoder structure that the image branch employs
a visual encoder composed of ResNet and Transformer to extract the
characteristic of building damage after disaster, and the text branch harnesses
a BERT retriever for the text vectorization of posts as well as insurance
policies and for the construction of a retrievable restoration index. To impose
cross-modal semantic alignment, the model integrates a cross-modal interaction
module to bridge the semantic representation between image and text via
multi-head attention. Meanwhile, in the generation module, the introduced modal
attention gating mechanism dynamically controls the role of visual evidence and
text prior information during generation. The entire framework takes end-to-end
training, and combines the comparison loss, the retrieval loss and the
generation loss to form multi-task optimization objectives, and achieves image
understanding and policy matching in collaborative learning. The results
demonstrate superior performance in retrieval accuracy and classification index
on damage severity, where the Top-1 retrieval accuracy has been improved by
9.6%.

Abstract: We present a novel ensemble framework that stabilizes LLM based text
extraction from noisy historical documents. We transcribe multiple augmented
variants of each image with Gemini 2.0 Flash and fuse these outputs with a
custom Needleman Wunsch style aligner that yields both a consensus
transcription and a confidence score. We present a new dataset of 622
Pennsylvania death records, and demonstrate our method improves transcription
accuracy by 4 percentage points relative to a single shot baseline. We find
that padding and blurring are the most useful for improving accuracy, while
grid warp perturbations are best for separating high and low confidence cases.
The approach is simple, scalable, and immediately deployable to other document
collections and transcription models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: General-domain large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant
advances in various image-text tasks. However, their performance in the
Intelligent Traffic Surveillance (ITS) domain remains limited due to the
absence of dedicated multimodal datasets. To address this gap, we introduce
MITS (Multimodal Intelligent Traffic Surveillance), the first large-scale
multimodal benchmark dataset specifically designed for ITS. MITS includes
170,400 independently collected real-world ITS images sourced from traffic
surveillance cameras, annotated with eight main categories and 24 subcategories
of ITS-specific objects and events under diverse environmental conditions.
Additionally, through a systematic data generation pipeline, we generate
high-quality image captions and 5 million instruction-following visual
question-answer pairs, addressing five critical ITS tasks: object and event
recognition, object counting, object localization, background analysis, and
event reasoning. To demonstrate MITS's effectiveness, we fine-tune mainstream
LMMs on this dataset, enabling the development of ITS-specific applications.
Experimental results show that MITS significantly improves LMM performance in
ITS applications, increasing LLaVA-1.5's performance from 0.494 to 0.905
(+83.2%), LLaVA-1.6's from 0.678 to 0.921 (+35.8%), Qwen2-VL's from 0.584 to
0.926 (+58.6%), and Qwen2.5-VL's from 0.732 to 0.930 (+27.0%). We release the
dataset, code, and models as open-source, providing high-value resources to
advance both ITS and LMM research.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel at zero-shot visual classification, but
their performance on fine-grained tasks and large hierarchical label spaces is
understudied. This paper investigates whether structured, tree-based reasoning
can enhance VLM performance. We introduce a framework that decomposes
classification into interpretable decisions using decision trees and evaluates
it on fine-grained (GTSRB) and coarse-grained (CIFAR-10) datasets. Although the
model achieves 98.2% accuracy in understanding the tree knowledge, tree-based
reasoning consistently underperforms standard zero-shot prompting. We also
explore enhancing the tree prompts with LLM-generated classes and image
descriptions to improve alignment. The added description enhances the
performance of the tree-based and zero-shot methods. Our findings highlight
limitations of structured reasoning in visual classification and offer insights
for designing more interpretable VLM systems.

Abstract: We present Probabilistic Structure Integration (PSI), a system for learning
richly controllable and flexibly promptable world models from data. PSI
consists of a three-step cycle. The first step, Probabilistic prediction,
involves building a probabilistic graphical model Psi of the data, in the form
of a random-access autoregressive sequence model. Psi supports a complete set
of learned conditional distributions describing the dependence of any variables
in the data on any other set of variables. In step 2, Structure extraction, we
show how to extract underlying low-dimensional properties in the data,
corresponding to a diverse set of meaningful "intermediate structures", in a
zero-shot fashion via causal inference on Psi. Step 3, Integration, completes
the cycle by converting these structures into new token types that are then
continually mixed back into the training diet as conditioning signals and
prediction targets. Each such cycle augments the capabilities of Psi, both
allowing it to model the underlying data better, and creating new control
handles -- akin to an LLM-like universal prompting language. We train an
instance of Psi on 1.4 trillion tokens of internet video data; we use it to
perform a variety of useful video prediction and understanding inferences; we
extract state-of-the-art optical flow, self-supervised depth and object
segmentation; and we use these structures to support a full cycle of predictive
improvements.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple entities to train a shared model
collaboratively. Its core, privacy-preserving principle is that participants
only exchange model updates, such as gradients, and never their raw, sensitive
data. This approach is fundamental for applications in domains where privacy
and confidentiality are important. However, the security of this very mechanism
is threatened by gradient inversion attacks, which can reverse-engineer private
training data directly from the shared gradients, defeating the purpose of FL.
While the impact of these attacks is known for image, text, and tabular data,
their effect on video data remains an unexamined area of research. This paper
presents the first analysis of video data leakage in FL using gradient
inversion attacks. We evaluate two common video classification approaches: one
employing pre-trained feature extractors and another that processes raw video
frames with simple transformations. Our initial results indicate that the use
of feature extractors offers greater resilience against gradient inversion
attacks. We also demonstrate that image super-resolution techniques can enhance
the frames extracted through gradient inversion attacks, enabling attackers to
reconstruct higher-quality videos. Our experiments validate this across
scenarios where the attacker has access to zero, one, or more reference frames
from the target environment. We find that although feature extractors make
attacks more challenging, leakage is still possible if the classifier lacks
sufficient complexity. We, therefore, conclude that video data leakage in FL is
a viable threat, and the conditions under which it occurs warrant further
investigation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study proposes a semi-supervised co-training framework for object
detection in densely packed retail environments, where limited labeled data and
complex conditions pose major challenges. The framework combines Faster R-CNN
(utilizing a ResNet backbone) for precise localization with YOLO (employing a
Darknet backbone) for global context, enabling mutual pseudo-label exchange
that improves accuracy in scenes with occlusion and overlapping objects. To
strengthen classification, it employs an ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest,
and SVM, utilizing diverse feature representations for higher robustness.
Hyperparameters are optimized using a metaheuristic-driven algorithm, enhancing
precision and efficiency across models. By minimizing reliance on manual
labeling, the approach reduces annotation costs and adapts effectively to
frequent product and layout changes common in retail. Experiments on the
SKU-110k dataset demonstrate strong performance, highlighting the scalability
and practicality of the proposed framework for real-world retail applications
such as automated inventory tracking, product monitoring, and checkout systems.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) is crucial for mitigating performance degradation
caused by distribution shifts in 3D point cloud classification. In this work,
we introduce Token Purging (PG), a novel backpropagation-free approach that
removes tokens highly affected by domain shifts before they reach attention
layers. Unlike existing TTA methods, PG operates at the token level, ensuring
robust adaptation without iterative updates. We propose two variants: PG-SP,
which leverages source statistics, and PG-SF, a fully source-free version
relying on CLS-token-driven adaptation. Extensive evaluations on ModelNet40-C,
ShapeNet-C, and ScanObjectNN-C demonstrate that PG-SP achieves an average of
+10.3\% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art backpropagation-free methods,
while PG-SF sets new benchmarks for source-free adaptation. Moreover, PG is
12.4 times faster and 5.5 times more memory efficient than our baseline, making
it suitable for real-world deployment. Code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose an accurate and highly interpretable fine-grained cross-view
localization method that estimates the 3 Degrees of Freedom pose of a
ground-level image by matching its local features with a reference aerial
image. Previous methods typically transform the ground image into a bird's-eye
view (BEV) representation and then align it with the aerial image for
localization. However, this transformation often leads to information loss due
to perspective distortion or compression of height information, thereby
degrading alignment quality with the aerial view. In contrast, our method
directly establishes correspondences between ground and aerial images and lifts
only the matched keypoints to BEV space using monocular depth prior. Notably,
modern depth predictors can provide reliable metric depth when the test samples
are similar to the training data. When the depth distribution differs, they
still produce consistent relative depth, i.e., depth accurate up to an unknown
scale. Our method supports both metric and relative depth. It employs a
scale-aware Procrustes alignment to estimate the camera pose from the
correspondences and optionally recover the scale when using relative depth.
Experimental results demonstrate that, with only weak supervision on camera
pose, our method learns accurate local feature correspondences and achieves
superior localization performance under challenging conditions, such as
cross-area generalization and unknown orientation. Moreover, our method is
compatible with various relative depth models without requiring per-model
finetuning. This flexibility, combined with strong localization performance,
makes it well-suited for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Numerous visual impairments can be detected in red-eye reflex images from
young children. The so-called Bruckner test is traditionally performed by
ophthalmologists in clinical settings. Thanks to the recent technological
advances in smartphones and artificial intelligence, it is now possible to
recreate the Bruckner test using a mobile device. In this paper, we present a
first study conducted during the development of KidsVisionCheck, a free
application that can perform vision screening with a mobile device using
red-eye reflex images. The underlying model relies on deep neural networks
trained on children's pupil images collected and labeled by an ophthalmologist.
With an accuracy of 90% on unseen test data, our model provides highly reliable
performance without the necessity of specialist equipment. Furthermore, we can
identify the optimal conditions for data collection, which can in turn be used
to provide immediate feedback to the users. In summary, this work marks a first
step toward accessible pediatric vision screenings and early intervention for
vision abnormalities worldwide.

Abstract: Robust semantic perception for autonomous vehicles relies on effectively
combining multiple sensors with complementary strengths and weaknesses.
State-of-the-art sensor fusion approaches to semantic perception often treat
sensor data uniformly across the spatial extent of the input, which hinders
performance when faced with challenging conditions. By contrast, we propose a
novel depth-guided multimodal fusion method that upgrades condition-aware
fusion by integrating depth information. Our network, DGFusion, poses
multimodal segmentation as a multi-task problem, utilizing the lidar
measurements, which are typically available in outdoor sensor suites, both as
one of the model's inputs and as ground truth for learning depth. Our
corresponding auxiliary depth head helps to learn depth-aware features, which
are encoded into spatially varying local depth tokens that condition our
attentive cross-modal fusion. Together with a global condition token, these
local depth tokens dynamically adapt sensor fusion to the spatially varying
reliability of each sensor across the scene, which largely depends on depth. In
addition, we propose a robust loss for our depth, which is essential for
learning from lidar inputs that are typically sparse and noisy in adverse
conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art panoptic and semantic
segmentation performance on the challenging MUSES and DELIVER datasets. Code

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Rosacea, which is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that manifests with
facial redness, papules, and visible blood vessels, often requirs precise and
early detection for significantly improving treatment effectiveness. This paper
presents new patch-based automatic rosacea detection strategies using the
ResNet-18 deep learning framework. The contributions of the proposed strategies
come from the following aspects. First, various image pateches are extracted
from the facial images of people in different sizes, shapes, and locations.
Second, a number of investigation studies are carried out to evaluate how the
localized visual information influences the deep learing model performance.
Third, thorough experiments are implemented to reveal that several patch-based
automatic rosacea detection strategies achieve competitive or superior accuracy
and sensitivity than the full-image based methods. And finally, the proposed
patch-based strategies, which use only localized patches, inherently preserve
patient privacy by excluding any identifiable facial features from the data.
The experimental results indicate that the proposed patch-based strategies
guide the deep learning model to focus on clinically relevant regions, enhance
robustness and interpretability, and protect patient privacy. As a result, the
proposed strategies offer practical insights for improving automated
dermatological diagnostics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Rosacea is a common but underdiagnosed inflammatory skin condition that
primarily affects the central face and presents with subtle redness, pustules,
and visible blood vessels. Automated detection remains challenging due to the
diffuse nature of symptoms, the scarcity of labeled datasets, and privacy
concerns associated with using identifiable facial images. A novel
privacy-preserving automated rosacea detection method inspired by clinical
priors and trained entirely on synthetic data is presented in this paper.
Specifically, the proposed method, which leverages the observation that rosacea
manifests predominantly through central facial erythema, first constructs a
fixed redness-informed mask by selecting regions with consistently high red
channel intensity across facial images. The mask thus is able to focus on
diagnostically relevant areas such as the cheeks, nose, and forehead and
exclude identity-revealing features. Second, the ResNet-18 deep learning
method, which is trained on the masked synthetic images, achieves superior
performance over the full-face baselines with notable gains in terms of
accuracy, recall and F1 score when evaluated using the real-world test data.
The experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data and clinical
priors can jointly enable accurate and ethical dermatological AI systems,
especially for privacy sensitive applications in telemedicine and large-scale
screening.

Abstract: To rigorously assess the effectiveness and necessity of individual components
within the recently proposed ULW framework for laparoscopic image desmoking,
this paper presents a comprehensive ablation study. The ULW approach combines a

framework also incorporates a differentiable, learnable Wiener filter module.
In this study, each component is systematically ablated to evaluate its
specific contribution to the overall performance of the whole framework. The
analysis includes: (1) removal of the learnable Wiener filter, (2) selective
use of individual loss terms from the composite loss function. All variants are
benchmarked on a publicly available paired laparoscopic images dataset using
quantitative metrics (SSIM, PSNR, MSE and CIEDE-2000) alongside qualitative

Abstract: We introduce a multi-modal WAVE-DETR drone detector combining visible RGB and

visual and acoustic features in a unified object detector model relying on the
Deformable DETR and Wav2Vec2 architectures, achieving strong performance under
challenging environmental conditions. Our work leverage the existing
Drone-vs-Bird dataset and the newly generated ARDrone dataset containing more
than 7,500 synchronized images and audio segments. We show how the acoustic
information is used to improve the performance of the Deformable DETR object
detector on the real ARDrone dataset. We developed, trained and tested four
different fusion configurations based on a gated mechanism, linear layer, MLP
and cross attention. The Wav2Vec2 acoustic embeddings are fused with the multi
resolution feature mappings of the Deformable DETR and enhance the object
detection performance over all drones dimensions. The best performer is the
gated fusion approach, which improves the mAP of the Deformable DETR object
detector on our in-distribution and out-of-distribution ARDrone datasets by
11.1% to 15.3% for small drones across all IoU thresholds between 0.5 and 0.9.
The mAP scores for medium and large drones are also enhanced, with overall
gains across all drone sizes ranging from 3.27% to 5.84%.

Abstract: Objective: Deep learning-based deformable image registration has achieved
strong accuracy, but remains sensitive to variations in input image
characteristics such as artifacts, field-of-view mismatch, or modality
difference. We aim to develop a general training paradigm that improves the
robustness and generalizability of registration networks. Methods: We introduce
surrogate supervision, which decouples the input domain from the supervision
domain by applying estimated spatial transformations to surrogate images. This
allows training on heterogeneous inputs while ensuring supervision is computed
in domains where similarity is well defined. We evaluate the framework through
three representative applications: artifact-robust brain MR registration,
mask-agnostic lung CT registration, and multi-modal MR registration. Results:
Across tasks, surrogate supervision demonstrated strong resilience to input
variations including inhomogeneity field, inconsistent field-of-view, and
modality differences, while maintaining high performance on well-curated data.
Conclusions: Surrogate supervision provides a principled framework for training
robust and generalizable deep learning-based registration models without
increasing complexity. Significance: Surrogate supervision offers a practical
pathway to more robust and generalizable medical image registration, enabling
broader applicability in diverse biomedical imaging scenarios.

Abstract: The practical adoption of deep learning in high-stakes forensic applications,
such as dental age estimation, is often limited by the 'black box' nature of
the models. This study introduces a framework designed to enhance both
performance and transparency in this context. We use a notable performance
disparity in the automated staging of mandibular second (tooth 37) and third
(tooth 38) molars as a case study. The proposed framework, which combines a
convolutional autoencoder (AE) with a Vision Transformer (ViT), improves
classification accuracy for both teeth over a baseline ViT, increasing from
0.712 to 0.815 for tooth 37 and from 0.462 to 0.543 for tooth 38. Beyond
improving performance, the framework provides multi-faceted diagnostic
insights. Analysis of the AE's latent space metrics and image reconstructions
indicates that the remaining performance gap is data-centric, suggesting high
intra-class morphological variability in the tooth 38 dataset is a primary
limiting factor. This work highlights the insufficiency of relying on a single
mode of interpretability, such as attention maps, which can appear anatomically
plausible yet fail to identify underlying data issues. By offering a
methodology that both enhances accuracy and provides evidence for why a model
may be uncertain, this framework serves as a more robust tool to support expert
decision-making in forensic age estimation.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) addresses the challenge of adapting a
model to a target domain without access to the data of the source domain.
Prevailing methods typically start with a source model pre-trained with full
supervision and distill the knowledge by aligning instance-level features.
However, these approaches, relying on cosine similarity over L2-normalized
feature vectors, inadvertently discard crucial geometric information about the
latent manifold of the source model. We introduce Self-supervised Continual
Domain Adaptation (SCoDA) to address these limitations. We make two key
departures from standard practice: first, we avoid the reliance on supervised
pre-training by initializing the proposed framework with a teacher model
pre-trained entirely via self-supervision (SSL). Second, we adapt the principle
of geometric manifold alignment to the SFDA setting. The student is trained
with a composite objective combining instance-level feature matching with a
Space Similarity Loss. To combat catastrophic forgetting, the teacher's
parameters are updated via an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the student's
parameters. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SCoDA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods.

Abstract: Tracking cells and detecting mitotic events in time-lapse microscopy image
sequences is a crucial task in biomedical research. However, it remains highly
challenging due to dividing objects, low signal-tonoise ratios, indistinct
boundaries, dense clusters, and the visually similar appearance of individual
cells. Existing deep learning-based methods rely on manually labeled datasets
for training, which is both costly and time-consuming. Moreover, their
generalizability to unseen datasets remains limited due to the vast diversity
of microscopy data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a zero-shot cell
tracking framework by integrating Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), a large foundation
model designed for general image and video segmentation, into the tracking
pipeline. As a fully-unsupervised approach, our method does not depend on or
inherit biases from any specific training dataset, allowing it to generalize
across diverse microscopy datasets without finetuning. Our approach achieves
competitive accuracy in both 2D and large-scale 3D time-lapse microscopy videos
while eliminating the need for dataset-specific adaptation.

task for automating large-scale surveillance. With camera calibration and depth
information, the targets in the scene can be projected into 3D space, offering
unparalleled levels of automatic perception of a 3D environment. However,
tracking in the 3D space requires replacing all 2D tracking components from the
ground up, which may be infeasible for existing MTMC systems. In this paper, we
present an approach for extending any online 2D multi-camera tracking system
into 3D space by utilizing depth information to reconstruct a target in
point-cloud space, and recovering its 3D box through clustering and yaw
refinement following tracking. We also introduced an enhanced online data
association mechanism that leverages the target's local ID consistency to
assign global IDs across frames. The proposed framework is evaluated on the
2025 AI City Challenge's 3D MTMC dataset, achieving 3rd place on the
leaderboard.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is usually addressed with
task-trained grounding models. We show that a zero-shot workflow, without any
REC-specific training, can achieve competitive or superior performance. Our
approach reformulates REC as box-wise visual-language verification: given
proposals from a COCO-clean generic detector (YOLO-World), a general-purpose
VLM independently answers True/False queries for each region. This simple
procedure reduces cross-box interference, supports abstention and multiple
matches, and requires no fine-tuning. On RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, our
method not only surpasses a zero-shot GroundingDINO baseline but also exceeds
reported results for GroundingDINO trained on REC and GroundingDINO+CRG.
Controlled studies with identical proposals confirm that verification
significantly outperforms selection-based prompting, and results hold with open
VLMs. Overall, we show that workflow design, rather than task-specific
pretraining, drives strong zero-shot REC performance.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of foliar diseases and insect damage in wheat is
crucial for effective crop management and disease control. However, the insect
damage typically occupies only a tiny fraction of annotated pixels. This
extreme pixel-level imbalance poses a significant challenge to the segmentation
performance, which can result in overfitting to common classes and insufficient
learning of rare classes, thereby impairing overall performance. In this paper,
we propose a Random Projected Copy-and-Paste (RPCP) augmentation technique to
address the pixel imbalance problem. Specifically, we extract rare
insect-damage patches from annotated training images and apply random geometric
transformations to simulate variations. The transformed patches are then pasted
in appropriate regions while avoiding overlaps with lesions or existing damaged
regions. In addition, we apply a random projection filter to the pasted
regions, refining local features and ensuring a natural blend with the new
background. Experiments show that our method substantially improves
segmentation performance on the insect damage class, while maintaining or even
slightly enhancing accuracy on other categories. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of targeted augmentation in mitigating extreme pixel imbalance,
offering a straightforward yet effective solution for agricultural segmentation
problems.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The need for long-term multi-object tracking (MOT) is growing due to the
demand for analyzing individual behaviors in videos that span several minutes.
Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking
performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them
difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world
applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain
sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To
address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that
combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals,
our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach
even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21
identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is
robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as
identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM
framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using
both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new
10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at:

Abstract: Event camera sensors are bio-inspired sensors which asynchronously capture
per-pixel brightness changes and output a stream of events encoding the
polarity, location and time of these changes. These systems are witnessing
rapid advancements as an emerging field, driven by their low latency, reduced
power consumption, and ultra-high capture rates. This survey explores the
evolution of fusing event-stream captured with traditional frame-based capture,
highlighting how this synergy significantly benefits various video restoration
and 3D reconstruction tasks. The paper systematically reviews major deep
learning contributions to image/video enhancement and restoration, focusing on
two dimensions: temporal enhancement (such as frame interpolation and motion
deblurring) and spatial enhancement (including super-resolution, low-light and
HDR enhancement, and artifact reduction). This paper also explores how the 3D
reconstruction domain evolves with the advancement of event driven fusion.
Diverse topics are covered, with in-depth discussions on recent works for
improving visual quality under challenging conditions. Additionally, the survey
compiles a comprehensive list of openly available datasets, enabling
reproducible research and benchmarking. By consolidating recent progress and
insights, this survey aims to inspire further research into leveraging event
camera systems, especially in combination with deep learning, for advanced
visual media restoration and enhancement.

Abstract: RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to
leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike
events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks
(ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event
streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking
neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event
perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first
transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped
with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model
employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a
spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To
bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we
systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature
interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory
by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we
incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to
align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent
space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking
benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that
ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy
efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN
designs for robust visual tracking. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Accurate and reliable solar flare predictions are essential to mitigate
potential impacts on critical infrastructure. However, the current performance
of solar flare forecasting is insufficient. In this study, we address the task
of predicting the class of the largest solar flare expected to occur within the
next 72 hours. Existing methods often fail to adequately address the severe
class imbalance across flare classes. To address this issue, we propose a solar
flare prediction model based on multiple deep state space models. In addition,
we introduce the frequency & local-boundary-aware reliability loss (FLARE loss)
to improve predictive performance and reliability under class imbalance.
Experiments were conducted on a multi-wavelength solar image dataset covering a
full 11-year solar activity cycle. As a result, our method outperformed
baseline approaches in terms of both the Gandin-Murphy-Gerrity score and the
true skill statistic, which are standard metrics in terms of the performance
and reliability.

Abstract: RGB-thermal (RGB-T) semantic segmentation improves the environmental
perception of autonomous platforms in challenging conditions. Prevailing models
employ encoders pre-trained on RGB images to extract features from both RGB and
infrared inputs, and design additional modules to achieve cross-modal feature
fusion. This results in limited thermal feature extraction and suboptimal
cross-modal fusion, while the redundant encoders further compromises the
model's real-time efficiency. To address the above issues, we propose TUNI,
with an RGB-T encoder consisting of multiple stacked blocks that simultaneously
perform multi-modal feature extraction and cross-modal fusion. By leveraging
large-scale pre-training with RGB and pseudo-thermal data, the RGB-T encoder
learns to integrate feature extraction and fusion in a unified manner. By
slimming down the thermal branch, the encoder achieves a more compact
architecture. Moreover, we introduce an RGB-T local module to strengthen the
encoder's capacity for cross-modal local feature fusion. The RGB-T local module
employs adaptive cosine similarity to selectively emphasize salient consistent
and distinct local features across RGB-T modalities. Experimental results show
that TUNI achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on FMB,
PST900 and CART, with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. Meanwhile,
it achieves an inference speed of 27 FPS on a Jetson Orin NX, demonstrating its
real-time capability in deployment. Codes are available at

Abstract: Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) is a widely used computer vision method that
determines an agent's movement through a camera and an IMU sensor. This paper
presents an efficient and accurate VIO pipeline optimized for applications on
micro- and nano-UAVs. The proposed design incorporates state-of-the-art feature
detection and tracking methods (SuperPoint, PX4FLOW, ORB), all optimized and
quantized for emerging RISC-V-based ultra-low-power parallel systems on chips
(SoCs). Furthermore, by employing a rigid body motion model, the pipeline
reduces estimation errors and achieves improved accuracy in planar motion
scenarios. The pipeline's suitability for real-time VIO is assessed on an
ultra-low-power SoC in terms of compute requirements and tracking accuracy
after quantization. The pipeline, including the three feature tracking methods,
was implemented on the SoC for real-world validation. This design bridges the
gap between high-accuracy VIO pipelines that are traditionally run on
computationally powerful systems and lightweight implementations suitable for
microcontrollers. The optimized pipeline on the GAP9 low-power SoC demonstrates
an average reduction in RMSE of up to a factor of 3.65x over the baseline
pipeline when using the ORB feature tracker. The analysis of the computational
complexity of the feature trackers further shows that PX4FLOW achieves on-par
tracking accuracy with ORB at a lower runtime for movement speeds below 24
pixels/frame.

Abstract: Recovering 3D face models from 2D in-the-wild images has gained considerable
attention in the computer vision community due to its wide range of potential
applications. However, the lack of ground-truth labeled datasets and the
complexity of real-world environments remain significant challenges. In this
chapter, we propose a convolutional neural network-based approach, the
Hierarchical Multi-Level Attention Network (MLANet), for reconstructing 3D face
models from single in-the-wild images. Our model predicts detailed facial
geometry, texture, pose, and illumination parameters from a single image.
Specifically, we employ a pre-trained hierarchical backbone network and
introduce multi-level attention mechanisms at different stages of 2D face image
feature extraction. A semi-supervised training strategy is employed,
incorporating 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from publicly available
datasets along with a differentiable renderer, enabling an end-to-end training
process. Extensive experiments, including both comparative and ablation
studies, were conducted on two benchmark datasets, AFLW2000-3D and MICC
Florence, focusing on 3D face reconstruction and 3D face alignment tasks. The
effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated both quantitatively and

Abstract: As large vision language models (VLMs) advance, their capabilities in
multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) have significantly improved.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability
and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on
textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning,
constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap,
we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework
with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable
multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box
(BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and
Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an
automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations
through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and
high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT
adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by
verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural
accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets
including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up
to \(\sim\)9.5\% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar
size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by \(\sim\)2.6\%.
Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513
and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our
method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial
deployment. Our code is available at this link:

Abstract: Accurate color alignment in text-to-image (T2I) generation is critical for
applications such as fashion, product visualization, and interior design, yet
current diffusion models struggle with nuanced and compound color terms (e.g.,
Tiffany blue, lime green, hot pink), often producing images that are misaligned
with human intent. Existing approaches rely on cross-attention manipulation,
reference images, or fine-tuning but fail to systematically resolve ambiguous
color descriptions. To precisely render colors under prompt ambiguity, we
propose a training-free framework that enhances color fidelity by leveraging a
large language model (LLM) to disambiguate color-related prompts and guiding
color blending operations directly in the text embedding space. Our method
first employs a large language model (LLM) to resolve ambiguous color terms in
the text prompt, and then refines the text embeddings based on the spatial
relationships of the resulting color terms in the CIELAB color space. Unlike
prior methods, our approach improves color accuracy without requiring
additional training or external reference images. Experimental results
demonstrate that our framework improves color alignment without compromising
image quality, bridging the gap between text semantics and visual generation.

introduce AVI-Math, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate multimodal
mathematical reasoning in aerial vehicle imagery, moving beyond simple counting
tasks to include domain-specific knowledge in areas such as geometry, logic,

captured from UAV views, covering 6 mathematical subjects and 20 topics. The
data, collected at varying altitudes and from multiple UAV angles, reflects
real-world UAV scenarios, ensuring the diversity and complexity of the
constructed mathematical problems. In this paper, we benchmark 14 prominent
VLMs through a comprehensive evaluation and demonstrate that, despite their
success on previous multimodal benchmarks, these models struggle with the
reasoning tasks in AVI-Math. Our detailed analysis highlights significant
limitations in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of current VLMs and
suggests avenues for future research. Furthermore, we explore the use of
Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning techniques, which show promise in
addressing the reasoning challenges in AVI-Math. Our findings not only expose

Abstract: In autonomous driving, trajectory prediction is essential for ensuring safe
and efficient navigation. To improve prediction accuracy, recent approaches
often rely on pre-built high-definition (HD) maps or real-time local map
construction modules to incorporate static environmental information. However,
pre-built HD maps are limited to specific regions and cannot adapt to transient
changes. In addition, local map construction modules, which recognize only
predefined elements, may fail to capture critical scene details or introduce
errors that degrade prediction performance. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Bird's-Eye View Trajectory Prediction (BEVTraj), a novel trajectory
prediction framework that operates directly in the bird's-eye view (BEV) space
utilizing real-time sensor data without relying on any pre-built maps. The
BEVTraj leverages deformable attention to efficiently extract relevant context
from dense BEV features. Furthermore, we introduce a Sparse Goal Candidate
Proposal (SGCP) module, which enables full end-to-end prediction without
requiring any post-processing steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
BEVTraj achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art HD map-based models
while offering greater flexibility by eliminating the dependency on pre-built
maps. The source code is available at https://github.com/Kongminsang/bevtraj.

Abstract: Multi-human parsing is the task of segmenting human body parts while

demonstrate that, while state-of-the-art approaches achieved notable results on
public datasets, they struggle considerably in segmenting people with
overlapping bodies. From the intuition that overlapping people may appear
separated from a different point of view, we propose a novel training framework
exploiting multi-view information to improve multi-human parsing models under
occlusions. Our method integrates such knowledge during the training process,
introducing a novel approach based on weak supervision on human instances and a
multi-view consistency loss. Given the lack of suitable datasets in the
literature, we propose a semi-automatic annotation strategy to generate human
instance segmentation masks from multi-view RGB+D data and 3D human skeletons.
The experiments demonstrate that the approach can achieve up to a 4.20\%
relative improvement on human parsing over the baseline model in occlusion
scenarios.

Abstract: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) plays a critical role in face
recognition and verification systems, especially in uncontrolled, real-world
environments. Although several methods have been proposed, general-purpose
no-reference image quality assessment techniques often fail to capture
face-specific degradations. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art FIQA models tend to be
computationally intensive, limiting their practical applicability. We propose a
lightweight and efficient method for FIQA, designed for the perceptual
evaluation of face images in the wild. Our approach integrates an ensemble of
two compact convolutional neural networks, MobileNetV3-Small and ShuffleNetV2,
with prediction-level fusion via simple averaging. To enhance alignment with
human perceptual judgments, we employ a correlation-aware loss (MSECorrLoss),
combining mean squared error (MSE) with a Pearson correlation regularizer. Our
method achieves a strong balance between accuracy and computational cost,
making it suitable for real-world deployment. Experiments on the VQualA FIQA
benchmark demonstrate that our model achieves a Spearman rank correlation
coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9829 and a Pearson linear correlation coefficient
(PLCC) of 0.9894, remaining within competition efficiency constraints.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models have shown great potential in real-world image
super-resolution (Real-ISR) tasks by enabling high-resolution reconstructions.
While one-step diffusion (OSD) methods significantly improve efficiency
compared to traditional multi-step approaches, they still have limitations in
balancing fidelity and realism across diverse scenarios. Since the OSDs for SR
are usually trained or distilled by a single timestep, they lack flexible
control mechanisms to adaptively prioritize these competing objectives, which
are inherently manageable in multi-step methods through adjusting sampling
steps. To address this challenge, we propose a Realism Controlled One-step
Diffusion (RCOD) framework for Real-ISR. RCOD provides a latent domain grouping
strategy that enables explicit control over fidelity-realism trade-offs during
the noise prediction phase with minimal training paradigm modifications and
original training data. A degradation-aware sampling strategy is also
introduced to align distillation regularization with the grouping strategy and
enhance the controlling of trade-offs. Moreover, a visual prompt injection
module is used to replace conventional text prompts with degradation-aware
visual tokens, enhancing both restoration accuracy and semantic consistency.
Our method achieves superior fidelity and perceptual quality while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCOD
outperforms state-of-the-art OSD methods in both quantitative metrics and
visual qualities, with flexible realism control capabilities in the inference
stage. The code will be released.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the optic disc and cup is critical for the early
diagnosis and management of ocular diseases such as glaucoma. However,
segmentation models trained on one dataset often suffer significant performance
degradation when applied to target data acquired under different imaging
protocols or conditions. To address this challenge, we propose
\textbf{Grad-CL}, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework that
leverages a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data to robustly
adapt segmentation performance without requiring access to the original source
data. Grad-CL combines a gradient-guided pseudolabel refinement module with a
cosine similarity-based contrastive learning strategy. In the first stage,
salient class-specific features are extracted via a gradient-based mechanism,
enabling more accurate uncertainty quantification and robust prototype
estimation for refining noisy pseudolabels. In the second stage, a contrastive
loss based on cosine similarity is employed to explicitly enforce inter-class
separability between the gradient-informed features of the optic cup and disc.
Extensive experiments on challenging cross-domain fundus imaging datasets
demonstrate that Grad-CL outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and
source-free domain adaptation methods, achieving superior segmentation accuracy
and improved boundary delineation. Project and code are available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) is a key component in discrete tokenizers for image
generation, but its training is often unstable due to straight-through
estimation bias, one-step-behind updates, and sparse codebook gradients, which
lead to suboptimal reconstruction performance and low codebook usage. In this
work, we analyze these fundamental challenges and provide a simple yet
effective solution. To maintain high codebook usage in VQ networks (VQN) during
learning annealing and codebook size expansion, we propose VQBridge, a robust,
scalable, and efficient projector based on the map function method. VQBridge
optimizes code vectors through a compress-process-recover pipeline, enabling
stable and effective codebook training. By combining VQBridge with learning
annealing, our VQN achieves full (100%) codebook usage across diverse codebook
configurations, which we refer to as FVQ (FullVQ). Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that FVQ is effective, scalable, and generalizable:
it attains 100% codebook usage even with a 262k-codebook, achieves
state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, consistently improves with larger
codebooks, higher vector channels, or longer training, and remains effective
across different VQ variants. Moreover, when integrated with LlamaGen, FVQ
significantly enhances image generation performance, surpassing visual
autoregressive models (VAR) by 0.5 and diffusion models (DiT) by 0.2 rFID,
highlighting the importance of high-quality tokenizers for strong
autoregressive image generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce LayerLock, a simple yet effective approach for self-supervised
visual representation learning, that gradually transitions from pixel to latent
prediction through progressive layer freezing. First, we make the observation
that during training of video masked-autoencoding (MAE) models, ViT layers
converge in the order of their depth: shallower layers converge early, deeper
layers converge late. We then show that this observation can be exploited to
accelerate standard MAE by progressively freezing the model according to an
explicit schedule, throughout training. Furthermore, this same schedule can be
used in a simple and scalable approach to latent prediction that does not
suffer from "representation collapse". We apply our proposed approach,
LayerLock, to large models of up to 4B parameters with results surpassing those
of non-latent masked prediction on the 4DS perception suite.

Abstract: We present the first systematic comparison of implicit and explicit Novel
View Synthesis methods for space-based 3D object reconstruction, evaluating the
role of appearance embeddings. While embeddings improve photometric fidelity by
modeling lighting variation, we show they do not translate into meaningful
gains in geometric accuracy - a critical requirement for space robotics
applications. Using the SPEED+ dataset, we compare K-Planes, Gaussian
Splatting, and Convex Splatting, and demonstrate that embeddings primarily
reduce the number of primitives needed for explicit methods rather than
enhancing geometric fidelity. Moreover, convex splatting achieves more compact
and clutter-free representations than Gaussian splatting, offering advantages
for safety-critical applications such as interaction and collision avoidance.
Our findings clarify the limits of appearance embeddings for geometry-centric
tasks and highlight trade-offs between reconstruction quality and
representation efficiency in space scenarios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: With generative models becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse,
detecting AI-generated images has become increasingly challenging. While
existing AI-genereted Image detectors achieve promising performance on
in-distribution generated images, their generalization to unseen generative
models remains limited. This limitation is largely attributed to their reliance
on generation-specific artifacts, such as stylistic priors and compression
patterns. To address these limitations, we propose GAMMA, a novel training
framework designed to reduce domain bias and enhance semantic alignment. GAMMA
introduces diverse manipulation strategies, such as inpainting-based
manipulation and semantics-preserving perturbations, to ensure consistency
between manipulated and authentic content. We employ multi-task supervision
with dual segmentation heads and a classification head, enabling pixel-level
source attribution across diverse generative domains. In addition, a reverse
cross-attention mechanism is introduced to allow the segmentation heads to
guide and correct biased representations in the classification branch. Our
method achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on the GenImage
benchmark, imporving accuracy by 5.8%, but also maintains strong robustness on
newly released generative model such as GPT-4o.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fetal brain MRI relies on rapid multi-view 2D slice acquisitions to reduce
motion artifacts caused by fetal movement. However, these stacks are typically
low resolution, may suffer from motion corruption, and do not adequately
capture 3D anatomy. Super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) methods aim to
address these limitations by combining slice-to-volume registration and
super-resolution techniques to generate high-resolution (HR) 3D volumes. While
several SRR methods have been proposed, their comparative performance -
particularly in pathological cases - and their influence on downstream
volumetric analysis and diagnostic tasks remain underexplored. In this study,
we applied three state-of-the-art SRR method - NiftyMIC, SVRTK, and NeSVoR - to
140 fetal brain MRI scans, including both healthy controls (HC) and
pathological cases (PC) with ventriculomegaly (VM). Each HR reconstruction was
segmented using the BoUNTi algorithm to extract volumes of nine principal brain
structures. We evaluated visual quality, SRR success rates, volumetric
measurement agreement, and diagnostic classification performance. NeSVoR
demonstrated the highest and most consistent reconstruction success rate (>90%)
across both HC and PC groups. Although significant differences in volumetric
estimates were observed between SRR methods, classification performance for VM
was not affected by the choice of SRR method. These findings highlight NeSVoR's
robustness and the resilience of diagnostic performance despite SRR-induced
volumetric variability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Object removal, a challenging task within image inpainting, involves
seamlessly filling the removed region with content that matches the surrounding
context. Despite advancements in diffusion models, current methods still face
two critical challenges. The first is mask hallucination, where the model
generates irrelevant or spurious content inside the masked region, and the
second is mask-shape bias, where the model fills the masked area with an object
that mimics the mask's shape rather than surrounding content. To address these
issues, we propose Mask Consistency Regularization (MCR), a novel training
strategy designed specifically for object removal tasks. During training, our
approach introduces two mask perturbations: dilation and reshape, enforcing
consistency between the outputs of these perturbed branches and the original
mask. The dilated masks help align the model's output with the surrounding
content, while reshaped masks encourage the model to break the mask-shape bias.
This combination of strategies enables MCR to produce more robust and
contextually coherent inpainting results. Our experiments demonstrate that MCR
significantly reduces hallucinations and mask-shape bias, leading to improved
performance in object removal.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress in
instruction following and aesthetics. However, a persistent challenge is the
prevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws,
which severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the
diversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained
evaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To
fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for
artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image
artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the
first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with
fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and
corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward
hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward
system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage
MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating
the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench
reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like
GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting
artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development. Project

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) aims to translate natural language from sign
language videos, serving as a vital bridge for inclusive communication. While
recent advances leverage powerful visual backbones and large language models,
most approaches mainly focus on manual signals (hand gestures) and tend to
overlook non-manual cues like mouthing. In fact, mouthing conveys essential
linguistic information in sign languages and plays a crucial role in
disambiguating visually similar signs. In this paper, we propose SignClip, a
novel framework to improve the accuracy of sign language translation. It fuses
manual and non-manual cues, specifically spatial gesture and lip movement
features. Besides, SignClip introduces a hierarchical contrastive learning
framework with multi-level alignment objectives, ensuring semantic consistency
across sign-lip and visual-text modalities. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign, demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. For example, on PHOENIX14T, in the Gloss-free setting, SignClip
surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model SpaMo, improving BLEU-4 from
24.32 to 24.71, and ROUGE from 46.57 to 48.38.

Our results suggest that open-source models are getting closer, but still
behind closed-source ones like GPT- 4o. Additionally, we benchmark image
manipulation detection-specific VLMs for text manipulation detection and show
that they suffer from the generalization problem. We benchmark VLMs for
manipulations done on in-the-wild scene texts and on fantasy ID cards, where
the latter mimic a challenging real-world misuse.

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D (ZS-3D) anomaly detection aims to identify defects in 3D objects
without relying on labeled training data, making it especially valuable in
scenarios constrained by data scarcity, privacy, or high annotation cost.
However, most existing methods focus exclusively on point clouds, neglecting
the rich semantic cues available from complementary modalities such as RGB
images and texts priors. This paper introduces MCL-AD, a novel framework that
leverages multimodal collaboration learning across point clouds, RGB images,
and texts semantics to achieve superior zero-shot 3D anomaly detection.
Specifically, we propose a Multimodal Prompt Learning Mechanism (MPLM) that
enhances the intra-modal representation capability and inter-modal
collaborative learning by introducing an object-agnostic decoupled text prompt
and a multimodal contrastive loss. In addition, a collaborative modulation
mechanism (CMM) is proposed to fully leverage the complementary representations
of point clouds and RGB images by jointly modulating the RGB image-guided and
point cloud-guided branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed MCL-AD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in ZS-3D
anomaly detection.

Abstract: Deep neural networks and Vision Transformers achieve state-of-the-art

method, where drop probabilities increase with depth to control the effective
Lipschitz constant of the network. This approach regularizes deeper layers,
improving robustness while preserving clean accuracy and reducing computation.
Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ViT-Tiny show that our custom depth-dependent
schedule maintains near-baseline clean accuracy, enhances robustness under
FGSM, PGD-20, and AutoAttack, and significantly reduces FLOPs compared to
baseline and linear DropPath schedules.

Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of precise geolocation of street
furniture in complex urban environments, which is a critical task for effective
monitoring and maintenance of public infrastructure by local authorities and
private stakeholders. To this end, we propose a probabilistic framework based
on energy maps that encode the spatial likelihood of object locations.
Representing the energy in a map-based geopositioned format allows the
optimisation process to seamlessly integrate external geospatial information,
such as GIS layers, road maps, or placement constraints, which improves
contextual awareness and localisation accuracy. A stochastic birth-and-death
optimisation algorithm is introduced to infer the most probable configuration
of assets. We evaluate our approach using a realistic simulation informed by a
geolocated dataset of street lighting infrastructure in Dublin city centre,
demonstrating its potential for scalable and accurate urban asset mapping. The

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have gained significant attention in recent years for
their ability to generate high-quality images and videos, yet still suffer from
a huge computational cost due to their iterative denoising process. Recently,
feature caching has been introduced to accelerate diffusion transformers by
caching the feature computation in previous timesteps and reusing it in the
following timesteps, which leverage the temporal similarity of diffusion models
while ignoring the similarity in the spatial dimension. In this paper, we
introduce Cluster-Driven Feature Caching (ClusCa) as an orthogonal and
complementary perspective for previous feature caching. Specifically, ClusCa
performs spatial clustering on tokens in each timestep, computes only one token
in each cluster and propagates their information to all the other tokens, which
is able to reduce the number of tokens by over 90%. Extensive experiments on
DiT, FLUX and HunyuanVideo demonstrate its effectiveness in both text-to-image
and text-to-video generation. Besides, it can be directly applied to any
diffusion transformer without requirements for training. For instance, ClusCa
achieves 4.96x acceleration on FLUX with an ImageReward of 99.49%, surpassing
the original model by 0.51%. The code is available at

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently achieved strong results in semantic
segmentation, yet their deployment on resource-constrained devices remains
limited due to their high memory footprint and computational cost. Quantization
offers an effective strategy to improve efficiency, but ViT-based segmentation
models are notoriously fragile under low precision, as quantization errors
accumulate across deep encoder-decoder pipelines. We introduce I-Segmenter, the
first fully integer-only ViT segmentation framework. Building on the Segmenter
architecture, I-Segmenter systematically replaces floating-point operations
with integer-only counterparts. To further stabilize both training and
inference, we propose $\lambda$-ShiftGELU, a novel activation function that
mitigates the limitations of uniform quantization in handling long-tailed
activation distributions. In addition, we remove the L2 normalization layer and
replace bilinear interpolation in the decoder with nearest neighbor upsampling,
ensuring integer-only execution throughout the computational graph. Extensive
experiments show that I-Segmenter achieves accuracy within a reasonable margin
of its FP32 baseline (5.1 % on average), while reducing model size by up to
3.8x and enabling up to 1.2x faster inference with optimized runtimes. Notably,
even in one-shot PTQ with a single calibration image, I-Segmenter delivers
competitive accuracy, underscoring its practicality for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a vital imaging modality for diagnosing
and monitoring retinal diseases. However, OCT images are inherently degraded by
speckle noise, which obscures fine details and hinders accurate interpretation.
While numerous denoising methods exist, many struggle to balance noise
reduction with the preservation of crucial anatomical structures. This paper
introduces GARD (Gamma-based Anatomical Restoration and Denoising), a novel
deep learning approach for OCT image despeckling that leverages the strengths
of diffusion probabilistic models. Unlike conventional diffusion models that
assume Gaussian noise, GARD employs a Denoising Diffusion Gamma Model to more
accurately reflect the statistical properties of speckle. Furthermore, we
introduce a Noise-Reduced Fidelity Term that utilizes a pre-processed,
less-noisy image to guide the denoising process. This crucial addition prevents
the reintroduction of high-frequency noise. We accelerate the inference process
by adapting the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model framework to our Gamma-based
model. Experiments on a dataset with paired noisy and less-noisy OCT B-scans
demonstrate that GARD significantly outperforms traditional denoising methods
and state-of-the-art deep learning models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and MSE.
Qualitative results confirm that GARD produces sharper edges and better
preserves fine anatomical details.

Abstract: Mammography screening is an essential tool for early detection of breast
cancer. The speed and accuracy of mammography interpretation have the potential
to be improved with deep learning methods. However, the development of a
foundation visual language model (VLM) is hindered by limited data and domain
differences between natural and medical images. Existing mammography VLMs,
adapted from natural images, often ignore domain-specific characteristics, such
as multi-view relationships in mammography. Unlike radiologists who analyze
both views together to process ipsilateral correspondence, current methods
treat them as independent images or do not properly model the multi-view
correspondence learning, losing critical geometric context and resulting in
suboptimal prediction. We propose GLAM: Global and Local Alignment for
Multi-view mammography for VLM pretraining using geometry guidance. By
leveraging the prior knowledge about the multi-view imaging process of
mammograms, our model learns local cross-view alignments and fine-grained local
features through joint global and local, visual-visual, and visual-language
contrastive learning. Pretrained on EMBED [14], one of the largest open
mammography datasets, our model outperforms baselines across multiple datasets
under different settings.

applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded
multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among
visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally,
we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising

Abstract: Recent advances in text-based image editing have enabled fine-grained
manipulation of visual content guided by natural language. However, such
methods are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a
novel attack that targets the visual component of editing methods. We introduce
Attention Attack, which disrupts the cross-attention between a textual prompt
and the visual representation of the image by using an automatically generated
caption of the source image as a proxy for the edit prompt. This breaks the
alignment between the contents of the image and their textual description,
without requiring knowledge of the editing method or the editing prompt.
Reflecting on the reliability of existing metrics for immunization success, we
propose two novel evaluation strategies: Caption Similarity, which quantifies
semantic consistency between original and adversarial edits, and semantic
Intersection over Union (IoU), which measures spatial layout disruption via
segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on the TEDBench++ benchmark
demonstrate that our attack significantly degrades editing performance while
remaining imperceptible.

Abstract: Learned image compression sits at the intersection of machine learning and
image processing. With advances in deep learning, neural network-based
compression methods have emerged. In this process, an encoder maps the image to
a low-dimensional latent space, which is then quantized, entropy-coded into a
binary bitstream, and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver end, the
bitstream is entropy-decoded, and a decoder reconstructs an approximation of
the original image. Recent research suggests that these models consistently
outperform conventional codecs. However, they require significant processing
power, making them unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained
platforms, which hinders their deployment in mainstream applications. This
study aims to reduce the resource requirements of neural networks used for
image compression by leveraging knowledge distillation, a training paradigm
where smaller neural networks, partially trained on the outputs of larger, more
complex models, can achieve better performance than when trained independently.
Our work demonstrates that knowledge distillation can be effectively applied to
image compression tasks: i) across various architecture sizes, ii) to achieve
different image quality/bit rate tradeoffs, and iii) to save processing and
energy resources. This approach introduces new settings and hyperparameters,
and future research could explore the impact of different teacher models, as
well as alternative loss functions. Knowledge distillation could also be
extended to transformer-based models. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Decomposing an image into its intrinsic photometric factors--shading and
reflectance--is a long-standing challenge due to the lack of extensive
ground-truth data for real-world scenes. Recent methods rely on synthetic data
or sparse annotations for limited indoor and even fewer outdoor scenes. We
introduce a novel training-free approach for intrinsic image decomposition
using only a pair of visible and thermal images. We leverage the principle that
light not reflected from an opaque surface is absorbed and detected as heat by
a thermal camera. This allows us to relate the ordinalities between visible and
thermal image intensities to the ordinalities of shading and reflectance, which
can densely self-supervise an optimizing neural network to recover shading and
reflectance. We perform quantitative evaluations with known reflectance and
shading under natural and artificial lighting, and qualitative experiments
across diverse outdoor scenes. The results demonstrate superior performance
over recent learning-based models and point toward a scalable path to curating
real-world ordinal supervision, previously infeasible via manual labeling.

Abstract: Compressed video quality enhancement (CVQE) is crucial for improving user
experience with lossy video codecs like H.264/AVC, H.265/HEVC, and H.266/VVC.
While deep learning based CVQE has driven significant progress, existing

linking methods to specific standards and artifacts, insufficient comparative
analysis of architectural paradigms across coding types, and underdeveloped
benchmarking practices. To address these gaps, this paper presents three key

across architectural paradigms, coding standards, and compressed-domain feature
utilization. Second, it proposes a unified benchmarking framework integrating
modern compression protocols and standard test sequences for fair
multi-criteria evaluation. Third, it provides a systematic analysis of the
critical trade-offs between reconstruction performance and computational
complexity observed in state-of-the-art methods and highlighting promising
directions for future research. This comprehensive review aims to establish a
foundation for consistent assessment and informed model selection in CVQE
research and deployment.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation, a key task in computer vision with broad applications
in autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics, has advanced
substantially with deep learning. Nevertheless, current approaches remain
vulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and
adverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that
integrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged,
providing complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we
present MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed
method employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into
SAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong
generalization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating
auxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM
SAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We
evaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES,
where MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze
modality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard
subsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms
competing methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the
effectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding. The code

Abstract: Arbitrary resolution image generation provides a consistent visual experience
across devices, having extensive applications for producers and consumers.
Current diffusion models increase computational demand quadratically with
resolution, causing 4K image generation delays over 100 seconds. To solve this,
we explore the second generation upon the latent diffusion models, where the
fixed latent generated by diffusion models is regarded as the content
representation and we propose to decode arbitrary resolution images with a
compact generated latent using a one-step generator. Thus, we present the
\textbf{InfGen}, replacing the VAE decoder with the new generator, for
generating images at any resolution from a fixed-size latent without retraining
the diffusion models, which simplifies the process, reducing computational
complexity and can be applied to any model using the same latent space.
Experiments show InfGen is capable of improving many models into the arbitrary
high-resolution era while cutting 4K image generation time to under 10 seconds.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that causes
memory loss and cognitive decline. While there has been extensive research in
applying deep learning models to Alzheimer's prediction tasks, these models
remain limited by lack of available labeled data, poor generalization across
datasets, and inflexibility to varying numbers of input scans and time
intervals between scans. In this study, we adapt three state-of-the-art
temporal self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches for 3D brain MRI analysis,
and add novel extensions designed to handle variable-length inputs and learn
robust spatial features. We aggregate four publicly available datasets
comprising 3,161 patients for pre-training, and show the performance of our
model across multiple Alzheimer's prediction tasks including diagnosis
classification, conversion detection, and future conversion prediction.
Importantly, our SSL model implemented with temporal order prediction and
contrastive learning outperforms supervised learning on six out of seven
downstream tasks. It demonstrates adaptability and generalizability across
tasks and number of input images with varying time intervals, highlighting its
capacity for robust performance across clinical applications. We release our
code and model publicly at https://github.com/emilykaczmarek/SSL-AD.

Existing methods tend to\ngenerate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images\nlacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nFSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID\nrestoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.\nOur approach involves three key designs: 1) \\textbf{Masking} the facial region\nin the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)\n\\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style\nguidance; 3) Leveraging \\textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)\nimages for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation.

While current VQA benchmarks\nconsider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically\nblend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of\nreasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic\nevaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning\nlevels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by\nprior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this\nbenchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object\nproperties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based\nquestions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings\nreveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing\nmodel only reaching 40\\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic\n(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional\nproperties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for\nscalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional\nreasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available\nto support such endeavors."}

To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful\ngenerative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable\nimage classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by\nrandomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising\neffects with different category conditions to classify categories.\nUnfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise\ninstability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance\nchanges. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always\nensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces\nthe classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in\nDC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the\ninstability.

Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)\nto mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based\ndetection models.

Surprisingly, we find that removing or\nmodifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of\ntemporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while\npreserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this\nbehavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal\ninformation is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information\npathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame\nattention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the\nquery tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges\nfrom inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,\nwhich implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we\npropose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a\ntemporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal\nunderstanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement."}

We developed an end-to-end pipeline that\ncombines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric\ntriangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from\nstreet-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first\nestimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a\ngradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly\nfor distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive\nperformance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly\nreducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using\nGPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole\ncamera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera\nplacement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the\nhighest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute\nerror (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To\nthe best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth\nmodeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural\nassessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video\ndata.

In\nthis paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To\nachieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs\nand demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method\ninvolves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide\nthe MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to\nindependently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's\noutput. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference\nprocess in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of\neach reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off\nobject precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving\ncontrol over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to\ncontrol the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of\nvisual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination\nbenchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM\ninference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation\nmethods."}

However, existing approaches struggle\nto effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended\nsettings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in\nadvance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for\nmulti-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is\nmotivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains\nproduce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when\noperating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base\nmodel than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two\nobservations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,\nwhich nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method\noperates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing\ncosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base\nmodel. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight\nmatrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain\ndrift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that\nincorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We\nextend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling\ninference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in\nClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises\neffectively to multiple latent diffusion models."}

In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this\ndirection by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for\nenabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by\nautonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and\ncomputational operations via executable code. This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually\ncollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the\nlearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies\ndistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning\nexploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental\nanalysis and ablation studies.

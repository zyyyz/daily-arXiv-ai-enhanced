Existing Text-to-Image (T2I) models often produce outputs that are visually plausible yet scientifically incorrect, resulting in a persistent visual-logic divergence that limits their value for downstream reasoning. Motivated by recent advances in next-generation T2I models, we conduct a systematic study of scientific image synthesis across generation paradigms, evaluation, and downstream use. We analyze both direct pixel-based generation and programmatic synthesis, and propose ImgCoder, a logic-driven framework that follows an explicit \"understand - plan - code\" workflow to improve structural precision. To rigorously assess scientific correctness, we introduce SciGenBench, which evaluates generated images based on information utility and logical validity. Our evaluation reveals systematic failure modes in pixel-based models and highlights a fundamental expressiveness-precision trade-off. Finally, we show that fine-tuning Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on rigorously verified synthetic scientific images yields consistent reasoning gains, with potential scaling trends analogous to the text domain, validating high-fidelity scientific synthesis as a viable path to unlocking massive multimodal reasoning capabilities."}

Accurate segmentation, particularly for complex pathologies like meningiomas, demands that models fully exploit the latent information within limited high-quality annotations. To maximize the value of existing datasets, we propose a novel dual-augmentation framework that synergistically integrates spatial manifold expansion and semantic object injection. Specifically, we leverage Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model continuous velocity fields. Unlike previous methods, we perform linear mixing on the integrated deformation fields, enabling the efficient generation of anatomically plausible variations by interpolating within the deformation space. This approach allows for the extensive exploration of structural diversity from a small set of anchors. Furthermore, we introduce a Sim2Real lesion injection module. This module constructs a high-fidelity simulation domain by transplanting lesion textures into healthy anatomical backgrounds, effectively bridging the gap between synthetic augmentation and real-world pathology. Comprehensive experiments on a hybrid dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the data efficiency and robustness of state-of-the-art models, including nnU-Net and U-Mamba, offering a potent strategy for high-performance medical image analysis with limited annotation budgets."}

Monitoring patients with these diseases involves the observation of peripheral blood samples under a microscope, a time-consuming procedure. Moreover, a specialist is required to perform this technique, and owing to the subjective nature of the observation of isolated RBCs, the error rate is high. In this paper, we propose an automated method for differentially enumerating RBCs that uses peripheral blood smear image analysis. In this method, the objects of interest in the image are segmented using a Chan-Vese active contour model. An analysis is then performed to classify the RBCs, also called erythrocytes, as normal or elongated or having other deformations, using the basic shape analysis descriptors: circular shape factor (CSF) and elliptical shape factor (ESF). To analyze cells that become partially occluded in a cluster during sample preparation, an elliptical adjustment is performed to allow the analysis of erythrocytes with discoidal and elongated shapes. The images of patient blood samples used in the study were acquired by a clinical laboratory specialist in the Special Hematology Department of the ``Dr. Juan Bruno Zayas'' General Hospital in Santiago de Cuba. A comparison of the results obtained by the proposed method in our experiments with those obtained by some state-of-the-art methods showed that the proposed method is superior for the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia. This superiority is achieved for evidenced by the obtained F-measure value (0.97 for normal cells and 0.95 for elongated ones) and several overall multiclass performance measures. The results achieved by the proposed method are suitable for the purpose of clinical treatment and diagnostic support of sickle cell anemia."}

Despite rapid growth in machine learning, vision language models (VLMs) still fail to understand or generate basic visual concepts such as object orientation, quantity, or spatial relationships, which highlighted gaps in elementary visual reasoning. By adapting MMVP benchmark questions into explicit and implicit prompts, we create \\textit{AMVICC}, a novel benchmark for profiling failure modes across various modalities. After testing 11 MLLMs and 3 IGMs in nine categories of visual reasoning, our results show that failure modes are often shared between models and modalities, but certain failures are model-specific and modality-specific, and this can potentially be attributed to various factors. IGMs consistently struggled to manipulate specific visual components in response to prompts, especially in explicit prompts, suggesting poor control over fine-grained visual attributes. Our findings apply most directly to the evaluation of existing state-of-the-art models on structured visual reasoning tasks. This work lays the foundation for future cross-modal alignment studies, offering a framework to probe whether generation and interpretation failures stem from shared limitations to guide future improvements in unified vision-language modeling."}

To address these challenges, we introduce MANGO, a large-scale global dataset comprising 42,703 labeled image-mask pairs across 124 countries. To construct this dataset, we retrieve all available Sentinel-2 imagery within the year 2020 for mangrove regions and select the best single-date observations that align with the mangrove annual mask. This selection is performed using a target detection-driven approach that leverages pixel-wise coordinate references to ensure adaptive and representative image-mask pairings. We also provide a benchmark across diverse semantic segmentation architectures under a country-disjoint split, establishing a foundation for scalable and reliable global mangrove monitoring."}

This research paper aims to investigate the potential of a multimodal approach that combines Leap Motion and RGB camera data to explore the feasibility of recognition of ArSL. The system architecture includes two parallel subnetworks: a custom dense neural network for Leap Motion data, incorporating dropout and L2 regularization, and an image subnetwork based on a fine-tuned VGG16 model enhanced with data augmentation techniques. Feature representations from both modalities are concatenated in a fusion model and passed through fully connected layers, with final classification performed via SoftMax activation to analyze spatial and temporal features of hand gestures. The system was evaluated on a custom dataset comprising 18 ArSL words, of which 13 were correctly recognized, yielding an overall accuracy of 78%.

However, in existing designs, tight coupling between \"membership matrix\" and \"subspace matrix U\" in MCR2 causes redundant coding under incorrect token projection. To this end, we decouple the functional relationship between the \"membership matrix\" and \"subspaces U\" in the MCR2 objective and derive an interpretable sparse linear attention operator from unrolled gradient descent of the optimized objective. Specifically, we propose to directly learn the membership matrix from inputs and subsequently derive sparse subspaces from the fullspace S. Consequently, gradient unrolling of the optimized MCR2 objective yields an interpretable sparse linear attention operator: Decoupled Membership-Subspace Attention (DMSA). Experimental results on visual tasks show that simply replacing the attention module in Token Statistics Transformer (ToST) with DMSA (we refer to as DMST) not only achieves a faster coding reduction rate but also outperforms ToST by 1.08%-1.45% in top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset.

Current paradigms struggle to disentangle these factors without massive supervised datasets, often reducing noise to mere interference rather than an information resource. Here, we introduce \"Noisomics\", a framework shifting the focus from suppression to systematic noise decoding via the Contrastive Pre-trained (CoP) Foundation Model. By leveraging the manifold hypothesis and synthetic noise genome, CoP employs contrastive learning to disentangle semantic signals from stochastic perturbations. Crucially, CoP breaks traditional deep learning scaling laws, achieving superior performance with only 100 training samples, outperforming supervised baselines trained on 100,000 samples, thereby reducing data and computational dependency by three orders of magnitude. Extensive benchmarking across 12 diverse out-of-domain datasets confirms its robust zero-shot generalization, demonstrating a 63.8% reduction in estimation error and an 85.1% improvement in the coefficient of determination compared to the conventional training strategy. We demonstrate CoP's utility across scales: from deciphering non-linear hardware-noise interplay in consumer photography to optimizing photon-efficient protocols for deep-tissue microscopy. By decoding noise as a multi-parametric footprint, our work redefines stochastic degradation as a vital information resource, empowering precise imaging diagnostics without prior device calibration."}

However, these critical events frequently occur in privacy-sensitive environments like restrooms, and changing rooms, where conventional surveillance is prohibited or severely restricted by stringent privacy regulations and ethical concerns. Here, we propose the Single-Pixel Vision-Language Model (SP-VLM), a novel framework that reimagines secure environmental monitoring. It achieves intrinsic privacy-by-design by capturing human dynamics through inherently low-dimensional single-pixel modalities and inferring complex behavioral patterns via seamless vision-language integration. Building on this framework, we demonstrate that single-pixel sensing intrinsically suppresses identity recoverability, rendering state-of-the-art face recognition systems ineffective below a critical sampling rate. We further show that SP-VLM can nonetheless extract meaningful behavioral semantics, enabling robust anomaly detection, people counting, and activity understanding from severely degraded single-pixel observations. Combining these findings, we identify a practical sampling-rate regime in which behavioral intelligence emerges while personal identity remains strongly protected. Together, these results point to a human-rights-aligned pathway for safety monitoring that can support timely intervention without normalizing intrusive surveillance in privacy-sensitive spaces."}

However, it is rarely quantified in clinical practice. Existing continuous monitoring systems with commercially available wearable activity trackers are typically developed in middle-aged adults and therefore perform unreliably in older adults with slower and more variable gait patterns. This study aimed to develop a robust human activity recognition (HAR) system to improve continuous physical activity recognition in the context of hip fracture rehabilitation. 24 healthy older adults aged over 80 years were included to perform activities of daily living (walking, standing, sitting, lying down, and postural transfers) under simulated free-living conditions for 75 minutes while wearing two accelerometers positioned on the lower back and anterior upper thigh. Model robustness was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The synthetic data demonstrated potential to improve generalization across participants. The resulting feature intervention model (FIM), aided by synthetic data guidance, achieved reliable activity recognition with mean F1-scores of 0.896 for walking, 0.927 for standing, 0.997 for sitting, 0.937 for lying down, and 0.816 for postural transfers. Compared with a control condition model without synthetic data, the FIM significantly improved the postural transfer detection, i.e., an activity class of high clinical relevance that is often overlooked in existing HAR literature. In conclusion, these preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of robust activity recognition in older adults. Further validation in hip fracture patient populations is required to assess the clinical utility of the proposed monitoring system."}

Existing benchmarks for egocentric domain generalization often conflate covariate shifts with concept shifts, making it difficult to reliably evaluate a model's ability to generalize across input distributions. To address this limitation, we introduce Ego4OOD, a domain generalization benchmark derived from Ego4D that emphasizes measurable covariate diversity while reducing concept shift through semantically coherent, moment-level action categories. Ego4OOD spans eight geographically distinct domains and is accompanied by a clustering-based covariate shift metric that provides a quantitative proxy for domain difficulty. We further leverage a one-vs-all binary training objective that decomposes multi-class action recognition into independent binary classification tasks. This formulation is particularly well-suited for covariate shift by reducing interference between visually similar classes under feature distribution shift. Using this formulation, we show that a lightweight two-layer fully connected network achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art egocentric domain generalization methods on both Argo1M and Ego4OOD, despite using fewer parameters and no additional modalities. Our empirical analysis demonstrates a clear relationship between measured covariate shift and recognition performance, highlighting the importance of controlled benchmarks and quantitative domain characterization for studying out-of-distribution generalization in egocentric video."}

Our approach combines YOLOv8 for accurate small-object detection with Intersection over Union (IoU) analysis to differentiate bullet holes across sequential images. To address the scarcity of labeled sequential data, we propose a novel data augmentation technique that removes rather than adds objects to simulate realistic firing sequences.

We categorize state construction into implicit paradigms (context management) and explicit paradigms (latent compression), while dynamics modeling is analyzed through knowledge integration and architectural reformulation. Furthermore, we advocate for a transition in evaluation from visual fidelity to functional benchmarks, testing physical persistence and causal reasoning. We conclude by identifying two critical frontiers: enhancing persistence via data-driven memory and compressed fidelity, and advancing causality through latent factor decoupling and reasoning-prior integration.

However, directly applying existing fine-tuning methods to remote sensing (RS) images often leads to issues such as overfitting on background noise or neglecting target details. This is primarily due to the large-scale variations, sparse target distributions, and complex regional semantic features inherent in RS images. These challenges limit the effectiveness of MLLMs in RS tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy called Guided Region-Aware Sparse Prompting (GRASP). GRASP introduces spatially structured soft prompts associated with spatial blocks extracted from a frozen visual token grid. Through a question-guided sparse fusion mechanism, GRASP dynamically aggregates task-specific context into a compact global prompt, enabling the model to focus on relevant regions while filtering out background noise. Extensive experiments on multiple RSVQA benchmarks show that GRASP achieves competitive performance compared to existing fine-tuning and prompt-based methods while maintaining high parameter efficiency."}

However, traditional LoD modeling processes rely on manual operations that are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to geometric inconsistencies. While the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new possibilities for generating multi-level architectural models from sketch inputs, its application remains limited by the lack of high-quality paired LoD training data. To address this issue, we propose an automatic LoD sketch extraction framework using generative AI models, which progressively simplifies high-detail architectural models to automatically generate geometrically consistent and hierarchically coherent multi-LoD representations. The proposed framework integrates computer vision techniques with generative AI methods to establish a progressive extraction pipeline that transitions from detailed representations to volumetric abstractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the method maintains strong geometric consistency across LoD levels, achieving SSIM values of 0.7319 and 0.7532 for the transitions from LoD3 to LoD2 and from LoD2 to LoD1, respectively, with corresponding normalized Hausdorff distances of 25.1% and 61.0% of the image diagonal, reflecting controlled geometric deviation during abstraction. These results verify that the proposed framework effectively preserves global structure while achieving progressive semantic simplification across different LoD levels, providing reliable data and technical support for AI-driven multi-level architectural generation and hierarchical modeling."}

Confidence intervals (CIs) play a central role in this process by indicating how precise a reported performance estimate is. Yet, due to the limited amount of work examining CI behavior in medical imaging, the community remains largely unaware of how many diverse CI methods exist and how they behave in specific settings. The purpose of this study is to close this gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical analysis across a total of 24 segmentation and classification tasks, using 19 trained models per task group, a broad spectrum of commonly used performance metrics, multiple aggregation strategies, and several widely adopted CI methods. Reliability (coverage) and precision (width) of each CI method were estimated across all settings to characterize their dependence on study characteristics. Our analysis revealed five principal findings: 1) the sample size required for reliable CIs varies from a few dozens to several thousands of cases depending on study parameters; 2) CI behavior is strongly affected by the choice of performance metric; 3) aggregation strategy substantially influences the reliability of CIs, e.g. they require more observations for macro than for micro; 4) the machine learning problem (segmentation versus classification) modulates these effects; 5) different CI methods are not equally reliable and precise depending on the use case.

Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP) 2026", "summary": "Annotating medical data for training AI models is often costly and limited due to the shortage of specialists with relevant clinical expertise. This challenge is further compounded by privacy and ethical concerns associated with sensitive patient information. As a result, well-trained medical segmentation models on private datasets constitute valuable intellectual property requiring robust protection mechanisms. Existing model protection techniques primarily focus on classification and generative tasks, while segmentation models-crucial to medical image analysis-remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel, stealthy, and harmless method, StealthMark, for verifying the ownership of medical segmentation models under black-box conditions. Our approach subtly modulates model uncertainty without altering the final segmentation outputs, thereby preserving the model's performance. To enable ownership verification, we incorporate model-agnostic explanation methods, e.g. LIME, to extract feature attributions from the model outputs. Under specific triggering conditions, these explanations reveal a distinct and verifiable watermark. We further design the watermark as a QR code to facilitate robust and recognizable ownership claims. We conducted extensive experiments across four medical imaging datasets and five mainstream segmentation models. The results demonstrate the effectiveness, stealthiness, and harmlessness of our method on the original model's segmentation performance. For example, when applied to the SAM model, StealthMark consistently achieved ASR above 95% across various datasets while maintaining less than a 1% drop in Dice and AUC scores, significantly outperforming backdoor-based watermarking methods and highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment.

This divide, rooted in the distinction between VQ-VAEs and VAEs, hinders unified modeling and fair benchmarking. Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) offers a theoretical bridge, yet vanilla FSQ suffers from a critical flaw: its equal-interval quantization can cause activation collapse. This mismatch forces a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and information efficiency. In this work, we resolve this dilemma by simply replacing the activation function in original FSQ with a distribution-matching mapping to enforce a uniform prior. Termed iFSQ, this simple strategy requires just one line of code yet mathematically guarantees both optimal bin utilization and reconstruction precision. Leveraging iFSQ as a controlled benchmark, we uncover two key insights: (1) The optimal equilibrium between discrete and continuous representations lies at approximately 4 bits per dimension. (2) Under identical reconstruction constraints, AR models exhibit rapid initial convergence, whereas diffusion models achieve a superior performance ceiling, suggesting that strict sequential ordering may limit the upper bounds of generation quality. Finally, we extend our analysis by adapting Representation Alignment (REPA) to AR models, yielding LlamaGen-REPA. Codes is available at https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/iFSQ"}

Yet in civil and built-environment research, there is no consistent and privacy-preserving way to represent and measure socially meaningful interaction in these spaces, leaving studies to operationalize \"interaction\" differently across contexts and limiting practitioners' ability to evaluate whether design interventions are changing the forms of interaction that social capital theory predicts should matter. To address this field-level and methodological gap, we introduce the Dyadic User Engagement DataseT (DUET) dataset and an embedded kinesics recognition framework that operationalize Ekman and Friesen's kinesics taxonomy as a function-level interaction vocabulary aligned with social capital-relevant behaviors (e.g., reciprocity and attention coordination). DUET captures 12 dyadic interactions spanning all five kinesic functions-emblems, illustrators, affect displays, adaptors, and regulators-across four sensing modalities and three built-environment contexts, enabling privacy-preserving analysis of communicative intent through movement. Benchmarking six open-source, state-of-the-art human activity recognition models quantifies the difficulty of communicative-function recognition on DUET and highlights the limitations of ubiquitous monadic, action-level recognition when extended to dyadic, socially grounded interaction measurement. Building on DUET, our recognition framework infers communicative function directly from privacy-preserving skeletal motion without handcrafted action-to-function dictionaries; using a transfer-learning architecture, it reveals structured clustering of kinesic functions and a strong association between representation quality and classification performance while generalizing across subjects and contexts."}

Conventional approaches rely on transmitting raw video or high-dimensional sensory data from roadside units (RSUs) to vehicles, which is impractical under vehicular communication bandwidth and latency constraints.

To evaluate the system, we construct a digital twin of an urban traffic environment enabling the generation of d verse traffic scenarios with both safe and collision events. These embeddings of the future frame, extracted from V-JEPA, capture task-relevant traffic dynamics and are transmitted via V2X links to vehicles, where a lightweight attentive probe and classifier decode them to predict imminent collisions. By transmitting only semantic embeddings instead of raw frames, the proposed system significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework with an appropriate processing method achieves a 10% F1-score improvement for collision prediction while reducing transmission requirements by four orders of magnitude compared to raw video. This validates the potential of semantic V2X communication to enable cooperative, real-time collision prediction in ITS."}

Existing approaches either fail to leverage unlabeled data from the target domain or rely on image-to-image translation, which can distort tissue structures and compromise model accuracy. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) framework that utilizes a latent diffusion model trained on unlabeled data from both the source and target domains to generate morphology-preserving and target-aware synthetic images. By conditioning the diffusion model on foundation model features, cohort identity, and tissue preparation method, we preserve tissue structure in the source domain while introducing target-domain appearance characteristics. The target-aware synthetic images, combined with real, labeled images from the source cohort, are subsequently used to train a downstream classifier, which is then tested on the target cohort. The effectiveness of the proposed SSDA framework is demonstrated on the task of lung adenocarcinoma prognostication. The proposed augmentation yielded substantially better performance on the held-out test set from the target cohort, without degrading source-cohort performance. The approach improved the weighted F1 score on the target-cohort held-out test set from 0.611 to 0.706 and the macro F1 score from 0.641 to 0.716. Our results demonstrate that target-aware diffusion-based synthetic data augmentation provides a promising and effective approach for improving domain generalization in computational pathology."}

The first fails to capture the rich, free-form, and visually grounded nature of LVLM responses, while the latter focuses on assessing language quality over factual relevance, often resulting in subjective judgments that are misaligned with human perception. In this work, we address this issue by proposing FineVAU, a new benchmark for VAU that shifts the focus towards rich, fine-grained and domain-specific understanding of anomalous videos. We formulate VAU as a three-fold problem, with the goal of comprehensively understanding key descriptive elements of anomalies in video: events (What), participating entities (Who) and location (Where).

Human evaluation reveals that our proposed metric has a superior alignment with human perception of anomalies in comparison to current approaches. Detailed experiments on FineVAU unveil critical limitations in LVLM's ability to perceive anomalous events that require spatial and fine-grained temporal understanding, despite strong performance on coarse grain, static information, and events with strong visual cues."}

To bridge this gap, we propose Fluxamba, a lightweight architecture that introduces a topology-aware feature rectification framework. Central to our design is the Structural Flux Block (SFB), which orchestrates an anisotropic information flux by integrating an Anisotropic Structural Gate (ASG) with a Prior-Modulated Flow (PMF). This mechanism decouples feature orientation from spatial location, dynamically gating context aggregation along the target's intrinsic geometry rather than rigid paths. Furthermore, to mitigate serialization-induced noise in low-contrast environments, we incorporate a Hierarchical Spatial Regulator (HSR) for multi-scale semantic alignment and a High-Fidelity Focus Unit (HFFU) to explicitly maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of faint features. Extensive experiments on diverse geological benchmarks (LROC-Lineament, LineaMapper, and GeoCrack) demonstrate that Fluxamba establishes a new state-of-the-art. Notably, on the challenging LROC-Lineament dataset, it achieves an F1-score of 89.22% and mIoU of 89.87%.

In sequential letter presentation, the afterimage of one symbol can interfere with perception of the next, leading to systematic recognition errors. Rather than relying on future hardware improvements, we investigate whether optimizing the visual symbols themselves can mitigate this temporal interference. We present SymbolSight, a computational framework that selects symbol-to-letter mappings to minimize confusion among frequently adjacent letters. Using simulated prosthetic vision (SPV) and a neural proxy observer, we estimate pairwise symbol confusability and optimize assignments using language-specific bigram statistics. Across simulations in Arabic, Bulgarian, and English, the resulting heterogeneous symbol sets reduced predicted confusion by a median factor of 22 relative to native alphabets. These results suggest that standard typography is poorly matched to serial, low-bandwidth prosthetic vision and demonstrate how computational modeling can efficiently narrow the design space of visual encodings to generate high-potential candidates for future psychophysical and clinical evaluation."}

While convolutional neural network-, Transformer-, and Mamba-based U-Net variants have achieved strong performance, they still struggle to capture geometric and structural cues, especially in low-contrast or cluttered colonoscopy scenes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Geometric Prior-guided Module (GPM) that injects explicit geometric priors into U-Net-based architectures for polyp segmentation. Specifically, we fine-tune the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) on a simulated ColonDepth dataset to estimate depth maps of polyp images tailored to the endoscopic domain. These depth maps are then processed by GPM to encode geometric priors into the encoder's feature maps, where they are further refined using spatial and channel attention mechanisms that emphasize both local spatial and global channel information. GPM is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly integrated into diverse U-Net variants. Extensive experiments on five public polyp segmentation datasets demonstrate consistent gains over three strong baselines.

To address this gap, we perform a frequency-domain analysis that confirms the superiority of the YUV color space for L3IE.

This study presents HyDeMiC (Hyperspectral Deep Learning-based Mineral Classifier), a convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed for robust mineral classification under noisy data. To train HyDeMiC, laboratory-measured hyperspectral data for 115 minerals spanning various mineral groups were used from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) library. The training dataset was generated by convolving reference mineral spectra with an HSI sensor response function. These datasets contained three copper-bearing minerals, Cuprite, Malachite, and Chalcopyrite, used as case studies for performance demonstration. The trained CNN model was evaluated on several synthetic 2D hyperspectral datasets with noise levels of 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10%. Our noisy data analysis aims to replicate realistic field conditions. The HyDeMiC's performance was assessed using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), providing a comprehensive measure across different noise regimes. Results demonstrate that HyDeMiC achieved near-perfect classification accuracy (MCC = 1.00) on clean and low-noise datasets and maintained strong performance under moderate noise conditions.

We present PocketGS, a mobile scene modeling paradigm that enables on-device 3DGS training under these tightly coupled constraints while preserving high perceptual fidelity. Our method resolves the fundamental contradictions of standard 3DGS through three co-designed operators: G builds geometry-faithful point-cloud priors; I injects local surface statistics to seed anisotropic Gaussians, thereby reducing early conditioning gaps; and T unrolls alpha compositing with cached intermediates and index-mapped gradient scattering for stable mobile backpropagation.

Although existing deep learning-based watermarking systems can hide watermarks in images with minimal impact on image quality, they often lack robustness when encountering image corruptions during transmission, which undermines their practical application value. To this end, we propose a high-quality and robust watermark framework based on the diffusion model. Our method first converts the clean image into inversion noise through a null-text optimization process, and after optimizing the inversion noise in the latent space, it produces a high-quality watermarked image through an iterative denoising process of the diffusion model. The iterative denoising process serves as a powerful purification mechanism, ensuring both the visual quality of the watermarked image and enhancing the robustness of the watermark against various corruptions. To prevent the optimizing of inversion noise from distorting the original semantics of the image, we specifically introduced self-attention constraints and pseudo-mask strategies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method against various image corruptions.

We introduce CoT-Seg, a training-free framework that rethinks reasoning segmentation by combining chain-of-thought reasoning with self-correction. Instead of fine-tuning, CoT-Seg leverages the inherent reasoning ability of pre-trained MLLMs (GPT-4o) to decompose queries into meta-instructions, extract fine-grained semantics from images, and identify target objects even under implicit or complex prompts. Moreover, CoT-Seg incorporates a self-correction stage: the model evaluates its own segmentation against the original query and reasoning trace, identifies mismatches, and iteratively refines the mask. This tight integration of reasoning and correction significantly improves reliability and robustness, especially in ambiguous or error-prone cases. Furthermore, our CoT-Seg framework allows easy incorporation of retrieval-augmented reasoning, enabling the system to access external knowledge when the input lacks sufficient information.

Neural baselines include U-Net, FPN, and a Swin Transformer, trained with coronary-only and merged coronary+catheter supervision. A second stage assigns vessel identity (LAD, LCX, RCA). External evaluation uses the public DCA1 cohort. SVR per-image tuning improves Dice over global means for all classical filters (e.g., Frangi: 0.759 vs. 0.741). Among deep models, FPN attains 0.914+/-0.007 Dice (coronary-only), and merged coronary+catheter labels further improve to 0.931+/-0.006. On DCA1 as a strict external test, Dice drops to 0.798 (coronary-only) and 0.814 (merged), while light in-domain fine-tuning recovers to 0.881+/-0.014 and 0.882+/-0.015. Vessel-type labeling achieves 98.5% accuracy (Dice 0.844) for RCA, 95.4% (0.786) for LAD, and 96.2% (0.794) for LCX. Learned per-image tuning strengthens classical pipelines, while high-resolution FPN models and merged-label supervision improve stability and external transfer with modest adaptation."}

Merely chasing higher Dice scores on idealized data fails to meet the safety requirements of real-world medical deployment. In this work, we propose BMDS-Net, a unified framework that prioritizes clinical robustness and trustworthiness over simple metric maximization. Our contribution is three-fold.

Second, and most importantly, we introduce a memory-efficient Bayesian fine-tuning strategy that transforms the network into a probabilistic predictor, providing voxel-wise uncertainty maps to highlight potential errors for clinicians. Third, comprehensive experiments on the BraTS 2021 dataset demonstrate that BMDS-Net not only maintains competitive accuracy but, more importantly, exhibits superior stability in missing-modality scenarios where baseline models fail.

Intriguingly, images differ in their attackability. Specifically, given an attack configuration, some images are easily corrupted, whereas others are more resistant. Evaluating image attackability has important applications in active learning, adversarial training, and attack enhancement. This prompts a growing interest in developing attackability measures. However, existing methods are scarce and suffer from two major limitations: (1) They rely on a model proxy to provide prior knowledge (e.g., gradients or minimal perturbation) to extract model-dependent image features. Unfortunately, in practice, many task-specific models are not readily accessible. (2) Extracted features characterizing image attackability lack visual interpretability, obscuring their direct relationship with the images. To address these, we propose a novel Object Texture Intensity (OTI), a model-free and visually interpretable measure of image attackability, which measures image attackability as the texture intensity of the image's semantic object. Theoretically, we describe the principles of OTI from the perspectives of decision boundaries as well as the mid- and high-frequency characteristics of adversarial perturbations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OTI is effective and computationally efficient. In addition, our OTI provides the adversarial machine learning community with a visual understanding of attackability."}

In this work, we identify a tool-specific attack surface and propose Sponge Tool Attack (STA), which disrupts agentic reasoning solely by rewriting the input prompt under a strict query-only access assumption. Without any modification on the underlying model or the external tools, STA converts originally concise and efficient reasoning trajectories into unnecessarily verbose and convoluted ones before arriving at the final answer. This results in substantial computational overhead while remaining stealthy by preserving the original task semantics and user intent. To achieve this, we design STA as an iterative, multi-agent collaborative framework with explicit rewritten policy control, and generates benign-looking prompt rewrites from the original one with high semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across 6 models (including both open-source models and closed-source APIs), 12 tools, 4 agentic frameworks, and 13 datasets spanning 5 domains validate the effectiveness of STA."}

We present SPACE-CLIP, an architecture that unlocks and interprets latent geometric knowledge directly from a frozen CLIP vision encoder, completely bypassing the text encoder and its associated textual prompts. A semantic pathway interprets high-level features, dynamically conditioned on global context using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM). In addition, a structural pathway extracts fine-grained spatial details from early layers. These complementary streams are hierarchically fused, enabling a robust synthesis of semantic context and precise geometry. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that SPACE-CLIP dramatically outperforms previous CLIP-based methods. Our ablation studies validate that the synergistic fusion of our dual pathways is critical to this success. SPACE-CLIP offers a new, efficient, and architecturally elegant blueprint for repurposing large-scale vision models.

To address this challenge, we introduce Prompt Grafting (PG), a training-free framework that combines explicit spatial cues in text with implicit layout guidance during sampling. PG runs a two-stage process where a layout prompt first establishes distinct regions and the target prompt is grafted once layout formation stabilizes. The framework enables food entanglement control: users can specify which food items should remain separated or be intentionally mixed by editing the arrangement of layouts. Across two food datasets, our method significantly improves the presence of target objects and provides qualitative evidence of controllable separation."}

Sparse-voxel rasterization provides continuous opacity fields and crisp geometry, but its typical uniform dense-grid initialization slows convergence and underutilizes scene structure.

Previous methods typically rely on cascaded sequences to handle this hierarchy, which fails to fully exploit the geometric relationships between cells, such as adjacency and sharing, limiting context awareness and error recovery. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm that reformulates B-Reps into sets of compositional $k$-cell particles. Our approach encodes each topological entity as a composition of particles, where adjacent cells share identical latents at their interfaces, thereby promoting geometric coupling along shared boundaries.

Second, a GoP-Adaptive Modulation (GAM) mechanism partitions videos into Groups-of-Pictures and learns group-specific priors. The mechanism modulates network parameters, enabling adaptive representations across different GoPs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeNeRV consistently outperforms existing INR-based methods in rate-distortion performance, validating the effectiveness of our proposed approach."}

In real-world scenarios, Pixel-level change labels are expensive to acquire, and existing models struggle to adapt to scenarios with diverse annotation availability. To tackle this challenge, we propose a unified change detection framework (UniCD), which collaboratively handles supervised, weakly-supervised, and unsupervised tasks through a coupled architecture. UniCD eliminates architectural barriers through a shared encoder and multi-branch collaborative learning mechanism, achieving deep coupling of heterogeneous supervision signals. Specifically, UniCD consists of three supervision-specific branches. In the supervision branch, UniCD introduces the spatial-temporal awareness module (STAM), achieving efficient synergistic fusion of bi-temporal features. In the weakly-supervised branch, we construct change representation regularization (CRR), which steers model convergence from coarse-grained activations toward coherent and separable change modeling. In the unsupervised branch, we propose semantic prior-driven change inference (SPCI), which transforms unsupervised tasks into controlled weakly-supervised path optimization. Experiments on mainstream datasets demonstrate that UniCD achieves optimal performance across three tasks. It exhibits significant accuracy improvements in weakly and unsupervised scenarios, surpassing current state-of-the-art by 12.72% and 12.37% on LEVIR-CD, respectively."}

In this work, we propose and address the challenging Multi-View S2V (MV-S2V) task, which synthesizes videos from multiple reference views to enforce 3D-level subject consistency. Regarding the scarcity of training data, we first develop a synthetic data curation pipeline to generate highly customized synthetic data, complemented by a small-scale real-world captured dataset to boost the training of MV-S2V. Another key issue lies in the potential confusion between cross-subject and cross-view references in conditional generation. To overcome this, we further introduce Temporally Shifted RoPE (TS-RoPE) to distinguish between different subjects and distinct views of the same subject in reference conditioning.

Traditional methods, such as manual weighing using a walk-over weighing system or proximate measurements using body condition scoring, involve manual handling of stock and can impact productivity from both a stock and economic perspective. To address these issues, this study investigated a cost-effective, non-contact method for live weight calculation in cattle using 3D reconstruction. The proposed pipeline utilized multi-view RGB images with SAM 3D-based agreement-guided fusion, followed by ensemble regression. Our approach generates a single 3D point cloud per animal and compares classical ensemble models with deep learning models under low-data conditions. Results show that SAM 3D with multi-view agreement fusion outperforms other 3D generation methods, while classical ensemble models provide the most consistent performance for practical farm scenarios (R$^2$ = 0.69 $\\pm$ 0.10, MAPE = 2.22 $\\pm$ 0.56 \\%), making this practical for on-farm implementation. These findings demonstrate that improving reconstruction quality is more critical than increasing model complexity for scalable deployment on farms where producing a large volume of 3D data is challenging."}

To address these challenges, we propose a Visual and Textual Semantic Collaborative Pruning framework (ViTCoP) that combines redundancy filtering in the vision encoder with step-wise co-pruning within the LLM based on its hierarchical characteristics, to efficiently preserve critical and informationally diverse visual tokens. Meanwhile, to ensure compatibility with acceleration techniques like FlashAttention, we introduce the L2 norm of K-vectors as the token saliency metric in the LLM. Extensive experiments on various Large Vision-Language Models demonstrate that ViTCoP not only achieves state-of-the-art performance surpassing existing methods on both image and video understanding tasks, but also significantly reduces model inference latency and GPU memory consumption. Notably, its performance advantage over other methods becomes even more pronounced under extreme pruning rates."}

Yet, a persistent limitation remains: while reconstructed images often appear naturalistic and holistically similar to the target stimuli, they frequently suffer from severe semantic misalignment -- salient objects are often replaced or hallucinated despite high visual quality. In this work, we address this limitation by rethinking the role of explicit semantic interpretation in fMRI decoding. We argue that existing methods rely too heavily on entangled visual embeddings which prioritize low-level appearance cues -- such as texture and global gist -- over explicit semantic identity. To overcome this, we parse fMRI signals into rich, sentence-level semantic descriptions that mirror the hierarchical and compositional nature of human visual understanding. We achieve this by leveraging grounded VLMs to generate synthetic, human-like, multi-granularity textual representations that capture object identities and spatial organization. Built upon this foundation, we propose SynMind, a framework that integrates these explicit semantic encodings with visual priors to condition a pretrained diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SynMind outperforms state-of-the-art methods across most quantitative metrics. Notably, by offloading semantic reasoning to our text-alignment module, SynMind surpasses competing methods based on SDXL while using the much smaller Stable Diffusion 1.4 and a single consumer GPU. Large-scale human evaluations further confirm that SynMind produces reconstructions more consistent with human visual perception. Neurovisualization analyses reveal that SynMind engages broader and more semantically relevant brain regions, mitigating the over-reliance on high-level visual areas."}

To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight domain generalization framework with quantum-enhanced collaborative learning, enabling robust generalization to unseen target domains without relying on real multi-center labeled data. Specifically, a MobileNetV2-based domain-invariant encoder is constructed and optimized through three key components: (1) multi-domain imaging shift simulation using brightness, contrast, sharpening, and noise perturbations to emulate heterogeneous acquisition conditions; (2) domain-adversarial training with gradient reversal to suppress domain-discriminative features; and (3) a lightweight quantum feature enhancement layer that applies parameterized quantum circuits for nonlinear feature mapping and entanglement modeling.

In this work, we introduce MV-SAM, a framework for multi-view segmentation that achieves 3D consistency using pointmaps -- 3D points reconstructed from unposed images by recent visual geometry models. Leveraging the pixel-point one-to-one correspondence of pointmaps, MV-SAM lifts images and prompts into 3D space, eliminating the need for explicit 3D networks or annotated 3D data. Specifically, MV-SAM extends SAM by lifting image embeddings from its pretrained encoder into 3D point embeddings, which are decoded by a transformer using cross-attention with 3D prompt embeddings. This design aligns 2D interactions with 3D geometry, enabling the model to implicitly learn consistent masks across views through 3D positional embeddings.

Previous 3D reconstruction kernels, such as Gaussians, Exponential functions, and Student's t distributions, serve as the low pass filters to isolate the baseband spectrum. However, their unideal low-pass property results in the overlap of high-frequency components with low-frequency components in the discrete-time signal's spectrum. To this end, we introduce Jinc kernel with an instantaneous drop to zero magnitude exactly at the cutoff frequency, which is corresponding to the ideal low pass filters. As Jinc kernel suffers from low decay speed in the spatial domain, we further propose modulated kernels to strick an effective balance, and achieves superior rendering performance by reconciling spatial efficiency and frequency-domain fidelity.

These methods act as a shortcut to achieve dense features for a fraction of the cost by learning to map low-resolution features to high-resolution versions. While early works in this space used iterative upsampling approaches, more recent works have switched to cross-attention-based methods, which risk falling into the same efficiency scaling problems of the backbones they are upsampling. In this work, we demonstrate that iterative upsampling methods can still compete with cross-attention-based methods; moreover, they can achieve state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs. We propose UPLiFT, an architecture for Universal Pixel-dense Lightweight Feature Transforms. We also propose an efficient Local Attender operator to overcome the limitations of prior iterative feature upsampling methods. This operator uses an alternative attentional pooling formulation defined fully locally. We show that our Local Attender allows UPLiFT to maintain stable features throughout upsampling, enabling state-of-the-art performance with lower inference costs than existing pixel-dense feature upsamplers. In addition, we apply UPLiFT to generative downstream tasks and show that it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art Coupled Flow Matching models for VAE feature upsampling. Altogether, UPLiFT offers a versatile and efficient approach to creating denser features."}

Combining data-driven experts, which capture novel patterns, with domain-expert-guided experts, which encode accumulated clinical insights, provides complementary strengths for robust and clinically meaningful learning. To this end, we propose Domain-Knowledge-Guided Hybrid MoE (DKGH-MoE), a plug-and-play and interpretable module that unifies data-driven learning with domain expertise.

In this work, we present MorphXAI, an explainable framework that unifies parasite detection with fine-grained morphological analysis. MorphXAI integrates morphological supervision directly into the prediction pipeline, enabling the model to localize parasites while simultaneously characterizing clinically relevant attributes such as shape, curvature, visible dot count, flagellum presence, and developmental stage. To support this task, we curate a clinician-annotated dataset of three parasite species (Leishmania, Trypanosoma brucei, and Trypanosoma cruzi) with detailed morphological labels, establishing a new benchmark for interpretable parasite analysis.

Multispectral modalities (visible light and thermal) can boost pedestrian detection performance by providing complementary visual information. Several gaps remain with multispectral pedestrian detection methods. First, existing approaches primarily focus on spatial fusion and often neglect temporal information. Second, RGB and thermal image pairs in multispectral benchmarks may not always be perfectly aligned. Pedestrians are also challenging to detect due to varying lighting conditions, occlusion, etc. This work proposes Strip-Fusion, a spatial-temporal fusion network that is robust to misalignment in input images, as well as varying lighting conditions and heavy occlusions. The Strip-Fusion pipeline integrates temporally adaptive convolutions to dynamically weigh spatial-temporal features, enabling our model to better capture pedestrian motion and context over time. A novel Kullback-Leibler divergence loss was designed to mitigate modality imbalance between visible and thermal inputs, guiding feature alignment toward the more informative modality during training. Furthermore, a novel post-processing algorithm was developed to reduce false positives. Extensive experimental results show that our method performs competitively for both the KAIST and the CVC-14 benchmarks. We also observed significant improvements compared to previous state-of-the-art on challenging conditions such as heavy occlusion and misalignment."}

Integrating topological properties, such as connectivity, improves segmentation accuracy and consistency. However, extracting and embedding such properties - especially from Persistence Diagrams (PD) - is challenging due to their non-differentiability and computational cost. Existing approaches mostly encode topology through handcrafted loss functions, which generalize poorly across tasks. In this paper, we propose PIs-Regressor, a simple yet effective module that learns persistence image (PI) - finite, differentiable representations of topological features - directly from data. Together with Topology SegNet, which fuses these features in both downsampling and upsampling stages, our framework integrates topology into the network architecture itself rather than auxiliary losses. Unlike existing methods that depend heavily on handcrafted loss functions, our approach directly incorporates topological information into the network structure, leading to more robust segmentation. Our design is flexible and can be seamlessly combined with other topology-based methods to further enhance segmentation performance. Experimental results show that integrating topological features enhances model robustness, effectively handling challenges like overexposure and blurring in medical imaging. Our approach on three curvilinear benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level accuracy and topological fidelity."}

To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised hyperspectral classification framework integrating spatial prior information with a dynamic learning mechanism. First, we design an Edge-Aware Superpixel Label Propagation (EASLP) module. By integrating edge intensity penalty with neighborhood correction strategy, it mitigates label diffusion from superpixel segmentation while enhancing classification robustness in boundary regions. Second, we introduce a Dynamic History-Fused Prediction (DHP) method. By maintaining historical predictions and dynamically weighting them with current results, DHP smoothens pseudo-label fluctuations and improves temporal consistency and noise resistance. Concurrently, incorporating condifence and consistency measures, the Adaptive Tripartite Sample Categorization (ATSC) strategy implements hierarchical utilization of easy, ambiguous, and hard samples, leading to enhanced pseudo-label quality and learning efficiency. The Dynamic Reliability-Enhanced Pseudo-Label Framework (DREPL), composed of DHP and ATSC, strengthens pseudo-label stability across temporal and sample domains.

To address this, this paper proposes a self-supervised cross-domain transfer framework that learns transferable spectral-spatial joint representations without source labels and achieves efficient adaptation under few samples in the target domain. During the self-supervised pre-training phase, a Spatial-Spectral Transformer (S2Former) module is designed. It adopts a dual-branch spatial-spectral transformer and introduces a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism to achieve spectral-spatial collaborative modeling: the spatial branch enhances structural awareness through random masking, while the spectral branch captures fine-grained differences. Both branches mutually guide each other to improve semantic consistency. We further propose a Frequency Domain Constraint (FDC) to maintain frequency-domain consistency through real Fast Fourier Transform (rFFT) and high-frequency magnitude loss, thereby enhancing the model's capability to discern fine details and boundaries. During the fine-tuning phase, we introduce a Diffusion-Aligned Fine-tuning (DAFT) distillation mechanism. This aligns semantic evolution trajectories through a teacher-student structure, enabling robust transfer learning under low-label conditions.

However, the shrinking operation loses the visual features of text margins and confuses the foreground and background difference, which brings intrinsic limitations to recognize text features. We follow this issue and design Text-Pass Filter (TPF) for arbitrary-shaped text detection. It segments the whole text directly, which avoids the intrinsic limitations. It is noteworthy that different from previous whole text region-based methods, TPF can separate adhesive texts naturally without complex decoding or post-processing processes, which makes it possible for real-time text detection. Concretely, we find that the band-pass filter allows through components in a specified band of frequencies, called its passband but blocks components with frequencies above or below this band. It provides a natural idea for extracting whole texts separately. By simulating the band-pass filter, TPF constructs a unique feature-filter pair for each text. In the inference stage, every filter extracts the corresponding matched text by passing its pass-feature and blocking other features. Meanwhile, considering the large aspect ratio problem of ribbon-like texts makes it hard to recognize texts wholly, a Reinforcement Ensemble Unit (REU) is designed to enhance the feature consistency of the same text and to enlarge the filter's recognition field to help recognize whole texts. Furthermore, a Foreground Prior Unit (FPU) is introduced to encourage TPF to discriminate the difference between the foreground and background, which improves the feature-filter pair quality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of REU and FPU while showing the TPF's superiority."}

Moreover, major symptoms of lung cancer are hard to differentiate with other respiratory disease symptoms such as COPD, further leading patients to overlook cancer progression in early stages. Thus, to enhance survival rates in lung cancer, early detection from consistent proactive respiratory system monitoring becomes crucial. One of the most prevalent and effective methods for lung cancer monitoring would be low-dose computed tomography(LDCT) chest scans, which led to remarkable enhancements in lung cancer detection or tumor classification tasks under rapid advancements and applications of computer vision based AI models such as EfficientNet or ResNet in image processing. However, though advanced CNN models under transfer learning or ViT based models led to high performing lung cancer detections, due to its intrinsic limitations in terms of correlation dependence and low interpretability due to complexity, expansions of deep learning models to lung cancer treatment analysis or causal intervention analysis simulations are still limited. Therefore, this research introduced LungCRCT: a latent causal representation learning based lung cancer analysis framework that retrieves causal representations of factors within the physical causal mechanism of lung cancer progression. With the use of advanced graph autoencoder based causal discovery algorithms with distance Correlation disentanglement and entropy-based image reconstruction refinement, LungCRCT not only enables causal intervention analysis for lung cancer treatments, but also leads to robust, yet extremely light downstream models in malignant tumor classification tasks with an AUC score of 93.91%."}

In this paper, we introduce FoGA, a lightweight VAD model that performs Forward consistency learning with Gated context Aggregation, containing about 2M parameters and tailored for potential edge devices. Specifically, we propose a Unet-based method that performs feature extraction on consecutive frames to generate both immediate and forward predictions. Then, we introduce a gated context aggregation module into the skip connections to dynamically fuse encoder and decoder features at the same spatial scale. Finally, the model is jointly optimized with a novel forward consistency loss, and a hybrid anomaly measurement strategy is adopted to integrate errors from both immediate and forward frames for more accurate detection.

Unlike conventional RAG that retrieves from static corpora, QualiRAG dynamically generates auxiliary knowledge by decomposing questions into structured requests and constructing four complementary knowledge sources: \\textit{visual metadata}, \\textit{subject localization}, \\textit{global quality summaries}, and \\textit{local quality descriptions}, followed by relevance-aware retrieval for evidence-grounded reasoning. Extensive experiments show that QualiRAG achieves substantial improvements over open-source general-purpose LMMs and VQA-finetuned LMMs on visual quality understanding tasks, and delivers competitive performance on visual quality comparison tasks, demonstrating robust quality assessment capabilities without any task-specific training. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/clh124/QualiRAG."}

Remarkable progresses have been achieved while the existing methods typically treat it as a direct regression or iterative refinement problem and often struggling to capture complex geometric transformations or generalize across different domains. In this work, we propose HomoFM, a new framework that introduces the flow matching technique from generative modeling into the homography estimation task for the first time. Unlike the existing methods, we formulate homography estimation problem as a velocity field learning problem. By modeling a continuous and point-wise velocity field that transforms noisy distributions into registered coordinates, the proposed network recovers high-precision transformations through a conditional flow trajectory. Furthermore, to address the challenge of domain shifts issue, e.g., the cases of multimodal matching or varying illumination scenarios, we integrate a gradient reversal layer (GRL) into the feature extraction backbone. This domain adaptation strategy explicitly constrains the encoder to learn domain-invariant representations, significantly enhancing the network's robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that HomoFM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both estimation accuracy and robustness on standard benchmarks.

Although recent approaches using large CNNs such as VGG and ResNet achieve reasonable accuracy, they are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, limiting their practicality for real-time applications. We address these challenges using a lightweight and efficient facial emotion recognition pipeline based on EfficientNetB2, trained using a two-stage warm-up and fine-tuning strategy. The model is enhanced with AdamW optimization, decoupled weight decay, label smoothing (epsilon = 0.06) to reduce annotation noise, and clipped class weights to mitigate class imbalance, along with dropout, mixed-precision training, and extensive real-time data augmentation. The model is trained using a stratified 87.5%/12.5% train-validation split while keeping the official test set intact, achieving a test accuracy of 68.78% with nearly ten times fewer parameters than VGG16-based baselines.

However, their outputs remain vulnerable to hallucinations (i.e., responses that contradict visual facts), posing significant risks in high-stakes medical scenarios. Recent introspective detection methods, particularly uncertainty-based approaches, offer computational efficiency but are fundamentally indirect, as they estimate predictive uncertainty for an image-question pair rather than verifying the factual correctness of a specific answer. To address this limitation, we propose Visual Logical Loop Verification (V-Loop), a training-free and plug-and-play framework for hallucination detection in medical VQA. V-Loop introduces a bidirectional reasoning process that forms a visually grounded logical loop to verify factual correctness. Given an input, the MLLM produces an answer for the primary input pair. V-Loop extracts semantic units from the primary QA pair, generates a verification question by conditioning on the answer unit to re-query the question unit, and enforces visual attention consistency to ensure answering both primary question and verification question rely on the same image evidence. If the verification answer matches the expected semantic content, the logical loop closes, indicating factual grounding; otherwise, the primary answer is flagged as hallucinated. Extensive experiments on multiple medical VQA benchmarks and MLLMs show that V-Loop consistently outperforms existing introspective methods, remains highly efficient, and further boosts uncertainty-based approaches when used in combination."}

This paper proposes a vision-language-model (VLM) guided framework that accelerates and stabilizes multi-material parameter estimation in a differentiable RT (DRT) engine. A VLM parses scene images to infer material categories and maps them to quantitative priors via an ITU-R material table, yielding informed conductivity initializations. The VLM further selects informative transmitter/receiver placements that promote diverse, material-discriminative paths. Starting from these priors, the DRT performs gradient-based refinement using measured received signal strengths. Experiments in NVIDIA Sionna on indoor scenes show 2-4$\\times$ faster convergence and 10-100$\\times$ lower final parameter error compared with uniform or random initialization and random placement baselines, achieving sub-0.1\\% mean relative error with only a few receivers. Complexity analyses indicate per-iteration time scales near-linearly with the number of materials and measurement setups, while VLM-guided placement reduces the measurements required for accurate recovery. Ablations over RT depth and ray counts confirm further accuracy gains without significant per-iteration overhead.

Current artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in orthopedics predominantly rely on task-specific, supervised learning paradigms. These methods are inherently fragmented, require extensive annotated datasets, and often lack generalizability across different modalities and clinical scenarios. The development of foundation models in this field has been constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, curated, and open-source musculoskeletal datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce OrthoFoundation, a multimodal vision foundation model optimized for musculoskeletal pathology. We constructed a pre-training dataset of 1.2 million unlabeled knee X-ray and MRI images from internal and public databases. Utilizing a Dinov3 backbone, the model was trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to capture robust radiological representations. OrthoFoundation achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across 14 downstream tasks. It attained superior accuracy in X-ray osteoarthritis diagnosis and ranked first in MRI structural injury detection. The model demonstrated remarkable label efficiency, matching supervised baselines using only 50% of labeled data. Furthermore, despite being pre-trained on knee images, OrthoFoundation exhibited exceptional cross-anatomy generalization to the hip, shoulder, and ankle. OrthoFoundation represents a significant advancement toward general-purpose AI for musculoskeletal imaging. By learning fundamental, joint-agnostic radiological semantics from large-scale multimodal data, it overcomes the limitations of conventional models, which provides a robust framework for reducing annotation burdens and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice."}

However, a major challenge in this projection is the many-to-one conflict, where multiple 3D points are mapped onto the same pixel in the range image, requiring a selection strategy. Existing approaches typically retain the point with the smallest depth (closest to the LiDAR), disregarding semantic relevance and object structure, which leads to the loss of important contextual information. In this paper, we extend the depth-based selection rule by incorporating contextual information from both instance centers and class labels, introducing two mechanisms: \\textit{Centerness-Aware Projection (CAP)} and \\textit{Class-Weighted-Aware Projection (CWAP)}. In CAP, point depths are adjusted according to their distance from the instance center, thereby prioritizing central instance points over noisy boundary and background points. In CWAP, object classes are prioritized through user-defined weights, offering flexibility in the projection strategy. Our evaluations on the SemanticKITTI dataset show that CAP preserves more instance points during projection, achieving up to a 3.1\\% mIoU improvement compared to the baseline.

Two tumor aware experimental setups are introduced to address class-specific diagnostic challenges. The first setup employs a Boosted Feature Space (BFS), where independently customized DenseNet and Swint branches learn complementary local and global representations that are dimension aligned, fused, and boosted, enabling highly sensitive detection of diffuse glioma patterns by successfully learning the features of irregular shape, poorly defined mass, and heterogeneous texture. The second setup adopts a hierarchical DenseNet Swint architecture with Deep Feature Extraction have Dual Residual connections (DFE and DR), in which DenseNet serves as a stem CNN for structured local feature learning, while Swin_t models global tumor morphology, effectively suppressing false negatives in meningioma and pituitary tumor classification by learning the features of well defined mass, location (outside brain) and enlargments in tumors (dural tail or upward extension). DenseNet is customized at the input level to match MRI spatial characteristics, leveraging dense residual connectivity to preserve texture information and mitigate vanishing-gradient effects. In parallel, Swint is tailored through task aligned patch embedding and shifted-window self attention to efficiently capture hierarchical global dependencies. Extensive evaluation on a large-scale MRI dataset (stringent 40,260 images across four tumor classes) demonstrates consistent superiority over standalone CNNs, Vision Transformers, and hybrids, achieving 98.50 accuracy and recall on the test unseen dataset."}

The system integrates three components -- slice classification, inner ear localization, and sequence-specific segmentation -- into a single workflow that computes per-ear endolymphatic-to-vestibular volume ratios (ELR) directly from whole MRI volumes, eliminating the need for manual intervention.\n  Trained with only 3 to 6 annotated slices per patient, OREHAS generalized effectively to full 3D volumes, achieving Dice scores of 0.90 for SPACE-MRC and 0.75 for REAL-IR. In an external validation cohort with complete manual annotations, OREHAS closely matched expert ground truth (VSI = 74.3%) and substantially outperformed the clinical syngo.via software (VSI = 42.5%), which tended to overestimate endolymphatic volumes. Across 19 test patients, vestibular measurements from OREHAS were consistent with syngo.via, while endolymphatic volumes were systematically smaller and more physiologically realistic.\n  These results show that reliable and reproducible EH quantification can be achieved from standard MRI using limited supervision. By combining efficient deep-learning-based segmentation with a clinically aligned volumetric workflow, OREHAS reduces operator dependence, ensures methodological consistency. Besides, the results are compatible with established imaging protocols. The approach provides a robust foundation for large-scale studies and for recalibrating clinical diagnostic thresholds based on accurate volumetric measurements of the inner ear."}

Since pirated images are often geometrically distorted by operations such as scaling and cropping, accurate synchronization - detecting the embedding position of the watermark - is critical for proper extraction. In particular, cropping changes the origin of the image, making synchronization difficult. However, few existing methods are robust against cropping. To address this issue, we propose a watermarking method that estimates geometric transformations applied to a stego image using a pilot signal, allowing synchronization even after cropping. A grid-shaped pilot signal with distinct horizontal and vertical values is embedded in the image. When the image is transformed, the grid is also distorted. By analyzing this distortion, the transformation matrix can be estimated. Applying the Radon transform to the distorted image allows estimation of the grid angles and intervals. In addition, since the horizontal and vertical grid lines are encoded differently, the grid orientation can be determined, which reduces ambiguity. To validate our method, we performed simulations with anisotropic scaling, rotation, shearing, and cropping. The results show that the proposed method accurately estimates transformation matrices with low error under both single and composite attacks."}

We argue that performance is fundamentally I/O-bound. We show that structuring analysis as streaming passes over data is crucial. For 3D volumes, two representations are popular: stacks of 2D slices (e.g., directories or multi-page TIFF) and 3D chunked layouts (e.g., Zarr/HDF5). While for a few algorithms, chunked layout on disk is crucial to keep disk I/O at a minimum, we show how the slice-based streaming architecture can be built on top of either image representation in a manner that minimizes disk I/O. This is in particular advantageous for algorithms relying on neighbouring values, since the slicing streaming architecture is 1D, which implies that there are only 2 possible sweeping orders, both of which are aligned with the order in which images are read from the disk. This is in contrast to 3D chunks, in which any sweep cannot be done without accessing each chunk at least 9 times. We formalize this with sweep-based execution (natural 2D/3D orders), windowed operations, and overlap-aware tiling to minimize redundant access. Building on these principles, we introduce a domain-specific language (DSL) that encodes algorithms with intrinsic knowledge of their optimal streaming and memory use; the DSL performs compile-time and run-time pipeline analyses to automatically select window sizes, fuse stages, tee and zip streams, and schedule passes for limited-RAM machines, yielding near-linear I/O scans and predictable memory footprints. The approach integrates with existing tooling for segmentation and morphology but reframes pre/post-processing as pipelines that privilege sequential read/write patterns, delivering substantial throughput gains for extremely large images without requiring full-volume residency in memory."}

This paper builds upon previous work on affective state recognition from children's drawings by presenting a comparative evaluation of machine learning models for emotion classification. Three deep learning architectures -- MobileNet, EfficientNet, and VGG16 -- are evaluated within a unified experimental framework to analyze classification performance, robustness, and computational efficiency. The models are trained using transfer learning on a dataset of children's drawings annotated with emotional labels provided by psychological experts. The results highlight important trade-offs between lightweight and deeper architectures when applied to drawing-based affective computing tasks, particularly in mobile and real-time application contexts."}

Here, the effects of GPA-induced contamination are formally characterised using controlled 2D and 3D simulations across varying sample sizes, landmark densities, and allometric patterns. A novel realignment procedure is proposed, whereby test specimens are aligned to the training set prior to model fitting, eliminating cross-sample dependency. Simulations reveal a robust \"diagonal\" in sample-size vs. landmark-space, reflecting the scaling of RMSE under isotropic variation, with slopes analytically derived from the degrees of freedom in Procrustes tangent space. The importance of spatial autocorrelation among landmarks is further demonstrated using linear and convolutional regression models, highlighting performance degradation when landmark relationships are ignored.

Crucially, unlike existing modular systems constrained by static pipelines, this design enables autonomous multi-turn interactions where the agent generates multimodal chains-of-thought encompassing reasoning, tool invocation, judgment, and reflection to iteratively refine outputs. We employ a two-stage training strategy: first, cold-start with supervised fine-tuning on high-quality tool invocation and reflection data to bootstrap agent behaviors; second, end-to-end agentic reinforcement learning combining pointwise rewards (final image quality) and pairwise rewards (reflection accuracy), with trajectory resampling for enhanced multi-turn exploration.

Motivated by our empirical analysis of the strong \\textit{intra-} and \\textit{inter-image} similarities from the perspective of texture, color, and semantics, we propose a reference-based Martian asymmetrical image compression (REMAC) approach, which shifts computational complexity from the encoder to the resource-rich decoder and simultaneously improves compression performance. To leverage \\textit{inter-image} similarities, we propose a reference-guided entropy module and a ref-decoder that utilize useful information from reference images, reducing redundant operations at the encoder and achieving superior compression performance. To exploit \\textit{intra-image} similarities, the ref-decoder adopts a deep, multi-scale architecture with enlarged receptive field size to model long-range spatial dependencies. Additionally, we develop a latent feature recycling mechanism to further alleviate the extreme computational constraints on Mars.

To address this challenge, we propose SDA-QEC (Simplified Diffusion Augmentation with Quantum-Enhanced Classification), an innovative framework that integrates simplified diffusion-based data augmentation with quantum-enhanced feature discrimination. Our approach employs a lightweight diffusion augmentor to generate high-quality synthetic samples for minority classes, rebalancing the training distribution. Subsequently, a quantum feature layer embedded within MobileNetV2 architecture enhances the model's discriminative capability through high-dimensional feature mapping in Hilbert space. Comprehensive experiments on coronary angiography image classification demonstrate that SDA-QEC achieves 98.33% accuracy, 98.78% AUC, and 98.33% F1-score, significantly outperforming classical baselines including ResNet18, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and VGG16.

We propose an efficient AI-enabled Satellite Edge Computing paradigm for hyperspectral image classification, facilitating the satellites to attain autonomous decision-making.

Moreover, onboard processing on satellites could be faced with sensor failure and scan pattern errors, which result in degraded image quality with bad/misaligned pixels and mixed noise. To address these challenges, we develop a novel two-stage pixel-wise label propagation scheme that utilizes only intrinsic spectral features at the single pixel level without the necessity to consider spatial structural information as requested by deep neural networks. In the first stage, initial pixel labels are obtained by propagating selected anchor labels through the constructed anchor-pixel affinity matrix. Subsequently, a top-k pruned sparse graph is generated by directly computing pixel-level similarities. In the second stage, a closed-form solution derived from the sparse graph is employed to replace iterative computations.

Our model predicts a spatially varying mixing field at every reverse step and injects an explicit, target-consistent restoration term into the drift. This in-step guidance keeps large updates on-manifold and shifts the model's role from global alignment to local residual correction. We provide a continuous-time formulation with an exact solution form and derive a practical first-order sampler that preserves marginal consistency.

GAP integrates complementary metrics that disentangle overall video quality from attraction-specific knowledge, including global structural alignment, fine-grained keypoint-based alignment, and vision-language model judgments, all validated against human evaluation. Applying GAP to the state-of-the-art text-to-video model Sora 2, we find that, contrary to common assumptions of strong geographic bias, the model exhibits a relatively uniform level of geographically grounded visual knowledge across regions, development levels, and cultural groupings, with only weak dependence on attraction popularity. These results suggest that current text-to-video models express global visual knowledge more evenly than expected, highlighting both their promise for globally deployed applications and the need for continued evaluation as such systems evolve."}

Although agricultural settings have been studied in the context of object classification and segmentation, the place recognition task for mobile robots is not trivial in the current state of the art. In this study, we propose MinkUNeXt-VINE, a lightweight, deep-learning-based method that surpasses state-of-the-art methods in vineyard environments thanks to its pre-processing and Matryoshka Representation Learning multi-loss approach. Our method prioritizes enhanced performance with low-cost, sparse LiDAR inputs and lower-dimensionality outputs to ensure high efficiency in real-time scenarios. Additionally, we present a comprehensive ablation study of the results on various evaluation cases and two extensive long-term vineyard datasets employing different LiDAR sensors. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the trade-off output produced by this approach, as well as its robust performance on low-cost and low-resolution input data. The code is publicly available for reproduction."}

A Case Study on Monument Style Classification", "comment": "28 pages", "summary": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a fundamental requirement for the reliable deployment of artificial intelligence applications in open-world environments. However, addressing the heterogeneous nature of OOD data, ranging from low-level corruption to semantic shifts, remains a complex challenge that single-stage detectors often fail to resolve. To address this issue, we propose SeNeDiF-OOD, a novel methodology based on Semantic Nested Dichotomy Fusion. This framework decomposes the detection task into a hierarchical structure of binary fusion nodes, where each layer is designed to integrate decision boundaries aligned with specific levels of semantic abstraction. To validate the proposed framework, we present a comprehensive case study using MonuMAI, a real-world architectural style recognition system exposed to an open environment. This application faces a diverse range of inputs, including non-monument images, unknown architectural styles, and adversarial attacks, making it an ideal testbed for our proposal. Through extensive experimental evaluation in this domain, results demonstrate that our hierarchical fusion methodology significantly outperforms traditional baselines, effectively filtering these diverse OOD categories while preserving in-distribution performance."}

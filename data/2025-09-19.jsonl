To tackle this\nproblem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface\ndetection and fitting is proposed.

Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification\nframework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D\nreasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the\nfirst stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for\ngenerating candidate rankings.

In this paper, we\nutilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot\nsolution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to\ndynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \\textit{grounding tokens},\nfor grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal\ngrounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query\n(\\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we\npropose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel\ndecomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented\nassembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH\nstrategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action\nsub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and\ntemporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to\nlearn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token\npredictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action\ncues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and\ntemporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the\nattribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS\nstrategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the\ntemporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We\nevaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods\non three common STVG benchmarks.\n  The code will be available at https://github.com/zaiquanyang/LLaVA_Next_STVG."}

We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image\ndataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season\ncrop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting\ndetermines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as\nreplanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and\nerror-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD\ncontains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse\ngrowth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,\nand densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows\ndetection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among\ntested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for\nsingle plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall\nup to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity\nand irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further\nreduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11\nmaintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for\nsaving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that\nenhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time\ndecision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural\nmonitoring and advancing precision agriculture."}

As a generative paradigm originally\ndesigned for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges.\nIn this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms\nof applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We\nidentify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual\nsemantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency,\nand spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively\naddressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to\na novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models\n(ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR\nsignificantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models\nand leads to improved generation quality.

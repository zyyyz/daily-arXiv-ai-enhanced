To make fine-tuning more cost-effective,\nrecent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF),\nwhich replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks\nrely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create\ncalibrated scalar rewards -- an expensive and restrictive pipeline.

In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework\nthat directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a\nphysics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically\ngrounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our\napproach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial\nrays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as\npolicy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy\n3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual\nfeatures from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both\ndetailed pose and global positioning.

Specifically, we target\nthe representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,\ndetector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we\ndefine modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging\nmodality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate\nthe modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context\nAttention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to\npropagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style\narchitectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into\nobject queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that\naligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific\ncontrastive objective with modality-balanced batches.

Existing generative methods rely\nsolely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or\ndepth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,\na novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce\ngeometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior\nimage-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the\ndiffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,\nand applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference\ncues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch\nsynthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other\nextracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint\nself-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To\naddress regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the\ntarget view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked\nduring training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful\ncues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a\ngeometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking\nstrategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for\ngeometry-conditioned image completion.

We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER\ntokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference\npositions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate\ncoordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial\nencoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,\naddressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on\nScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in\ngrounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution\ninterfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on\nimplicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across\ndiverse resolutions and platforms."}

We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that\nleverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our\napproach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled\ndata using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we\nselectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering,\nenabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge\nduring distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA\ndemonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under\nminimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML\nframework."}

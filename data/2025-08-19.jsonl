For video generation, we introduce a\n\\textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a\nperspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation,\nrespectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates\ncomprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene\nreconstruction, we propose a \\textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model}\nbased on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using\nmetric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our\nmethod ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the\nreconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed designs and the superiority of TiP4GEN in generating visually\ncompelling and motion-coherent dynamic panoramic scenes.

As artificial\nvision systems increasingly perform human-like tasks, it is important to ask:\ndoes AI experience illusions, too? Does it have unique illusions?

Leveraging a marker-joint chain inference mechanism,\nOpenMoCap enables simultaneous optimization and construction of deep\nconstraints between markers and joints. Extensive comparative experiments\ndemonstrate that OpenMoCap consistently outperforms competing methods across\ndiverse scenarios, while the CMU-Occlu dataset opens the door for future\nstudies in robust motion solving. The proposed OpenMoCap is integrated into the\nMoSen MoCap system for practical deployment. The code is released at:\nhttps://github.com/qianchen214/OpenMoCap."}

How to learn effective feature representations and how to explore\nthe similarities between different image sets are two key yet challenging\nissues in this field. However, existing traditional ISC methods classify image\nsets based on raw pixel features, ignoring the importance of feature learning.\nExisting deep ISC methods can learn deep features, but they fail to adaptively\nadjust the features when measuring set distances, resulting in limited\nperformance in few-shot ISC. To address the above issues, this paper combines\ntraditional ISC methods with deep models and proposes a novel few-shot ISC\napproach called Deep Class-specific Collaborative Representation (DCSCR)\nnetwork to simultaneously learn the frame- and concept-level feature\nrepresentations of each image set and the distance similarities between\ndifferent sets. Specifically, DCSCR consists of a fully convolutional deep\nfeature extractor module, a global feature learning module, and a\nclass-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module. The\ndeep feature extractor and global feature learning modules are used to learn\n(local and global) frame-level feature representations, while the\nclass-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module is\nexploit to adaptively learn the concept-level feature representation of each\nimage set and thus obtain the distance similarities between different sets by\ndeveloping a new CSCR-based contrastive loss function.

Project Page:\n  https://mediated-reality.github.io/projects/yasunaga_ismar25/", "summary": "Novel view synthesis from images, for example, with 3D Gaussian splatting,\nhas made great progress. Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for\ndemanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting\nhumans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has\nreceived much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and\ndense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed\nby human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding\nof the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to\nguide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect\nview-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated\nvisualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of\na scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image\ncoverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we\nleverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a\nvision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked\nobjects to guide the user during scanning. Our results show superior\nperformance in real scenes compared to conventional view sampling strategies."}

Unlike human pose editing, which has advanced\nrapidly, shape editing remains relatively underexplored. Current approaches\ntypically rely on 3D morphable models or image warping, often introducing\nunrealistic body proportions, texture distortions, and background\ninconsistencies due to alignment errors and deformations. A key limitation is\nthe lack of large-scale, publicly available datasets for training and\nevaluating body shape manipulation methods. In this work, we introduce the\nfirst large-scale dataset of 18,573 images across 1523 subjects, specifically\ndesigned for controlled human shape editing. It features diverse variations in\nbody shape, including fat, muscular and thin, captured under consistent\nidentity, clothing, and background conditions. Using this dataset, we propose\nOdo, an end-to-end diffusion-based method that enables realistic and intuitive\nbody reshaping guided by simple semantic attributes. Our approach combines a\nfrozen UNet that preserves fine-grained appearance and background details from\nthe input image with a ControlNet that guides shape transformation using target\nSMPL depth maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nprior approaches, achieving per-vertex reconstruction errors as low as 7.5mm,\nsignificantly lower than the 13.6mm observed in baseline methods, while\nproducing realistic results that accurately match the desired target shapes."}

A primary challenge arises from ambiguity\nintroduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing\ncorresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as\nocclusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit\nphotometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that\nutilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along\nthe epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we\nfinetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions:\nleft-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the\nright camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right\ncameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit\nphotometric reconstruction. Our proposed DMS is a cost-free, ''plug-and-play''\nmethod that seamlessly enhances self-supervised stereo matching and monocular\ndepth estimation, and relies solely on unlabeled stereo image pairs for both\ntraining and synthesizing.

A rigorous comparative analysis is\nconducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and\nRT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of\ncoastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves\nmarginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\\% IoU\n(mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's\n0.810 and 0.606, respectively.

The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more\npractical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its\nsuperior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy.

However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict\nconsistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,\nwhich limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by\nconvolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection\naccuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a\nnovel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and\ndiffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,\nsubmanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure\ncomputational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth\nof the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)\ndiffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich\nspatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to\nstrengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features\nproduced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or\nSSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,\nhighlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several\nbenchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based\nmodels.

A\ncommon approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB\nsequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by\nmulti-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint\ndetection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint\noptimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and\nmutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a\nkey enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in\nthis work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object\n3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate\nthis with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover\nhand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely\non pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches\nstate-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D\ntransformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark.

In this work, we investigate the\neffects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured\ndriving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity\nimproves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We\nattribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality\nand dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures\nwithin temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these\nobjectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive\nnature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant\nscene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic\nbehavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize\nsurface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this\nphenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay\nfrom diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial\naccuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

Our\napproach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using\nInceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient\nmulti-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average\npooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)\nattention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local\nself-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on\nchallenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method\nachieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being\n8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way\nclassification testing.

The performance gap stems from the fact that\nautoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered\npoint sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local\npredictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but\nundermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering\nits ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,\nconsistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the\nlevel-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a\ncoarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at\nlow resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher\nscales through a next-scale prediction paradigm.

Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while\nstatic keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D\nto form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D\nSLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM\nattains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,\nmatching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS\non a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can\nreplace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,\nmarking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems."}

To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual\nquestion answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the\nintroduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation\nquality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between\nlighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered\nby Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are\nvisually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct\nEgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and\nrefinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked\nby annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs\nacross 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of\nhuman work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to\nnight, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.\nBeyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night\ncorrespondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further\nexplore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a\nstrong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research\nand for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the\ndata and code will be made available upon acceptance."}

Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage\npipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and\nheavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM\npre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies\n(\"everyone\"), dense 3D scene (\"everywhere\"), and camera trajectories in a\nsingle forward pass (\"all-at-once\"). Our method builds upon the 4D online\nreconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,\nto strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct\nreadout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates\nheavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the\nrelatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it\nachieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs\nmultiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at\nreal-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive\nperformance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human\nmesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a\nsingle unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong\nbaseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in\nhttps://fanegg.github.io/Human3R"}

To address this, we\npropose \\textbf{ID\\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization\nframework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale\nof our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and\nnon-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and\ncontrollable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional\ndiffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled\nLatent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity\nfeatures, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs\nand aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent\nHarmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on\nnoisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based\nreconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is\nachieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.\nTo further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity\nMapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source\nidentity vectors.

We revisit this\nlimitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional\ndifferences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space\nand the parameter space.

This study introduces a sensor-free approach that\nintegrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,\nand machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near\nreal time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is\ndelineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning\nmodel based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset\nthat includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations\nusing a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate\nreservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite\nimagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the\nproposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the\nshoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR\nperformance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and\ncoefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the\nrobustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution\nfor continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The\nproposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the\nresulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate\nchange and environmental patterns."}

This\nlimitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To\naddress this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,\nwhich we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors\n(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior\nto encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently\nutilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire\ncompression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis\ntransform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the\nresidual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach\nachieves an effective disentanglement of information streams.

The internal visual\nrepresentations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual\nunderstanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without\ncompromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach\nintegrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive\nreasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the\ngeneration of visual latents.

It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object\nrepresentations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in\nmemory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While\nprior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)\nexplicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability\nnaturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they\ncould: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for\ndownstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic\nnature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two\npatches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode\nIsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,\nwhich reaches over 90% accuracy.

Despite its notable success\nin large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion\nTransformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to\nfundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are\nsemantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens\nexhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert\nspecialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework\nfeaturing a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert\nspecialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition\nimage tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing\naccording to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional\nimage tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on\nsemantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent\nspace enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for\nincorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is\ncrucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss\nthat explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting\nintra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on\nImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods\nunder both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be\nmade publicly available."}

At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an\niterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates\ntwo key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep\nShifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to\nhigh-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while\nrequiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an\nasynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within\na single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.\nExtensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks\ndemonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and\nachieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion\nmethods.

In camera-guided video generation\nwith a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with\nthe generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address\nthis, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire\nsequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of\nthe predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm\nthat extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video\ngeneration. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained\nmodel, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with\nDiffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show\nalready provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce\nOmni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching\nby conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed\nloop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS\nachieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,\nframe-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera\npaths, including Oscar Reutersv\\\"ard's Impossible Staircase.

To address these issues, we\npropose ERTACache, a principled caching framework that jointly rectifies both\nerror types.

In\ncontrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's\nbody shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned\non that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose\nprior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides\nthe pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose\nprior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D\nconstraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose\naccuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often\noverlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,\nrequiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile\nplug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose\nestimators to enhance their performance.

To address\nthis critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework\nfor generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D\nfingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D\nstyle transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale\nimages mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D\nStructure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D\nanatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that\nrenders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other\nimaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale\nsynthetic dataset of 420,000 samples.

We propose to use the Kernel Density\nEstimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised\nvideo transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of\nthe data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task\ndata, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture\nnew knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of\ntransfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge\ntransfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology\nsubstantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning\nmany tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action\nrecognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2,\nwithout using any labels or class boundaries."}

GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been\nspecifically marketed towards oncology use.\n  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the\nACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300\nmultiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation\noncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment\nindications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate\nconcise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated\ncorrectness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was\nquantified using Fleiss' \\k{appa}.\n  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,\noutperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were\nmost pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's\ntreatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%\nCI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).\nHallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their\npresence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \\k{appa} 0.083 for\ncorrectness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors\nclustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed\nclinical adaptation.\n  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation\noncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable\nperformance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment\nrecommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.\nWhile hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors\nunderscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert\noversight before clinical implementation."}

Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified\nstructural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level\ntext memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text\nextractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input\nimages. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves\ncomplete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,\nwe employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for\nconstructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These\nthree complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images\nthat are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple\nlevels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and\nlogical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving\nindustrial and medical domains.

As such\nour model addresses simultaneously the tasks of promptable video object\nsegmentation, referring expression segmentation, and object captioning.

Specifically, given an input image, the model\nmust first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify\nthe participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),\nand finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).\nExisting methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we\nshow through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address\nthe inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories\nmay reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key\ncontributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb\nclassification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous\nsemantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of\nfully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to\nreformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning\n(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a\ncomprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully\ndesigned to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To\naddress the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb\nMultilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to\ncapture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision\nboundaries.

Beyond standard spatial and visual question-answering (QA) tasks\non current autonomous driving benchmarks, driving knowledge tests require a\ncomplete understanding of all traffic rules, signage, and right-of-way\nprinciples. To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases\nthat rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an\nextensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers\ntraffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we\nshow that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on\nbasic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning\nand complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial\nlayouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple\ncategories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection\ndecision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into\nmodel sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,\ndistance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances\ndownstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world\ndatasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can\ninternalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively\nacross downstream QA tasks."}

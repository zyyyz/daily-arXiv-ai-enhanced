This paper uses\nfrequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of\ndistinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a\ntwo-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform\nimages into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become\ndetectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to\ndifferentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that\nthe frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,\nsignificantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain\nimages.

Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of\nmovable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.\n6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,\nbut 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle\nvary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes\nits 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not\nnecessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the\nactual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for\ncategory-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a\nsingle RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and\nrotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the\nrotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body\nframe. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained\nbicycle pose state and travel direction.

Daily tasks such as handling\nmoney without relying on someone can be troublesome for them. For that purpose\nthis paper presents a real-time currency detection system designed to assist\nvisually impaired individuals. The proposed model is trained on a dataset\ncontaining 30 classes of notes and coins, representing 3 types of currency: US\ndollar (USD), Euro (EUR), and Bangladeshi taka (BDT). Our approach uses a\nYOLOv8 nano model with a custom detection head featuring deep convolutional\nlayers and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to enhance feature extraction and\ndetection accuracy. Our model has achieved a higher accuracy of 97.73%, recall\nof 95.23%, f1-score of 95.85% and a mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5\n(mAP50(B)) of 97.21\\%. Using the voice feedback after the detection would help\nthe visually impaired to identify the currency. This paper aims to create a\npractical and efficient currency detection system to empower visually impaired\nindividuals independent in handling money."}

However, these works merely incorporate text features into\nvideo snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of\nredundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we\npropose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further\nrefine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and\nwe propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).\nSpecifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video\nsnippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the\ncaptions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual\nfeatures of highlighted portions.

While these range image representations enable\nefficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental\ngeometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,\ncompromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR\nIntrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,\nsensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from\nspinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or\ncalibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic\ngeometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters\nincluding laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam\ncalibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud\nreconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the\ncomplete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect\npoint preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric\naccuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing\ngeometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a\ncompression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,\ndemonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This\nparadigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new\npossibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete\ngeometric preservation."}

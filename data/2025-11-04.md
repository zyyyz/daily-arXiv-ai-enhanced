Abstract: Recent success with large language models has sparked a new wave of verbal
human-AI interaction. While such models support users in a variety of creative
tasks, they lack the embodied nature of human interaction. Dance, as a primal
form of human expression, is predestined to complement this experience. To
explore creative human-AI interaction exemplified by dance, we build an
interactive model based on motion capture (MoCap) data. It generates an
artificial other by partially mimicking and also "creatively" enhancing an
incoming sequence of movement data. It is the first model, which leverages
single-person motion data and high level features in order to do so and, thus,
it does not rely on low level human-human interaction data. It combines ideas
of two diffusion models, motion inpainting, and motion style transfer to
generate movement representations that are both temporally coherent and
responsive to a chosen movement reference. The success of the model is
demonstrated by quantitatively assessing the convergence of the feature
distribution of the generated samples and the test set which serves as
simulating the human performer. We show that our generations are first steps to
creative dancing with AI as they are both diverse showing various deviations
from the human partner while appearing realistic.

Abstract: Coral reefs support numerous marine organisms and are an important source of
coastal protection from storms and floods, representing a major part of marine
ecosystems. However coral reefs face increasing threats from pollution, ocean
acidification, and sea temperature anomalies, making efficient protection and
monitoring heavily urgent. Therefore, this study presents a novel
machine-learning-based coral bleaching classification system based on a diverse
global dataset with samples of healthy and bleached corals under varying
environmental conditions, including deep seas, marshes, and coastal zones. We
benchmarked and compared three state-of-the-art models: Residual Neural Network
(ResNet), Vision Transformer (ViT), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
After comprehensive hyperparameter tuning, the CNN model achieved the highest
accuracy of 88%, outperforming existing benchmarks. Our findings offer
important insights into autonomous coral monitoring and present a comprehensive
analysis of the most widely used computer vision models.

Abstract: Coral reef monitoring in the Western Indian Ocean is limited by the labor
demands of underwater visual censuses. This work evaluates a YOLOv8-based deep
learning pipeline for automating family-level fish identification from video
transects collected in Kenya and Tanzania. A curated dataset of 24 families was
tested under different configurations, providing the first region-specific
benchmark for automated reef fish monitoring in the Western Indian Ocean. The
best model achieved mAP@0.5 of 0.52, with high accuracy for abundant families
but weaker detection of rare or complex taxa. Results demonstrate the potential
of deep learning as a scalable complement to traditional monitoring methods.

Abstract: Representation learning methods utilizing the InfoNCE loss have demonstrated
considerable capacity in reducing human annotation effort by training invariant
neural feature extractors. Although different variants of the training
objective adhere to the information maximization principle between the data and
learned features, data selection and augmentation still rely on human
hypotheses or engineering, which may be suboptimal. For instance, data
augmentation in contrastive learning primarily focuses on color jittering,
aiming to emulate real-world illumination changes. In this work, we investigate
the potential of selecting training data based on their mutual information
computed from real-world distributions, which, in principle, should endow the
learned features with better generalization when applied in open environments.
Specifically, we consider patches attached to scenes that exhibit high mutual
information under natural perturbations, such as color changes and motion, as
positive samples for learning with contrastive loss. We evaluate the proposed
mutual-information-informed data augmentation method on several benchmarks
across multiple state-of-the-art representation learning frameworks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and establishing it as a promising direction
for future research.

Abstract: Digital image processing involves the systematic handling of images using
advanced computer algorithms, and has gained significant attention in both
academic and practical fields. Image enhancement is a crucial preprocessing
stage in the image-processing chain, improving image quality and emphasizing
features. This makes subsequent tasks (segmentation, feature extraction,
classification) more reliable. Image enhancement is essential for rice leaf
analysis, aiding in disease detection, nutrient deficiency evaluation, and
growth analysis. Denoising followed by contrast enhancement are the primary
steps. Image filters, generally employed for denoising, transform or enhance
visual characteristics like brightness, contrast, and sharpness, playing a
crucial role in improving overall image quality and enabling the extraction of
useful information. This work provides an extensive comparative study of
well-known image-denoising methods combined with CLAHE (Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for efficient denoising of rice leaf images.
The experiments were performed on a rice leaf image dataset to ensure the data
is relevant and representative. Results were examined using various metrics to
comprehensively test enhancement methods. This approach provides a strong basis
for assessing the effectiveness of methodologies in digital image processing
and reveals insights useful for future adaptation in agricultural research and
other domains.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: LiDAR-based roadside perception is a cornerstone of advanced Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS). While considerable research has addressed optimal
LiDAR placement for infrastructure, the profound impact of differing LiDAR
scanning patterns on perceptual performance remains comparatively
under-investigated. The inherent nature of various scanning modes - such as
traditional repetitive (mechanical/solid-state) versus emerging non-repetitive
(e.g. prism-based) systems - leads to distinct point cloud distributions at
varying distances, critically dictating the efficacy of object detection and
overall environmental understanding. To systematically investigate these
differences in infrastructure-based contexts, we introduce the "InfraLiDARs'
Benchmark," a novel dataset meticulously collected in the CARLA simulation
environment using concurrently operating infrastructure-based LiDARs exhibiting
both scanning paradigms. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive
statistical analysis of the respective LiDAR scanning abilities and evaluate
the impact of these distinct patterns on the performance of various leading 3D
object detection algorithms. Our findings reveal that non-repetitive scanning
LiDAR and the 128-line repetitive LiDAR were found to exhibit comparable
detection performance across various scenarios. Despite non-repetitive LiDAR's
limited perception range, it's a cost-effective option considering its low
price. Ultimately, this study provides insights for setting up roadside
perception system with optimal LiDAR scanning patterns and compatible
algorithms for diverse roadside applications, and publicly releases the
"InfraLiDARs' Benchmark" dataset to foster further research.

Abstract: We introduce [Cosmos-Predict2.5], the latest generation of the Cosmos World
Foundation Models for Physical AI. Built on a flow-based architecture,
[Cosmos-Predict2.5] unifies Text2World, Image2World, and Video2World generation
in a single model and leverages [Cosmos-Reason1], a Physical AI vision-language
model, to provide richer text grounding and finer control of world simulation.
Trained on 200M curated video clips and refined with reinforcement
learning-based post-training, [Cosmos-Predict2.5] achieves substantial
improvements over [Cosmos-Predict1] in video quality and instruction alignment,
with models released at 2B and 14B scales. These capabilities enable more
reliable synthetic data generation, policy evaluation, and closed-loop
simulation for robotics and autonomous systems. We further extend the family
with [Cosmos-Transfer2.5], a control-net style framework for Sim2Real and
Real2Real world translation. Despite being 3.5$\times$ smaller than
[Cosmos-Transfer1], it delivers higher fidelity and robust long-horizon video
generation. Together, these advances establish [Cosmos-Predict2.5] and
[Cosmos-Transfer2.5] as versatile tools for scaling embodied intelligence. To
accelerate research and deployment in Physical AI, we release source code,
pretrained checkpoints, and curated benchmarks under the NVIDIA Open Model
License at https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-predict2.5 and
https://github.com/nvidia-cosmos/cosmos-transfer2.5. We hope these open
resources lower the barrier to adoption and foster innovation in building the
next generation of embodied intelligence.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Rapid climate change and other disturbances in alpine ecosystems demand
frequent habitat monitoring, yet manual mapping remains prohibitively expensive
for the required temporal resolution. We employ deep learning for change
detection using long-term alpine habitat data from Gesaeuse National Park,
Austria, addressing a major gap in applying geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
to complex natural environments with fuzzy class boundaries and highly
imbalanced classes. We compare two paradigms: post-classification change
detection (CD) versus direct CD. For post-classification CD, we evaluate GFMs
Prithvi-EO-2.0 and Clay v1.0 against U-Net CNNs; for direct CD, we test the
transformer ChangeViT against U-Net baselines. Using high-resolution multimodal
data (RGB, NIR, LiDAR, terrain attributes) covering 4,480 documented changes
over 15.3 km2, results show Clay v1.0 achieves 51% overall accuracy versus
U-Net's 41% for multi-class habitat change, while both reach 67% for binary
change detection. Direct CD yields superior IoU (0.53 vs 0.35) for binary but
only 28% accuracy for multi-class detection. Cross-temporal evaluation reveals
GFM robustness, with Clay maintaining 33% accuracy on 2020 data versus U-Net's
23%. Integrating LiDAR improves semantic segmentation from 30% to 50% accuracy.
Although overall accuracies are lower than in more homogeneous landscapes, they
reflect realistic performance for complex alpine habitats. Future work will
integrate object-based post-processing and physical constraints to enhance
applicability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present LeMiCa, a training-free and efficient acceleration framework for
diffusion-based video generation. While existing caching strategies primarily
focus on reducing local heuristic errors, they often overlook the accumulation
of global errors, leading to noticeable content degradation between accelerated
and original videos. To address this issue, we formulate cache scheduling as a
directed graph with error-weighted edges and introduce a Lexicographic Minimax
Path Optimization strategy that explicitly bounds the worst-case path error.
This approach substantially improves the consistency of global content and
style across generated frames. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-video
benchmarks demonstrate that LeMiCa delivers dual improvements in both inference
speed and generation quality. Notably, our method achieves a 2.9x speedup on
the Latte model and reaches an LPIPS score of 0.05 on Open-Sora, outperforming
prior caching techniques. Importantly, these gains come with minimal perceptual
quality degradation, making LeMiCa a robust and generalizable paradigm for
accelerating diffusion-based video generation. We believe this approach can
serve as a strong foundation for future research on efficient and reliable
video synthesis. Our code is available at :https://github.com/UnicomAI/LeMiCa

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has become the de facto post-training strategy
for large vision-language-action (VLA) models, but its reliance on costly human
demonstrations limits scalability and generalization. We propose Probe, Learn,
Distill (PLD), a three-stage plug-and-play framework that improves VLAs through
residual reinforcement learning (RL) and distribution-aware data collection. In
Stage 1, we train lightweight residual actors to probe failure regions of the
VLA generalist. In Stage 2, we use a hybrid rollout scheme that aligns
collected trajectories with the generalist's deployment distribution while
capturing recovery behaviors. In Stage 3, we distill the curated trajectories
back into the generalist with standard SFT. PLD achieves near-saturated 99%
task success on LIBERO, over 50% gains in SimplerEnv, and 100% success on
real-world Franka and YAM arm manipulation tasks. Ablations show that residual
probing and distribution-aware replay are key to collecting deployment-aligned
data that improves both seen and unseen tasks, offering a scalable path toward
self-improving VLA models.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The anatomical structure segmentation of the spine and adjacent structures
from computed tomography (CT) images is a key step for spinal disease diagnosis
and treatment. However, the segmentation of CT images is impeded by low
contrast and complex vertebral boundaries. Although advanced models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown promise in various segmentation tasks,
their performance in spinal CT imaging is limited by high annotation
requirements and poor domain adaptability. To address these limitations, we
propose SpinalSAM-R1, a multimodal vision-language interactive system that
integrates a fine-tuned SAM with DeepSeek-R1, for spine CT image segmentation.
Specifically, our SpinalSAM-R1 introduces an anatomy-guided attention mechanism
to improve spine segmentation performance, and a semantics-driven interaction
protocol powered by DeepSeek-R1, enabling natural language-guided refinement.
The SpinalSAM-R1 is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient
adaptation. We validate our SpinalSAM-R1 on the spine anatomical structure with
CT images. Experimental results suggest that our method achieves superior
segmentation performance. Meanwhile, we develop a PyQt5-based interactive
software, which supports point, box, and text-based prompts. The system
supports 11 clinical operations with 94.3\% parsing accuracy and sub-800 ms
response times. The software is released on

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is a non-invasive, real-time imaging
modality that can be used for in-situ, in-vivo imaging and the microstructural
analysis of mucous structures. The diagnosis using CLE is, however, complicated
by images being hard to interpret for non-experienced physicians. Utilizing
machine learning as an augmentative tool would hence be beneficial, but is
complicated by the shortage of histopathology-correlated CLE imaging sequences
with respect to the plurality of patterns in this domain, leading to
overfitting of machine learning models. To overcome this, self-supervised
learning (SSL) can be employed on larger unlabeled datasets. CLE is a
video-based modality with high inter-frame correlation, leading to a
non-stratified data distribution for SSL training. In this work, we propose a
filter functionality on CLE video sequences to reduce the dataset redundancy in
SSL training and improve SSL training convergence and training efficiency. We
use four state-of-the-art baseline networks and a SSL teacher-student network
with a vision transformer small backbone for the evaluation. These networks
were evaluated on downstream tasks for a sinonasal tumor dataset and a squamous
cell carcinoma of the skin dataset. On both datasets, we found the highest test
accuracy on the filtered SSL-pretrained model, with 67.48% and 73.52%, both
considerably outperforming their non-SSL baselines. Our results show that SSL
is an effective method for CLE pretraining. Further, we show that our proposed
CLE video filter can be utilized to improve training efficiency in
self-supervised scenarios, resulting in a reduction of 67% in training time.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become state-of-the-art generative models for images,
audio, and video, yet enabling fine-grained controllable generation, i.e.,
continuously steering specific concepts without disturbing unrelated content,
remains challenging. Concept Sliders (CS) offer a promising direction by
discovering semantic directions through textual contrasts, but they require
per-concept training and architecture-specific fine-tuning (e.g., LoRA),
limiting scalability to new modalities. In this work we introduce FreeSliders,
a simple yet effective approach that is fully training-free and
modality-agnostic, achieved by partially estimating the CS formula during
inference. To support modality-agnostic evaluation, we extend the CS benchmark
to include both video and audio, establishing the first suite for fine-grained
concept generation control with multiple modalities. We further propose three
evaluation properties along with new metrics to improve evaluation quality.
Finally, we identify an open problem of scale selection and non-linear
traversals and introduce a two-stage procedure that automatically detects
saturation points and reparameterizes traversal for perceptually uniform,
semantically meaningful edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method enables plug-and-play, training-free concept control across modalities,
improves over existing baselines, and establishes new tools for principled
controllable generation. An interactive presentation of our benchmark and
method is available at: https://azencot-group.github.io/FreeSliders/

Abstract: Text to video generation has emerged as a critical frontier in generative

novel hierarchical framework that integrates compositional scene understanding

Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a Compositional Scene Parser

temporal annotations, (2) a Temporal-Spatial Attention Mechanism (TSAM) that
ensures coherent motion dynamics across frames while preserving spatial
details, and (3) a Progressive Video Refinement (PVR) module that iteratively
enhances video quality through multi-scale temporal reasoning. Extensive
experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that MOVAI achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving video quality metrics by 15.3% in
LPIPS, 12.7% in FVD, and 18.9% in user preference studies compared to existing
methods. Our framework shows particular strength in generating complex
multi-object scenes with realistic temporal dynamics and fine-grained semantic

Abstract: We propose a novel cognitively-inspired method to improve and interpret
physical simulation in vision-language models. Our ``Chain of Time" method
involves generating a series of intermediate images during a simulation, and it
is motivated by in-context reasoning in machine learning, as well as mental
simulation in humans. Chain of Time is used at inference time, and requires no
additional fine-tuning. We apply the Chain-of-Time method to synthetic and
real-world domains, including 2-D graphics simulations and natural 3-D videos.
These domains test a variety of particular physical properties, including
velocity, acceleration, fluid dynamics, and conservation of momentum. We found
that using Chain-of-Time simulation substantially improves the performance of a
state-of-the-art image generation model. Beyond examining performance, we also
analyzed the specific states of the world simulated by an image model at each
time step, which sheds light on the dynamics underlying these simulations. This
analysis reveals insights that are hidden from traditional evaluations of
physical reasoning, including cases where an image generation model is able to
simulate physical properties that unfold over time, such as velocity, gravity,
and collisions. Our analysis also highlights particular cases where the image
generation model struggles to infer particular physical parameters from input
images, despite being capable of simulating relevant physical processes.

Abstract: Cardiac ultrasound (US) is among the most widely used diagnostic tools in
cardiology for assessing heart health, but its effectiveness is limited by
operator dependence, time constraints, and human error. The shortage of trained
professionals, especially in remote areas, further restricts access. These
issues underscore the need for automated solutions that can ensure consistent,
and accessible cardiac imaging regardless of operator skill or location. Recent
progress in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), has gained attention for enabling autonomous decision-making.
However, existing DRL-based approaches to cardiac US scanning lack
reproducibility, rely on proprietary data, and use simplified models. Motivated
by these gaps, we present the first end-to-end framework that integrates
generative AI and DRL to enable autonomous and reproducible cardiac US
scanning. The framework comprises two components: (i) a conditional generative
simulator combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs), that models the cardiac US environment producing realistic
action-conditioned images; and (ii) a DRL module that leverages this simulator
to learn autonomous, accurate scanning policies. The proposed framework
delivers AI-driven guidance through expert-validated models that classify image
type and assess quality, supports conditional generation of realistic US
images, and establishes a reproducible foundation extendable to other organs.
To ensure reproducibility, a publicly available dataset of real cardiac US
scans is released. The solution is validated through several experiments. The
VAE-GAN is benchmarked against existing GAN variants, with performance assessed
using qualitative and quantitative approaches, while the DRL-based scanning
system is evaluated under varying configurations to demonstrate effectiveness.

Abstract: The primary challenge in computer vision is precisely calculating the pose of

generalizing from synthetic data to real-world situations with fluctuating
lighting, textureless objects, and significant occlusions. To address these
limitations, VLM6D, a novel dual-stream architecture that leverages the
distinct strengths of visual and geometric data from RGB-D input for robust and
precise pose estimation. Our framework uniquely integrates two specialized
encoders: a powerful, self-supervised Vision Transformer (DINOv2) processes the
RGB modality, harnessing its rich, pre-trained understanding of visual grammar
to achieve remarkable resilience against texture and lighting variations.
Concurrently, a PointNet++ encoder processes the 3D point cloud derived from
depth data, enabling robust geometric reasoning that excels even with the
sparse, fragmented data typical of severe occlusion. These complementary
feature streams are effectively fused to inform a multi task prediction head.
We demonstrate through comprehensive experiments that VLM6D obtained new SOTA
performance on the challenging Occluded-LineMOD, validating its superior
robustness and accuracy.

estimation datasets, including MORPH II, CACD, and AFAD, and achieved superior
performance in terms of mean absolute error (MAE). To address computational
constraints, we leverage pre-trained models and systematically explore
different configurations, using linear layers and advanced regularization
techniques to optimize the architecture. Comprehensive ablation studies
highlight the critical role of individual components and training strategies,
and in particular emphasize the importance of adapted attention mechanisms
within the CNN framework to improve the model focus on age-relevant facial
features. The results show that the ConvNeXt-ViT hybrid not only outperforms
traditional methods, but also provides a robust foundation for future advances
in age estimation and related visual tasks. This work underscores the
transformative potential of hybrid architectures and represents a promising
direction for the seamless integration of CNNs and transformers to address
complex computer vision challenges.

Abstract: Recent studies in long video understanding have harnessed the advanced
visual-language reasoning capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs),
driving the evolution of video-LMMs specialized for processing extended video
sequences. However, the scalability of these models is severely limited by the
overwhelming volume of visual tokens generated from extended video sequences.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes FLoC, an efficient visual token
compression framework based on the facility location function, a principled
approach that swiftly selects a compact yet highly representative and diverse
subset of visual tokens within a predefined budget on the number of visual
tokens. By integrating the lazy greedy algorithm, our method achieves
remarkable efficiency gains by swiftly selecting a compact subset of tokens,
drastically reducing the number of visual tokens while guaranteeing
near-optimal performance. Notably, our approach is training-free,
model-agnostic, and query-agnostic, providing a versatile solution that
seamlessly integrates with diverse video-LLMs and existing workflows. Extensive
evaluations on large-scale benchmarks, such as Video-MME, MLVU, and
LongVideoBench, demonstrate that our framework consistently surpasses recent
compression techniques, highlighting not only its effectiveness and robustness
in addressing the critical challenges of long video understanding, but also its
efficiency in processing speed.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image models have increased the exposure of
powerful image editing techniques as a tool, raising concerns about their
potential for malicious use. An emerging line of research to address such
threats focuses on implanting "protective" adversarial noise into images before
their public release, so future attempts to edit them using text-to-image
models can be impeded. However, subsequent works have shown that these
adversarial noises are often easily "reversed," e.g., with techniques as simple
as JPEG compression, casting doubt on the practicality of the approach. In this
paper, we argue that adversarial noise for image protection should not only be
imperceptible, as has been a primary focus of prior work, but also
irreversible, viz., it should be difficult to detect as noise provided that the
original image is hidden. We propose a surprisingly simple method to enhance
the robustness of image protection methods against noise reversal techniques.
Specifically, it applies an adaptive per-region Gaussian blur on the noise to
adjust the overall frequency spectrum. Through extensive experiments, we show
that our method consistently improves the per-sample worst-case protection
performance of existing methods against a wide range of reversal techniques on
diverse image editing scenarios, while also reducing quality degradation due to
noise in terms of perceptual metrics. Code is available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual compliance verification is a critical yet underexplored problem in
computer vision, especially in domains such as media, entertainment, and
advertising where content must adhere to complex and evolving policy rules.
Existing methods often rely on task-specific deep learning models trained on
manually labeled datasets, which are costly to build and limited in
generalizability. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) offer
broad real-world knowledge and policy understanding, they struggle to reason
over fine-grained visual details and apply structured compliance rules
effectively on their own. In this paper, we propose CompAgent, the first
agentic framework for visual compliance verification. CompAgent augments MLLMs
with a suite of visual tools - such as object detectors, face analyzers, NSFW
detectors, and captioning models - and introduces a planning agent that
dynamically selects appropriate tools based on the compliance policy. A
verification agent then integrates image, tool outputs, and policy context to
perform multi-modal reasoning. Experiments on public benchmarks show that
CompAgent outperforms specialized classifiers, direct MLLM prompting, and
curated routing baselines, achieving up to 76% F1 score and a 10% improvement
over the state-of-the-art on the UnsafeBench dataset. Our results demonstrate
the effectiveness of agentic planning and tool-augmented reasoning for
scalable, accurate, and adaptable visual compliance verification.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid evolution of AI-generated images poses unprecedented challenges to
information integrity and media authenticity. Existing detection approaches
suffer from fundamental limitations: traditional classifiers lack
interpretability and fail to generalize across evolving generative models,
while vision-language models (VLMs), despite their promise, remain constrained
to single-shot analysis and pixel-level reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce AIFo (Agent-based Image Forensics), a novel training-free
framework that emulates human forensic investigation through multi-agent
collaboration. Unlike conventional methods, our framework employs a set of
forensic tools, including reverse image search, metadata extraction,
pre-trained classifiers, and VLM analysis, coordinated by specialized LLM-based
agents that collect, synthesize, and reason over cross-source evidence. When
evidence is conflicting or insufficient, a structured multi-agent debate
mechanism allows agents to exchange arguments and reach a reliable conclusion.
Furthermore, we enhance the framework with a memory-augmented reasoning module
that learns from historical cases to improve future detection accuracy. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans 6,000 images across both controlled laboratory
settings and challenging real-world scenarios, including images from modern
generative platforms and diverse online sources. AIFo achieves 97.05% accuracy,
substantially outperforming traditional classifiers and state-of-the-art VLMs.
These results demonstrate that agent-based procedural reasoning offers a new
paradigm for more robust, interpretable, and adaptable AI-generated image
detection.

Abstract: The vision community is undergoing the unprecedented progress with the
emergence of Vision-Language Pretraining Models (VLMs). Prompt learning plays
as the holy grail of accessing VLMs since it enables their fast adaptation to
downstream tasks with limited resources. Whereas existing researches milling
around single-prompt paradigms, rarely investigate the technical potential
behind their multi-prompt learning counterparts. This paper aims to provide a
principled retrospect for vision-language multi-prompt learning. We extend the
recent constant modality gap phenomenon to learnable prompts and then, justify
the superiority of vision-language transfer with multi-prompt augmentation,
empirically and theoretically. In terms of this observation, we propose an
Energy-based Multi-prompt Learning (EMPL) to generate multiple prompt
embeddings by drawing instances from an energy-based distribution, which is
implicitly defined by VLMs. So our EMPL is not only parameter-efficient but
also rigorously lead to the balance between in-domain and out-of-domain
open-vocabulary generalization. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted
to justify our claims and the excellence of EMPL.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of satellite Internet with low-Earth-orbit (LEO)
satellites in mega-constellations allows ubiquitous connectivity to rural and
remote areas. However, weather events have a significant impact on the
performance and reliability of satellite Internet. Adverse weather events such
as snow and rain can disturb the performance and operations of satellite
Internet's essential ground terminal components, such as satellite antennas,
significantly disrupting the space-ground link conditions between LEO
satellites and ground stations. This challenge calls for not only region-based
weather forecasts but also fine-grained detection capability on ground terminal
components of fine-grained weather conditions. Such a capability can assist in
fault diagnostics and mitigation for reliable satellite Internet, but its
solutions are lacking, not to mention the effectiveness and generalization that
are essential in real-world deployments. This paper discusses an efficient
transfer learning (TL) method that can enable a ground component to locally
detect representative weather-related conditions. The proposed method can
detect snow, wet, and other conditions resulting from adverse and typical
weather events and shows superior performance compared to the typical deep
learning methods, such as YOLOv7, YOLOv9, Faster R-CNN, and R-YOLO. Our TL
method also shows the advantage of being generalizable to various scenarios.

Abstract: Cell segmentation in single-shot quantitative phase microscopy (ssQPM) faces
challenges from traditional thresholding methods that are sensitive to noise
and cell density, while deep learning approaches using simple channel
concatenation fail to exploit the complementary nature of polarized intensity
images and phase maps. We introduce DM-QPMNet, a dual-encoder network that
treats these as distinct modalities with separate encoding streams. Our
architecture fuses modality-specific features at intermediate depth via
multi-head attention, enabling polarized edge and texture representations to
selectively integrate complementary phase information. This content-aware
fusion preserves training stability while adding principled multi-modal
integration through dual-source skip connections and per-modality normalization
at minimal overhead. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements over
monolithic concatenation and single-modality baselines, showing that
modality-specific encoding with learnable fusion effectively exploits ssQPM's
simultaneous capture of complementary illumination and phase cues for robust
cell segmentation.

Abstract: The optimal transport (OT) problem aims to find the most efficient mapping
between two probability distributions under a given cost function, and has
diverse applications in many fields such as machine learning, computer vision
and computer graphics. However, existing methods for computing optimal
transport maps are primarily developed for Euclidean spaces and the sphere. In
this paper, we explore the problem of computing the optimal transport map in
hyperbolic space, which naturally arises in contexts involving hierarchical
data, networks, and multi-genus Riemann surfaces. We propose a novel and
efficient algorithm for computing the optimal transport map in hyperbolic space
using a geometric variational technique by extending methods for Euclidean and
spherical geometry to the hyperbolic setting. We also perform experiments on
synthetic data and multi-genus surface models to validate the efficacy of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have enabled the generation of
high-quality videos. However, these videos still suffer from unrealistic
deformations, semantic violations, and physical inconsistencies that are
largely rooted in the absence of 3D physical priors. To address these
challenges, we propose an object-aware 4D human motion generation framework
grounded in 3D Gaussian representations and motion diffusion priors. With
pre-generated 3D humans and objects, our method, Motion Score Distilled
Interaction (MSDI), employs the spatial and prompt semantic information in
large language models (LLMs) and motion priors through the proposed Motion
Diffusion Score Distillation Sampling (MSDS). The combination of MSDS and LLMs
enables our spatial-aware motion optimization, which distills score gradients
from pre-trained motion diffusion models, to refine human motion while
respecting object and semantic constraints. Unlike prior methods requiring
joint training on limited interaction datasets, our zero-shot approach avoids
retraining and generalizes to out-of-distribution object aware human motions.
Experiments demonstrate that our framework produces natural and physically
plausible human motions that respect 3D spatial context, offering a scalable
solution for realistic 4D generation.

Abstract: In the single-positive multi-label (SPML) setting, each image in a dataset is
labeled with the presence of a single class, while the true presence of other
classes remains unknown. The challenge is to narrow the performance gap between
this partially-labeled setting and fully-supervised learning, which often
requires a significant annotation budget. Prior SPML methods were developed and
benchmarked on synthetic datasets created by randomly sampling single positive
labels from fully-annotated datasets like Pascal VOC, COCO, NUS-WIDE, and
CUB200. However, this synthetic approach does not reflect real-world scenarios
and fails to capture the fine-grained complexities that can lead to difficult
misclassifications. In this work, we introduce the L48 dataset, a fine-grained,
real-world multi-label dataset derived from recordings of bird sounds. L48
provides a natural SPML setting with single-positive annotations on a
challenging, fine-grained domain, as well as two extended settings in which
domain priors give access to additional negative labels. We benchmark existing
SPML methods on L48 and observe significant performance differences compared to
synthetic datasets and analyze method weaknesses, underscoring the need for
more realistic and difficult benchmarks.

Abstract: In entomology and ecology research, biologists often need to collect a large
number of insects, among which beetles are the most common species. A common
practice for biologists to organize beetles is to place them on trays and take
a picture of each tray. Given the images of thousands of such trays, it is
important to have an automated pipeline to process the large-scale data for
further research. Therefore, we develop a 3-stage pipeline to detect all the
beetles on each tray, sort and crop the image of each beetle, and do
morphological segmentation on the cropped beetles. For detection, we design an
iterative process utilizing a transformer-based open-vocabulary object detector
and a vision-language model. For segmentation, we manually labeled 670 beetle
images and fine-tuned two variants of a transformer-based segmentation model to
achieve fine-grained segmentation of beetles with relatively high accuracy. The
pipeline integrates multiple deep learning methods and is specialized for
beetle image processing, which can greatly improve the efficiency to process
large-scale beetle data and accelerate biological research.

Abstract: Accurate 3D point cloud registration underpins reliable image-guided
colonoscopy, directly affecting lesion localization, margin assessment, and
navigation safety. However, biological tissue exhibits repetitive textures and
locally homogeneous geometry that cause feature degeneracy, while substantial
domain shifts between pre-operative anatomy and intra-operative observations
further degrade alignment stability. To address these clinically critical
challenges, we introduce a novel 3D registration method tailored for endoscopic
navigation and a high-quality, clinically grounded dataset to support rigorous
and reproducible benchmarking. We introduce C3VD-Raycasting-10k, a large-scale
benchmark dataset with 10,014 geometrically aligned point cloud pairs derived
from clinical CT data. We propose MambaNetLK, a novel correspondence-free
registration framework, which enhances the PointNetLK architecture by
integrating a Mamba State Space Model (SSM) as a cross-modal feature extractor.
As a result, the proposed framework efficiently captures long-range
dependencies with linear-time complexity. The alignment is achieved iteratively
using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm. On the clinical dataset, C3VD-Raycasting-10k,
MambaNetLK achieves the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art
methods, reducing median rotation error by 56.04% and RMSE translation error by
26.19% over the second-best method. The model also demonstrates strong
generalization on ModelNet40 and superior robustness to initial pose
perturbations. MambaNetLK provides a robust foundation for 3D registration in
surgical navigation. The combination of a globally expressive SSM-based feature
extractor and a large-scale clinical dataset enables more accurate and reliable
guidance systems in minimally invasive procedures like colonoscopy.

Abstract: Humans excel at visual social inference, the ability to infer hidden elements

critical for developing more human-like AI agents. We introduce Spot The Ball,
a challenging benchmark for evaluating visual social inference in
vision-language models (VLMs) using sports as a test domain. The task is to
localize a removed sports ball from soccer, basketball, and volleyball images.
We present a curated evaluation set with human baselines and a scalable
pipeline for generating additional test items. We evaluate four
state-of-the-art VLMs (Gemini, GPT, LLaMA, Qwen) using three prompting
strategies, finding that humans are consistently two to three times more
accurate (20-34%) than models ($\leq$ 17%) across all sports. Our analyses show
that models rely on superficial spatial heuristics--such as guessing near the
image center or nearby players--while humans leverage social cues like gaze
direction and body pose. These findings reveal a persistent human-model gap in
visual social reasoning and underscore the need for architectures that
explicitly encode structured behavioral cues to achieve robust, human-like
inference.

Abstract: Accurate classification plays a pivotal role in smart agriculture, enabling

However, conventional centralized training often requires large-scale data
collection, which raises privacy concerns, while standard federated learning
struggles with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data and
incurs high communication costs. To address these challenges, we propose a
federated learning framework that integrates a frozen Contrastive
Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) vision transformer (ViT) with a lightweight
transformer classifier. By leveraging the strong feature extraction capability
of the pre-trained CLIP ViT, the framework avoids training large-scale models
from scratch and restricts federated updates to a compact classifier, thereby
reducing transmission overhead significantly. Furthermore, to mitigate
performance degradation caused by non-IID data distribution, a small subset
(1%) of CLIP-extracted feature representations from all classes is shared
across clients. These shared features are non-reversible to raw images,
ensuring privacy preservation while aligning class representation across
participants. Experimental results on agricultural classification tasks show
that the proposed method achieve 86.6% accuracy, which is more than 4 times
higher compared to baseline federated learning approaches. This demonstrates
the effectiveness and efficiency of combining vision-language model features
with federated learning for privacy-preserving and scalable agricultural
intelligence.

of the in-context learning ability of the pre-trained diffusion transformer.
Second, we preserve the original generative ability of the pretrained model
with a new Semantic Correspondence Alignment Loss. We evaluate the multi-view
consistency, text alignment, identity similarity, and visual quality of
PersonalView and compare it to recent baselines with potential capability of
multi-view customization. PersonalView significantly outperforms baselines
trained on a large corpus of multi-view data with only 100 training samples.

Abstract: Petrography is a branch of geology that analyzes the mineralogical

for understanding rock properties across geology, archaeology, engineering,
mineral exploration, and the oil industry. However, petrography is a
labor-intensive task requiring experts to conduct detailed visual examinations
of thin section samples through optical polarization microscopes, thus
hampering scalability and highlighting the need for automated techniques. To
address this challenge, we introduce the Large-scale Imaging and Thin section
Optical-polarization Set (LITHOS), the largest and most diverse publicly
available experimental framework for automated petrography. LITHOS includes
211,604 high-resolution RGB patches of polarized light and 105,802
expert-annotated grains across 25 mineral categories. Each annotation consists
of the mineral class, spatial coordinates, and expert-defined major and minor
axes represented as intersecting vector paths, capturing grain geometry and
orientation. We evaluate multiple deep learning techniques for mineral
classification in LITHOS and propose a dual-encoder transformer architecture
that integrates both polarization modalities as a strong baseline for future
reference. Our method consistently outperforms single-polarization models,
demonstrating the value of polarization synergy in mineral classification. We
have made the LITHOS Benchmark publicly available, comprising our dataset,
code, and pretrained models, to foster reproducibility and further research in
automated petrographic analysis.

Abstract: Lightweight vision classification models such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and

their performance has been predominantly benchmarked on ImageNet. This raises
critical questions: Do models that excel on ImageNet also generalize across
other domains? How can cross-dataset robustness be systematically quantified?
And which architectural elements consistently drive generalization under tight
resource constraints? Here, we present the first systematic evaluation of 11
lightweight vision models (2.5M parameters), trained under a fixed 100-epoch
schedule across 7 diverse datasets. We introduce the Cross-Dataset Score
(xScore), a unified metric that quantifies the consistency and robustness of
model performance across diverse visual domains. Our results show that (1)
ImageNet accuracy does not reliably predict performance on fine-grained or
medical datasets, (2) xScore provides a scalable predictor of mobile model
performance that can be estimated from just four datasets, and (3) certain
architectural components--such as isotropic convolutions with higher spatial
resolution and channel-wise attention--promote broader generalization, while
Transformer-based blocks yield little additional benefit, despite incurring
higher parameter overhead. This study provides a reproducible framework for
evaluating lightweight vision models beyond ImageNet, highlights key design
principles for mobile-friendly architectures, and guides the development of
future models that generalize robustly across diverse application domains.

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations (MERC) enhances emotional
understanding through the fusion of multimodal signals. However, unpredictable
modality absence in real-world scenarios significantly degrades the performance
of existing methods. Conventional missing-modality recovery approaches, which
depend on training with complete multimodal data, often suffer from semantic
distortion under extreme data distributions, such as fixed-modality absence. To
address this, we propose the Federated Dialogue-guided and Semantic-Consistent
Diffusion (FedDISC) framework, pioneering the integration of federated learning
into missing-modality recovery. By federated aggregation of modality-specific
diffusion models trained on clients and broadcasting them to clients missing
corresponding modalities, FedDISC overcomes single-client reliance on modality
completeness. Additionally, the DISC-Diffusion module ensures consistency in
context, speaker identity, and semantics between recovered and available
modalities, using a Dialogue Graph Network to capture conversational
dependencies and a Semantic Conditioning Network to enforce semantic alignment.
We further introduce a novel Alternating Frozen Aggregation strategy, which
cyclically freezes recovery and classifier modules to facilitate collaborative

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date geospatial data are essential for urban planning,
infrastructure monitoring, and environmental management. Yet, automating urban
monitoring remains difficult because curated datasets of specific urban
features and their changes are scarce. We introduce OSMGen, a generative
framework that creates realistic satellite imagery directly from raw
OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. Unlike prior work that relies on raster tiles, OSMGen
uses the full richness of OSM JSON, including vector geometries, semantic tags,
location, and time, giving fine-grained control over how scenes are generated.
A central feature of the framework is the ability to produce consistent
before-after image pairs: user edits to OSM inputs translate into targeted
visual changes, while the rest of the scene is preserved. This makes it
possible to generate training data that addresses scarcity and class imbalance,
and to give planners a simple way to preview proposed interventions by editing
map data. More broadly, OSMGen produces paired (JSON, image) data for both
static and changed states, paving the way toward a closed-loop system where
satellite imagery can automatically drive structured OSM updates. Source code
is available at https://github.com/amir-zsh/OSMGen.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The rapid rise of generative diffusion models has made distinguishing
authentic visual content from synthetic imagery increasingly challenging.
Traditional deepfake detection methods, which rely on frequency or pixel-level
artifacts, fail against modern text-to-image systems such as Stable Diffusion
and DALL-E that produce photorealistic and artifact-free results. This paper
introduces a diffusion-based forensic framework that leverages multi-strength
image reconstruction dynamics, termed diffusion snap-back, to identify
AI-generated images. By analysing how reconstruction metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and
PSNR) evolve across varying noise strengths, we extract interpretable
manifold-based features that differentiate real and synthetic images. Evaluated
on a balanced dataset of 4,000 images, our approach achieves 0.993 AUROC under
cross-validation and remains robust to common distortions such as compression
and noise. Despite using limited data and a single diffusion backbone (Stable
Diffusion v1.5), the proposed method demonstrates strong generalization and
interpretability, offering a foundation for scalable, model-agnostic synthetic
media forensics.

Abstract: Onboard cloud segmentation is a critical yet underexplored task in thermal
Earth observation (EO), particularly for CubeSat missions constrained by
limited hardware and spectral information. CubeSats often rely on a single
thermal band and lack sufficient labeled data, making conventional cloud
masking techniques infeasible. This work addresses these challenges by applying
transfer learning to thermal cloud segmentation for the FOREST-2 CubeSat, using
a UNet with a lightweight MobileNet encoder. We pretrain the model on the
public Landsat-7 Cloud Cover Assessment Dataset and fine-tune it with a small
set of mission-specific samples in a joint-training setup, improving the macro
F1 from 0.850 to 0.877 over FOREST-2-only baselines. We convert the model to a
TensorRT engine and demonstrate full-image inference in under 5 seconds on an
NVIDIA Jetson Nano. These results show that leveraging public datasets and
lightweight architectures can enable accurate, efficient thermal-only cloud
masking on-orbit, supporting real-time decision-making in data-limited EO
missions.

Abstract: Cultural heritage restoration in Bangladesh faces a dual challenge of limited
resources and scarce technical expertise. Traditional 3D digitization methods,
such as photogrammetry or LiDAR scanning, require expensive hardware, expert
operators, and extensive on-site access, which are often infeasible in
developing contexts. As a result, many of Bangladesh's architectural treasures,
from the Paharpur Buddhist Monastery to Ahsan Manzil, remain vulnerable to
decay and inaccessible in digital form. This paper introduces Oitijjo-3D, a
cost-free generative AI framework that democratizes 3D cultural preservation.
By using publicly available Google Street View imagery, Oitijjo-3D reconstructs
faithful 3D models of heritage structures through a two-stage pipeline -
multimodal visual reasoning with Gemini 2.5 Flash Image for structure-texture
synthesis, and neural image-to-3D generation through Hexagen for geometry
recovery. The system produces photorealistic, metrically coherent
reconstructions in seconds, achieving significant speedups compared to
conventional Structure-from-Motion pipelines, without requiring any specialized
hardware or expert supervision. Experiments on landmarks such as Ahsan Manzil,
Choto Sona Mosque, and Paharpur demonstrate that Oitijjo-3D preserves both
visual and structural fidelity while drastically lowering economic and
technical barriers. By turning open imagery into digital heritage, this work
reframes preservation as a community-driven, AI-assisted act of cultural
continuity for resource-limited nations.

Abstract: Video moment retrieval uses a text query to locate a moment from a given
untrimmed video reference. Locating corresponding video moments with text
queries helps people interact with videos efficiently. Current solutions for
this task have not considered conflict within location results from different
models, so various models cannot integrate correctly to produce better results.
This study introduces a reinforcement learning-based video moment retrieval
model that can scan the whole video once to find the moment's boundary while
producing its locational evidence. Moreover, we proposed a multi-agent system
framework that can use evidential learning to resolve conflicts between agents'
localization output. As a side product of observing and dealing with conflicts
between agents, we can decide whether a query has no corresponding moment in a
video (out-of-scope) without additional training, which is suitable for
real-world applications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the
effectiveness of our proposed methods compared with state-of-the-art
approaches. Furthermore, the results of our study reveal that modeling
competition and conflict of the multi-agent system is an effective way to
improve RL performance in moment retrieval and show the new role of evidential
learning in the multi-agent framework.

Abstract: Widespread clinical deployment of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems is

assistance framework that circumvents this barrier by capturing medical images
directly from displays using a camera system. The framework operates through an
automated pipeline that detects, restores, and analyzes on-screen medical
images, transforming camera-captured visual data into diagnostic-quality images
suitable for automated analysis and report generation. We validated VisionCAD
across diverse medical imaging datasets, demonstrating that our modular
architecture can flexibly utilize state-of-the-art diagnostic models for
specific tasks. The system achieves diagnostic performance comparable to
conventional CAD systems operating on original digital images, with an F1-score
degradation typically less than 2\% across classification tasks, while natural
language generation metrics for automated reports remain within 1\% of those
derived from original images. By requiring only a camera device and standard
computing resources, VisionCAD offers an accessible approach for AI-assisted
diagnosis, enabling the deployment of diagnostic capabilities in diverse
clinical settings without modifications to existing infrastructure.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized numerous
research fields, including computer vision and affective computing. As a
pivotal challenge in this interdisciplinary domain, facial expression
recognition (FER) has evolved from separate, domain-specific models to more
unified approaches. One promising avenue to unify FER tasks is converting
conventional FER datasets into visual question-answering (VQA) formats,
enabling the direct application of powerful generalist MLLMs for inference.
However, despite the success of cutting-edge MLLMs in various tasks, their
performance on FER tasks remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we
provide FERBench, a systematic benchmark that incorporates 20 state-of-the-art
MLLMs across four widely used FER datasets. Our results reveal that, while
MLLMs exhibit good classification performance, they still face significant
limitations in reasoning and interpretability. To this end, we introduce
post-training strategies aimed at enhancing the facial expression reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, we curate two high-quality and large-scale
datasets: UniFER-CoT-230K for cold-start initialization and UniFER-RLVR-360K
for reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), respectively.
Building upon them, we develop a unified and interpretable FER foundation model
termed UniFER-7B, which outperforms many open-sourced and closed-source
generalist MLLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro and Qwen2.5-VL-72B).

Abstract: Multimodal code generation has garnered significant interest within the
research community. Despite the notable success of recent vision-language

reliance on single-task training regimens fosters a narrow paradigm that
hinders the development of generalized \textbf{VI}sio\textbf{N} \textbf{C}ode
\textbf{I}ntelligence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{VinciCoder}, a
unified multimodal code generation model that addresses this limitation via a
two-stage training framework. We begin by constructing a large-scale Supervised
Finetuning (SFT) corpus comprising 1.6M image-code pairs for tasks involving
direct code generation and visual-based code refinement. Subsequently, we
introduce a Visual Reinforcement Learning (ViRL) strategy, which employs a
coarse-to-fine reward mechanism to improve visual fidelity by calculating
visual similarity across local and global image patches. Extensive experiments
on various multimodal code generation benchmarks demonstrate that VinciCoder
achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our
coarse-to-fine ViRL strategy. The code and model will be available at

Abstract: We present the first unified framework that jointly handles three
operationally heterogeneous saliency tasks, eg, SOD, CoSOD, and SIS, by casting
each as a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning process in a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) to bridge task heterogeneity. CoT training follows a two-stage paradigm:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). To enhance CoT
quality in RL, we propose Confidence-Guided Policy Optimization (CGPO), a
lightweight single-sample algorithm that leverages the discrepancy between
reward and model confidence as a per-sample advantage signal. This design
naturally focuses updates on informative responses while eliminating group
sampling, thereby addressing GRPO's key limitations: confidence-agnostic
learning, signal dilution, and prohibitive computational overhead. We also
introduce an "output-to-reasoning" strategy to construct high-fidelity SFT data
that ensures logical consistency with ground-truth masks. Experiments show our
model matches or outperforms specialized SOTA methods and strong closed-source
VLMs across all tasks, especially achieving an S-measure of 0.899 on CoCA for
CoSOD, surpassing the prior best by 8.0 percentage points, despite using far
less training data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale pretraining in natural language processing
have enabled pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP to effectively
align images and text, significantly improving performance in zero-shot image
classification tasks. Subsequent studies have further demonstrated that
cropping images into smaller regions and using large language models to
generate multiple descriptions for each caption can further enhance model
performance. However, due to the inherent sensitivity of CLIP, random image
crops can introduce misinformation and bias, as many images share similar
features at small scales. To address this issue, we propose
Localized-Globalized Cross-Alignment (LGCA), a framework that first captures
the local features of an image and then repeatedly selects the most salient
regions and expands them. The similarity score is designed to incorporate both
the original and expanded images, enabling the model to capture both local and
global features while minimizing misinformation. Additionally, we provide a
theoretical analysis demonstrating that the time complexity of LGCA remains the
same as that of the original model prior to the repeated expansion process,
highlighting its efficiency and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method substantially improves zero-shot performance across diverse
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative models, detecting generated fake
images to prevent their malicious use has become a critical issue recently.
Existing methods frame this challenge as a naive binary image classification
task. However, such methods focus only on visual clues, yielding trained
detectors susceptible to overfitting specific image patterns and incapable of
generalizing to unseen models. In this paper, we address this issue from a
multi-modal perspective and find that fake images cannot be properly aligned
with corresponding captions compared to real images. Upon this observation, we
propose a simple yet effective detector termed ITEM by leveraging the
image-text misalignment in a joint visual-language space as discriminative
clues. Specifically, we first measure the misalignment of the images and
captions in pre-trained CLIP's space, and then tune a MLP head to perform the
usual detection task. Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical misalignment
scheme that first focuses on the whole image and then each semantic object
described in the caption, which can explore both global and fine-grained local
semantic misalignment as clues. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method against other state-of-the-art competitors with
impressive generalization and robustness on various recent generative models.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis, but the
generated high-quality images raise concerns about potential malicious use.
Existing detectors often struggle to capture discriminative clues across
different models and settings, limiting their generalization to unseen
diffusion models and robustness to various perturbations. To address this
issue, we observe that diffusion-generated images exhibit progressively larger
differences from natural real images across low- to high-frequency bands. Based
on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective representation by enhancing
the Frequency Forgery Clue (F^2C) across all frequency bands. Specifically, we
introduce a frequency-selective function which serves as a weighted filter to
the Fourier spectrum, suppressing less discriminative bands while enhancing
more informative ones. This approach, grounded in a comprehensive analysis of
frequency-based differences between natural real and diffusion-generated
images, enables general detection of images from unseen diffusion models and
provides robust resilience to various perturbations. Extensive experiments on
various diffusion-generated image datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art detectors with superior generalization and
robustness.

Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has significantly
advanced vision-language modeling by aligning image-text pairs from large-scale

uncurated Internet-sourced data exposes it to data poisoning and backdoor
risks. While existing studies primarily investigate image-based attacks, the
text modality, which is equally central to CLIP's training, remains
underexplored. In this work, we introduce ToxicTextCLIP, a framework for
generating high-quality adversarial texts that target CLIP during the
pre-training phase. The framework addresses two key challenges: semantic
misalignment caused by background inconsistency with the target class, and the
scarcity of background-consistent texts. To this end, ToxicTextCLIP iteratively
applies: 1) a background-aware selector that prioritizes texts with background
content aligned to the target class, and 2) a background-driven augmenter that
generates semantically coherent and diverse poisoned samples. Extensive
experiments on classification and retrieval tasks show that ToxicTextCLIP
achieves up to 95.83% poisoning success and 98.68% backdoor Hit@1, while
bypassing RoCLIP, CleanCLIP and SafeCLIP defenses. The source code can be

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of vestibular schwannoma (VS) on Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) is essential for patient management but often requires
time-intensive manual annotations by experts. While recent advances in deep
learning (DL) have facilitated automated segmentation, challenges remain in
achieving robust performance across diverse datasets and complex clinical

framework for iterative segmentation and quality refinement of VS in MRI. We
combine data from multiple centres and rely on expert consensus for
trustworthiness of the annotations. We show that our approach enables effective
and resource-efficient generalisation of automated segmentation models to a
target data distribution. The framework achieved a significant improvement in
segmentation accuracy with a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) increase from
0.9125 to 0.9670 on our target internal validation dataset, while maintaining
stable performance on representative external datasets. Expert evaluation on
143 scans further highlighted areas for model refinement, revealing nuanced
cases where segmentation required expert intervention. The proposed approach is
estimated to enhance efficiency by approximately 37.4% compared to the
conventional manual annotation process. Overall, our human-in-the-loop model
training approach achieved high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
potential as a clinically adaptable and generalisable strategy for automated VS
segmentation in diverse clinical settings. The dataset includes 190 patients,
with tumour annotations available for 534 longitudinal contrast-enhanced

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce FedMGP, a new paradigm for personalized federated
prompt learning in vision-language models. FedMGP equips each client with
multiple groups of paired textual and visual prompts, enabling the model to
capture diverse, fine-grained semantic and instance-level cues. A diversity
loss is introduced to drive each prompt group to specialize in distinct and
complementary semantic aspects, ensuring that the groups collectively cover a
broader range of local characteristics. During communication, FedMGP employs a
dynamic prompt aggregation strategy based on similarity-guided probabilistic
sampling: each client computes the cosine similarity between its prompt groups
and the global prompts from the previous round, then samples s groups via a
softmax-weighted distribution. This soft selection mechanism preferentially
aggregates semantically aligned knowledge while still enabling exploration of
underrepresented patterns effectively balancing the preservation of common
knowledge with client-specific features. Notably, FedMGP maintains parameter
efficiency by redistributing a fixed prompt capacity across multiple groups,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest communication parameters
among all federated prompt learning methods. Theoretical analysis shows that
our dynamic aggregation strategy promotes robust global representation learning
by reinforcing shared semantics while suppressing client-specific noise.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedMGP consistently outperforms prior
approaches in both personalization and domain generalization across diverse
federated vision-language benchmarks. The code will be released on

Abstract: We introduce Diff4Splat, a feed-forward method that synthesizes controllable

from large-scale 4D datasets. Given a single input image, a camera trajectory,
and an optional text prompt, Diff4Splat directly predicts a deformable 3D
Gaussian field that encodes appearance, geometry, and motion, all in a single
forward pass, without test-time optimization or post-hoc refinement. At the
core of our framework lies a video latent transformer, which augments video
diffusion models to jointly capture spatio-temporal dependencies and predict
time-varying 3D Gaussian primitives. Training is guided by objectives on
appearance fidelity, geometric accuracy, and motion consistency, enabling
Diff4Splat to synthesize high-quality 4D scenes in 30 seconds. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of Diff4Splatacross video generation, novel view synthesis,
and geometry extraction, where it matches or surpasses optimization-based
methods for dynamic scene synthesis while being significantly more efficient.

which introduces unique challenges including a 360{\deg} Field of View (FoV),
resolution dilution, and severe view-dependent distortions. Conventional MOT
methods designed for narrow-FoV pinhole cameras generalize unsatisfactorily
under these conditions. To address panoramic distortion, large search space,
and identity ambiguity under a 360{\deg} FoV, OmniTrack++ adopts a
feedback-driven framework that progressively refines perception with trajectory
cues. A DynamicSSM block first stabilizes panoramic features, implicitly
alleviating geometric distortion. On top of normalized representations,
FlexiTrack Instances use trajectory-informed feedback for flexible localization
and reliable short-term association. To ensure long-term robustness, an
ExpertTrack Memory consolidates appearance cues via a Mixture-of-Experts
design, enabling recovery from fragmented tracks and reducing identity drift.
Finally, a Tracklet Management module adaptively switches between end-to-end
and tracking-by-detection modes according to scene dynamics, offering a
balanced and scalable solution for panoramic MOT. To support rigorous
evaluation, we establish the EmboTrack benchmark, a comprehensive dataset for
panoramic MOT that includes QuadTrack, captured with a quadruped robot, and
BipTrack, collected with a bipedal wheel-legged robot. Together, these datasets
span wide-angle environments and diverse motion patterns, providing a
challenging testbed for real-world panoramic perception. Extensive experiments
on JRDB and EmboTrack demonstrate that OmniTrack++ achieves state-of-the-art
performance, yielding substantial HOTA improvements of +25.5% on JRDB and
+43.07% on QuadTrack over the original OmniTrack. Datasets and code will be
made publicly available at https://github.com/xifen523/OmniTrack.

Abstract: Video generative models pretrained on large-scale datasets can produce
high-quality videos, but are often conditioned on text or a single image,
limiting controllability and applicability. We introduce ID-Composer, a novel
framework that addresses this gap by tackling multi-subject video generation
from a text prompt and reference images. This task is challenging as it
requires preserving subject identities, integrating semantics across subjects
and modalities, and maintaining temporal consistency. To faithfully preserve
the subject consistency and textual information in synthesized videos,
ID-Composer designs a \textbf{hierarchical identity-preserving attention
mechanism}, which effectively aggregates features within and across subjects
and modalities. To effectively allow for the semantic following of user
intention, we introduce \textbf{semantic understanding via pretrained
vision-language model (VLM)}, leveraging VLM's superior semantic understanding
to provide fine-grained guidance and capture complex interactions between
multiple subjects. Considering that standard diffusion loss often fails in
aligning the critical concepts like subject ID, we employ an \textbf{online
reinforcement learning phase} to drive the overall training objective of
ID-Composer into RLVR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model
surpasses existing methods in identity preservation, temporal consistency, and
video quality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision language models such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in zero
shot classification, but remain susceptible to spurious correlations, where
irrelevant visual features influence predictions. Existing debiasing methods
often require access to training data and explicit group labels to perform
fine-tuning or adjust embeddings, which limits their practicality in real-world
settings. Test-time methods attempt to avoid this constraint, but many still
depend on prior knowledge of dataset specific biases, limiting their
generalizability in open set settings. In this work, we propose a test-time
debiasing method for ViT based CLIP models that requires no additional training
or assumptions of bias annotations. Our approach uses a pretrained segmentation
model to isolate the target visual attribute, then adjusts the non target
regions so that their embeddings are uniformly similar to all class specific
text prompts. This procedure removes unintended bias signals from confounding
visual regions while preserving the target attribute. Experiments on Waterbirds
and CelebA show that our method outperforms existing test-time debiasing
approaches in both group robustness metrics and Attention IoU. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of segmentation guided interventions for scalable
and annotation free bias mitigation in vision language models.

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events within video
segments. In scenarios such as surveillance or industrial process monitoring,
anomaly detection is of critical importance. While existing approaches are
semi-automated, requiring human assessment for anomaly detection, traditional
VADs offer limited output as either normal or anomalous. We propose Text-guided
Fine-Grained Video Anomaly Detection (T-VAD), a framework built upon Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM). T-VAD introduces an Anomaly Heatmap Decoder (AHD)
that performs pixel-wise visual-textual feature alignment to generate
fine-grained anomaly heatmaps. Furthermore, we design a Region-aware Anomaly
Encoder (RAE) that transforms the heatmaps into learnable textual embeddings,
guiding the LVLM to accurately identify and localize anomalous events in
videos. This significantly enhances both the granularity and interactivity of
anomaly detection. The proposed method achieving SOTA performance by
demonstrating 94.8% Area Under the Curve (AUC, specifically micro-AUC) and
67.8%/76.7% accuracy in anomaly heatmaps (RBDC/TBDC) on the UBnormal dataset,

Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is critical for enhancing operational
safety, ensuring product quality, and optimizing manufacturing efficiency
across global industries. However, the IAD algorithms are severely constrained
by the limitations of existing public benchmarks. Current datasets exhibit
restricted category diversity and insufficient scale, frequently resulting in
metric saturation and limited model transferability to real-world scenarios. To
address this gap, we introduce Real-IAD Variety, the largest and most diverse
IAD benchmark, comprising 198,960 high-resolution images across 160 distinct
object categories. Its diversity is ensured through comprehensive coverage of
28 industries, 24 material types, and 22 color variations. Our comprehensive
experimental analysis validates the benchmark's substantial challenge:
state-of-the-art multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection methods experience
significant performance degradation when scaled from 30 to 160 categories.
Crucially, we demonstrate that vision-language models exhibit remarkable
robustness to category scale-up, with minimal performance variation across
different category counts, significantly enhancing generalization capabilities
in diverse industrial contexts. The unprecedented scale and complexity of
Real-IAD Variety position it as an essential resource for training and
evaluating next-generation foundation models for anomaly detection. By
providing this comprehensive benchmark with rigorous evaluation protocols
across multi-class unsupervised, multi-view, and zero-/few-shot settings, we
aim to accelerate research beyond domain-specific constraints, enabling the
development of scalable, general-purpose anomaly detection systems. Real-IAD
Variety will be made publicly available to facilitate innovation in this
critical field.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method for precise learning and synthesizing
multi-instance semantics from a single image. The difficulty of this problem
lies in the limited training data, and it becomes even more challenging when
the instances to be learned have similar semantics or appearance. To address
this, we propose a penalty-based attention optimization to disentangle similar
semantics during the learning stage. Then, in the synthesis, we introduce and
optimize box control in attention layers to further mitigate semantic leakage
while precisely controlling the output layout. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method achieves disentangled and high-quality semantic learning and
synthesis, strikingly balancing editability and instance consistency. Our
method remains robust when dealing with semantically or visually similar
instances or rare-seen objects. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Although 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves efficient rendering for novel
view synthesis, extending it to dynamic scenes still results in substantial
memory overhead from replicating Gaussians across frames. To address this
challenge, we propose 4D Neural Voxel Splatting (4D-NVS), which combines
voxel-based representations with neural Gaussian splatting for efficient
dynamic scene modeling. Instead of generating separate Gaussian sets per
timestamp, our method employs a compact set of neural voxels with learned
deformation fields to model temporal dynamics. The design greatly reduces
memory consumption and accelerates training while preserving high image
quality. We further introduce a novel view refinement stage that selectively
improves challenging viewpoints through targeted optimization, maintaining
global efficiency while enhancing rendering quality for difficult viewing
angles. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches with significant memory reduction and faster training, enabling
real-time rendering with superior visual fidelity.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to leverage labeled samples from
known categories to cluster unlabeled data that may include both known and
unknown categories. While existing methods have achieved impressive results
under standard conditions, their performance often deteriorates in the presence
of distribution shifts. In this paper, we explore a more realistic task:
Domain-Shifted Generalized Category Discovery (DS\_GCD), where the unlabeled
data includes not only unknown categories but also samples from unknown
domains. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
\textbf{\underline{F}}requency-guided Gene\textbf{\underline{r}}alized
Cat\textbf{\underline{e}}gory Discov\textbf{\underline{e}}ry framework (FREE)
that enhances the model's ability to discover categories under distributional
shift by leveraging frequency-domain information. Specifically, we first
propose a frequency-based domain separation strategy that partitions samples
into known and unknown domains by measuring their amplitude differences. We
then propose two types of frequency-domain perturbation strategies: a
cross-domain strategy, which adapts to new distributions by exchanging
amplitude components across domains, and an intra-domain strategy, which
enhances robustness to intra-domain variations within the unknown domain.
Furthermore, we extend the self-supervised contrastive objective and semantic
clustering loss to better guide the training process. Finally, we introduce a
clustering-difficulty-aware resampling technique to adaptively focus on
harder-to-cluster categories, further enhancing model performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates the impact of
distributional shifts across various benchmark datasets and achieves superior
performance in discovering both known and unknown categories.

Abstract: Video anomalies often depend on contextual information available and temporal
evolution. Non-anomalous action in one context can be anomalous in some other
context. Most anomaly detectors, however, do not notice this type of context,
which seriously limits their capability to generalize to new, real-life
situations. Our work addresses the context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection
challenge, in which systems need to learn adaptively to detect new events by
correlating temporal and appearance features with textual traces of memory in
real time. Our approach defines a memory-augmented pipeline, correlating
temporal signals with visual embeddings using cross-attention, and real-time
zero-shot anomaly classification by contextual similarity scoring. We achieve
90.4\% AUC on UCF-Crime and 83.67\% AP on XD-Violence, a new state-of-the-art
among zero-shot models. Our model achieves real-time inference with high
precision and explainability for deployment. We show that, by fusing
cross-attention temporal fusion and contextual memory, we achieve high fidelity
anomaly detection, a step towards the applicability of zero-shot models in
real-world surveillance and infrastructure monitoring.

Abstract: How far are deep models from real-world video anomaly understanding (VAU)?
Current works typically emphasize on detecting unexpected occurrences deviated
from normal patterns or comprehending anomalous events with interpretable
descriptions. However, they exhibit only a superficial comprehension of
real-world anomalies, with limited breadth in complex principles and subtle
context that distinguish the anomalies from normalities, e.g., climbing cliffs
with safety gear vs. without it. To this end, we introduce CueBench, the first
of its kind Benchmark, devoted to Context-aware video anomalies within a
Unified Evaluation framework. We comprehensively establish an event-centric
hierarchical taxonomy that anchors two core event types: 14 conditional and 18
absolute anomaly events, defined by their refined semantics from diverse
contexts across 174 scenes and 198 attributes. Based on this, we propose to
unify and benchmark context-aware VAU with various challenging tasks across
recognition, temporal grounding, detection, and anticipation. This also serves
as a rigorous and fair probing evaluation suite for generative-discriminative
as well as generalized-specialized vision-language models (VLMs). To address
the challenges underlying CueBench, we further develop Cue-R1 based on R1-style
reinforcement fine-tuning with verifiable, task-aligned, and hierarchy-refined
rewards in a unified generative manner. Extensive results on CueBench reveal
that, existing VLMs are still far from satisfactory real-world anomaly
understanding, while our Cue-R1 surpasses these state-of-the-art approaches by
over 24% on average.

Abstract: Understanding surgical instrument-tissue interactions requires not only
identifying which instrument performs which action on which anatomical target,
but also grounding these interactions spatially within the surgical scene.
Existing surgical action triplet recognition methods are limited to learning
from frame-level classification, failing to reliably link actions to specific
instrument instances.Previous attempts at spatial grounding have primarily
relied on class activation maps, which lack the precision and robustness
required for detailed instrument-tissue interaction analysis.To address this
gap, we propose grounding surgical action triplets with instrument instance
segmentation, or triplet segmentation for short, a new unified task which
produces spatially grounded <instrument, verb, target> outputs.We start by
presenting CholecTriplet-Seg, a large-scale dataset containing over 30,000
annotated frames, linking instrument instance masks with action verb and
anatomical target annotations, and establishing the first benchmark for
strongly supervised, instance-level triplet grounding and evaluation.To learn
triplet segmentation, we propose TargetFusionNet, a novel architecture that
extends Mask2Former with a target-aware fusion mechanism to address the
challenge of accurate anatomical target prediction by fusing weak anatomy
priors with instrument instance queries.Evaluated across recognition,
detection, and triplet segmentation metrics, TargetFusionNet consistently
improves performance over existing baselines, demonstrating that strong
instance supervision combined with weak target priors significantly enhances
the accuracy and robustness of surgical action understanding.Triplet
segmentation establishes a unified framework for spatially grounding surgical
action triplets. The proposed benchmark and architecture pave the way for more
interpretable, surgical scene understanding.

Abstract: Individual tree segmentation (ITS) from LiDAR point clouds is fundamental for
applications such as forest inventory, carbon monitoring and biodiversity
assessment. Traditionally, ITS has been achieved with unsupervised
geometry-based algorithms, while more recent advances have shifted toward
supervised deep learning (DL). In the past, progress in method development was
hindered by the lack of large-scale benchmark datasets, and the availability of
novel data formats, particularly multispectral (MS) LiDAR, remains limited to
this day, despite evidence that MS reflectance can improve the accuracy of ITS.
This study introduces FGI-EMIT, the first large-scale MS airborne laser
scanning benchmark dataset for ITS. Captured at wavelengths 532, 905, and 1,550
nm, the dataset consists of 1,561 manually annotated trees, with a particular
focus on small understory trees. Using FGI-EMIT, we comprehensively benchmarked
four conventional unsupervised algorithms and four supervised DL approaches.
Hyperparameters of unsupervised methods were optimized using a Bayesian
approach, while DL models were trained from scratch. Among the unsupervised
methods, Treeiso achieved the highest test set F1-score of 52.7%. The DL
approaches performed significantly better overall, with the best model,
ForestFormer3D, attaining an F1-score of 73.3%. The most significant difference
was observed in understory trees, where ForestFormer3D exceeded Treeiso by 25.9
percentage points. An ablation study demonstrated that current DL-based
approaches generally fail to leverage MS reflectance information when it is
provided as additional input features, although single channel reflectance can
improve accuracy marginally, especially for understory trees. A performance
analysis across point densities further showed that DL methods consistently
remain superior to unsupervised algorithms, even at densities as low as 10
points/m$^2$.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging suffers from substantial data heterogeneity and

representation of MRI contrast would enable a wide range of downstream
utilities, from automatic sequence recognition to harmonization and quality
control, without relying on manual annotations. To this end, we introduce
MR-CLIP, a metadata-guided framework that learns MRI contrast representations
by aligning volumetric images with their DICOM acquisition parameters. The
resulting embeddings shows distinct clusters of MRI sequences and outperform
supervised 3D baselines under data scarcity in few-shot sequence
classification. Moreover, MR-CLIP enables unsupervised data quality control by
identifying corrupted or inconsistent metadata through image-metadata embedding
distances. By transforming routinely available acquisition metadata into a
supervisory signal, MR-CLIP provides a scalable foundation for label-efficient
MRI analysis across diverse clinical datasets.

Abstract: Quantization techniques, including quantization-aware training (QAT) and
post-training quantization (PTQ), have become essential for inference
acceleration of image super-resolution (SR) networks. Compared to QAT, PTQ has
garnered significant attention as it eliminates the need for ground truth and
model retraining. However, existing PTQ methods for SR often fail to achieve
satisfactory performance as they overlook the impact of outliers in activation.
Our empirical analysis reveals that these prevalent activation outliers are
strongly correlated with image color information, and directly removing them
leads to significant performance degradation. Motivated by this, we propose a
dual-region quantization strategy that partitions activations into an outlier
region and a dense region, applying uniform quantization to each region
independently to better balance bit-width allocation. Furthermore, we observe
that different network layers exhibit varying sensitivities to quantization,
leading to different levels of performance degradation. To address this, we
introduce sensitivity-aware finetuning that encourages the model to focus more
on highly sensitive layers, further enhancing quantization performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing PTQ
approaches across various SR networks and datasets, while achieving performance
comparable to QAT methods in most scenarios with at least a 75 speedup.

prompt. WANDER operates directly on natural language prompts, employing a Large
Language Model (LLM) for semantic evolution of diverse sets of images, and
using CLIP embeddings to quantify novelty. We additionally apply emitters to
guide the search into distinct regions of the prompt space, and demonstrate
that they boost the diversity of the generated images. Empirical evaluations
using FLUX-DEV for generation and GPT-4o-mini for mutation demonstrate that
WANDER significantly outperforms existing evolutionary prompt optimization
baselines in diversity metrics. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of
emitters.

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging is widely used to reduce radiation exposure to
mitigate high exposure side effects, but often suffers from noise and artifacts
that affect diagnostic accuracy. To tackle this issue, deep learning models
have been developed to enhance LDCT images. Various loss functions have been
employed, including classical approaches such as Mean Square Error and
adversarial losses, as well as customized loss functions(LFs) designed for
specific architectures. Although these models achieve remarkable performance in
terms of PSNR and SSIM, these metrics are limited in their ability to reflect
perceptual quality, especially for medical images. In this paper, we focus on
one of the most critical elements of DL-based architectures, namely the loss
function. We conduct an objective analysis of the relevance of different loss
functions for LDCT image quality enhancement and their consistency with image
quality metrics. Our findings reveal inconsistencies between LFs and quality
metrics, and highlight the need of consideration of image quality metrics when
developing a new loss function for image quality enhancement.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown strong performance in diagnosing Alzheimer's

training datasets largely composed of North American cohorts such as those in
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). However, their
generalization to underrepresented populations remains underexplored. In this
study, we benchmark convolutional and Transformer-based models on the ADNI
dataset and assess their generalization performance on a novel Latin American
clinical cohort from the FLENI Institute in Buenos Aires, Argentina. We show
that while all models achieve high AUCs on ADNI (up to .96, .97), their
performance drops substantially on FLENI (down to .82, .80, respectively),
revealing a significant domain shift. The tested architectures demonstrated
similar performance, calling into question the supposed advantages of
transformers for this specific task. Through ablation studies, we identify
per-image normalization and a correct sampling selection as key factors for
generalization. Occlusion sensitivity analysis further reveals that models
trained on ADNI, generally attend to canonical hypometabolic regions for the AD
class, but focus becomes unclear for the other classes and for FLENI scans.
These findings highlight the need for population-aware validation of diagnostic
AI models and motivate future work on domain adaptation and cohort
diversification.

Abstract: Social media has exacerbated the promotion of Western beauty norms, leading
to negative self-image, particularly in women and girls, and causing harm such
as body dysmorphia. Increasingly content on the internet has been artificially
generated, leading to concerns that these norms are being exaggerated. The aim
of this work is to study how generative AI models may encode 'beauty' and erase
'ugliness', and discuss the implications of this for society. To investigate
these aims, we create two image generation pipelines: a text-to-image model and
a text-to-language model-to image model. We develop a structured beauty
taxonomy which we use to prompt three language models (LMs) and two
text-to-image models to cumulatively generate 5984 images using our two
pipelines. We then recruit women and non-binary social media users to evaluate
1200 of the images through a Likert-scale within-subjects study. Participants
show high agreement in their ratings. Our results show that 86.5% of generated
images depicted people with lighter skin tones, 22% contained explicit content
despite Safe for Work (SFW) training, and 74% were rated as being in a younger
age demographic. In particular, the images of non-binary individuals were rated
as both younger and more hypersexualised, indicating troubling intersectional
effects. Notably, prompts encoded with 'negative' or 'ugly' beauty traits (such
as "a wide nose") consistently produced higher Not SFW (NSFW) ratings
regardless of gender. This work sheds light on the pervasive demographic biases
related to beauty standards present in generative AI models -- biases that are
actively perpetuated by model developers, such as via negative prompting. We
conclude by discussing the implications of this on society, which include
pollution of the data streams and active erasure of features that do not fall
inside the stereotype of what is considered beautiful by developers.

unavailability of monitoring without human intervention. The fast growth of
machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to new ways to
detect animals. However, current systems are limited by dependence on single
object detection algorithms, less accessible notification platforms, and
limited deterrent mechanisms. This research suggests an IoT-enabled animal
detection system for durian crops. The system integrates YOLOv5 and SSD object
detection algorithms to improve detection accuracy. The system provides
real-time monitoring, with detected intrusions automatically reported to
farmers via Telegram notifications for rapid response. An automated sound
mechanism (e.g., tiger roar) is triggered once the animal is detected. The
YOLO+SSD model achieved accuracy rates of elephant, boar, and monkey at 90%,
85% and 70%, respectively. The system shows the highest accuracy in daytime and
decreases at night, regardless of whether the image is still or a video.
Overall, this study contributes a comprehensive and practical framework that
combines detection, notification, and deterrence, paving the way for future
innovations in automated farming solutions.

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is an important task for real-world applications. To
avoid costly manual annotations, existing methods have explored generating
pseudo labels by transferring 2D masks from foundation models to 3D. However,
this approach is often suboptimal since the video frames are processed
independently. This causes inconsistent segmentation granularity and
conflicting 3D pseudo labels, which degrades the accuracy of final
segmentation. To address this, we introduce a Granularity-Consistent automatic
2D Mask Tracking approach that maintains temporal correspondences across
frames, eliminating conflicting pseudo labels. Combined with a three-stage
curriculum learning framework, our approach progressively trains from
fragmented single-view data to unified multi-view annotations, ultimately
globally coherent full-scene supervision. This structured learning pipeline
enables the model to progressively expose to pseudo-labels of increasing
consistency. Thus, we can robustly distill a consistent 3D representation from
initially fragmented and contradictory 2D priors. Experimental results
demonstrated that our method effectively generated consistent and accurate 3D
segmentations. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art
results on standard benchmarks and open-vocabulary ability.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple institutions to cooperatively train
machine learning models while retaining sensitive data at the source, which has
great utility in privacy-sensitive environments. However, FL systems remain
vulnerable to membership-inference attacks and data heterogeneity. This paper
presents FedOnco-Bench, a reproducible benchmark for privacy-aware FL using
synthetic oncologic CT scans with tumor annotations. It evaluates segmentation
performance and privacy leakage across FL methods: FedAvg, FedProx, FedBN, and
FedAvg with DP-SGD. Results show a distinct trade-off between privacy and
utility: FedAvg is high performance (Dice around 0.85) with more privacy
leakage (attack AUC about 0.72), while DP-SGD provides a higher level of
privacy (AUC around 0.25) at the cost of accuracy (Dice about 0.79). FedProx
and FedBN offer balanced performance under heterogeneous data, especially with
non-identical distributed client data. FedOnco-Bench serves as a standardized,
open-source platform for benchmarking and developing privacy-preserving FL
methods for medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled remarkable

remains constrained by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly
accessible datasets built specifically for medical image editing with strict
anatomical and clinical constraints. We introduce Med-Banana-50K, a
comprehensive 50K-image dataset for instruction-based medical image editing
spanning three modalities (chest X-ray, brain MRI, fundus photography) and 23
disease types. Our dataset is constructed by leveraging Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image
to generate bidirectional edits (lesion addition and removal) from real medical
images. What distinguishes Med-Banana-50K from general-domain editing datasets
is our systematic approach to medical quality control: we employ LLM-as-Judge
with a medically grounded rubric (instruction compliance, structural
plausibility, realism, and fidelity preservation) and history-aware iterative
refinement up to five rounds. Beyond single-turn editing, Med-Banana-50K
includes 37K failed attempts with full conversation logs for preference
learning and alignment research. By providing this large-scale, medically
validated, and fully documented resource, Med-Banana-50K establishes a
foundation for training and evaluating the next generation of medical image
editing models.Our dataset and code are publicly available at

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) grounding is a key function of computer-use
agents, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable screen regions.
Existing approaches based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically
formulate it as a text-based coordinate generation task, yet directly
generating precise coordinates from visual inputs remains challenging and
computationally intensive. An intuitive way to implement GUI grounding is to
first select visual patches relevant to the instructions and then determine the
precise click location within those patches. Based on the observations that
general MLLMs have some native grounding capability, nested within their
attentions, we propose GUI-AIMA, an attention-based and coordinate-free
supervised fine-tuning framework for efficient GUI grounding. GUI-AIMA aligns
the intrinsic multimodal attention of MLLMs with patch-wise grounding signals.
These signals are calculated adaptively for diverse user instructions by
multi-head aggregation on simplified query-visual attention matrices. Besides,
its coordinate-free manner can easily integrate a plug-and-play zoom-in stage.
GUI-AIMA-3B was trained with only 85k screenshots, demonstrating exceptional
data efficiency and verifying that light training can trigger the native
grounding capability of MLLMs. It achieves state-of-the-art performance among
3B models, attaining an average accuracy of 58.6% on ScreenSpot-Pro and 62.2%
on OSWorld-G. Project page: https://github.com/sjz5202/GUI-AIMA

Abstract: Pancreas segmentation in medical image processing is a persistent challenge
due to its small size, low contrast against adjacent tissues, and significant
topological variations. Traditional level set methods drive boundary evolution
using gradient flows, often ignoring pointwise topological effects. Conversely,
deep learning-based segmentation networks extract rich semantic features but
frequently sacrifice structural details. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
model named TA-LSDiff, which combined topology-aware diffusion probabilistic
model and level set energy, achieving segmentation without explicit geometric
evolution. This energy function guides implicit curve evolution by integrating
the input image and deep features through four complementary terms. To further
enhance boundary precision, we introduce a pixel-adaptive refinement module
that locally modulates the energy function using affinity weighting from
neighboring evidence. Ablation studies systematically quantify the contribution
of each proposed component. Evaluations on four public pancreas datasets
demonstrate that TA-LSDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming
existing methods. These results establish TA-LSDiff as a practical and accurate
solution for pancreas segmentation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
various multimodal tasks, where position encoding plays a vital role in
modeling both the sequential structure of textual information and the spatial
structure of visual information. However, current VLMs commonly adopt
modality-unified 1D or 2D positional indexing strategies, which treat textual
and visual tokens uniformly without accounting for their distinct structural
properties and sequential continuity for text and spatial coherence for vision.
To address this limitation, we propose OMEGA, a novel position encoding
framework that employs Modality-Specific Position Encoding (MSPE) to assign
positional indices while preserving the inherent structures of each modality
across separate coordinate dimensions. Additionally, to align the information
density of multimodal data in the positional index space, OMEGA introduces
Global Adaptive Encoding Step Scaling (GAESS), which adaptively adjusts the
position encoding step size of visual tokens based on the embedding entropy of
both modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that OMEGA consistently
enhances VLM performance across diverse architectures and VQA benchmarks. On
visual-intensive tasks, OMEGA achieves up to 3.43% improvement over baseline
position encoding strategies on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, with consistent gains observed
across larger models including Qwen2.5-VL-7B and LLaVA-v1.5-7B.

Abstract: Visual-Language Pre-training (VLP) models have achieved significant
performance across various downstream tasks. However, they remain vulnerable to
adversarial examples. While prior efforts focus on improving the adversarial
transferability of multimodal adversarial examples through cross-modal
interactions, these approaches suffer from overfitting issues, due to a lack of
input diversity by relying excessively on information from adversarial examples
in one modality when crafting attacks in another. To address this issue, we
draw inspiration from strategies in some adversarial training methods and
propose a novel attack called Local Shuffle and Sample-based Attack (LSSA).
LSSA randomly shuffles one of the local image blocks, thus expanding the
original image-text pairs, generating adversarial images, and sampling around
them. Then, it utilizes both the original and sampled images to generate the
adversarial texts. Extensive experiments on multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that LSSA significantly enhances the transferability of multimodal
adversarial examples across diverse VLP models and downstream tasks. Moreover,
LSSA outperforms other advanced attacks on Large Vision-Language Models.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become a universal backbone for both image
recognition and image generation. Yet their Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA)
layer still performs a quadratic query-key interaction for every token pair,
spending the bulk of computation on visually weak or redundant correlations. We
introduce Visual-Contrast Attention (VCA), a drop-in replacement for MHSA that
injects an explicit notion of discrimination while reducing the theoretical
complexity from O(N N C) to O(N n C) with n << N. VCA first distils each head's
dense query field into a handful of spatially pooled visual-contrast tokens,
then splits them into a learnable positive and negative stream whose
differential interaction highlights what truly separates one region from
another. The module adds fewer than 0.3M parameters to a DeiT-Tiny backbone,
requires no extra FLOPs, and is wholly architecture-agnostic. Empirically, VCA
lifts DeiT-Tiny top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K from 72.2% to 75.6% (+3.4) and
improves three strong hierarchical ViTs by up to 3.1%, while in
class-conditional ImageNet generation it lowers FID-50K by 2.1 to 5.2 points
across both diffusion (DiT) and flow (SiT) models. Extensive ablations confirm
that (i) spatial pooling supplies low-variance global cues, (ii) dual
positional embeddings are indispensable for contrastive reasoning, and (iii)
combining the two in both stages yields the strongest synergy. VCA therefore
offers a simple path towards faster and sharper Vision Transformers. The source

Abstract: Though deep neural networks exhibit superior performance on various tasks,
they are still plagued by adversarial examples. Adversarial training has been
demonstrated to be the most effective method to defend against adversarial
attacks. However, existing adversarial training methods show that the model
robustness has apparent oscillations and overfitting issues in the training
process, degrading the defense efficacy. To address these issues, we propose a
novel framework called Parameter Interpolation Adversarial Training (PIAT).
PIAT tunes the model parameters between each epoch by interpolating the
parameters of the previous and current epochs. It makes the decision boundary
of model change more moderate and alleviates the overfitting issue, helping the
model converge better and achieving higher model robustness. In addition, we
suggest using the Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) to further improve the
robustness by aligning the relative magnitude of logits between clean and
adversarial examples rather than the absolute magnitude. Extensive experiments
conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework could
prominently improve the robustness of both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
and Vision Transformers (ViTs).

Abstract: Brain imaging analysis is vital for diagnosing and treating brain disorders,

analysis. However, current brain-oriented visual question-answering (VQA)
benchmarks either cover a few imaging modalities or are limited to
coarse-grained pathological descriptions, hindering a comprehensive assessment
of MLLMs throughout the full clinical continuum. To address these, we introduce
OmniBrainBench, the first comprehensive multimodal VQA benchmark specifically
designed to assess the multimodal comprehension capabilities of MLLMs in brain
imaging analysis.OmniBrainBench consists of 15 distinct brain imaging
modalities collected from 30 verified medical sources, yielding 9,527 validated
VQA pairs and 31,706 images. It simulates clinical workflows and encompasses 15
multi-stage clinical tasks rigorously validated by a professional radiologist.
Evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art models, including open-source, medical, and
proprietary MLLMs, highlights the substantial challenges posed by
OmniBrainBench. Our experiments reveal: (1) proprietary MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5)
beat open-source and medical models but lag physicians; (2) medical MLLMs vary
widely in performance; (3) open-source MLLMs trail overall but excel in
specific tasks; (4) MLLMs underperform sharply in complex preoperative tasks,
revealing a visual-to-clinical reasoning gap. OmniBrainBench sets a new
standard for evaluating and advancing MLLMs in brain imaging analysis,
highlighting gaps compared to expert clinical reasoning. We release it at

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian crossing intentions is crucial for the navigation of
mobile robots and intelligent vehicles. Although recent deep learning-based
models have shown significant success in forecasting intentions, few consider
incomplete observation under occlusion scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we
propose an Occlusion-Aware Diffusion Model (ODM) that reconstructs occluded
motion patterns and leverages them to guide future intention prediction. During
the denoising stage, we introduce an occlusion-aware diffusion transformer
architecture to estimate noise features associated with occluded patterns,
thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture contextual relationships in
occluded semantic scenarios. Furthermore, an occlusion mask-guided reverse
process is introduced to effectively utilize observation information, reducing
the accumulation of prediction errors and enhancing the accuracy of
reconstructed motion features. The performance of the proposed method under
various occlusion scenarios is comprehensively evaluated and compared with
existing methods on popular benchmarks, namely PIE and JAAD. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more robust
performance than existing methods in the literature.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, transparency in the decision-making of perception
models is critical, as even a single misperception can be catastrophic. Yet
with multi-sensor inputs, it is difficult to determine how each modality
contributes to a prediction because sensor information becomes entangled within
the fusion network. We introduce Layer-Wise Modality Decomposition (LMD), a
post-hoc, model-agnostic interpretability method that disentangles
modality-specific information across all layers of a pretrained fusion model.
To our knowledge, LMD is the first approach to attribute the predictions of a
perception model to individual input modalities in a sensor-fusion system for
autonomous driving. We evaluate LMD on pretrained fusion models under
camera-radar, camera-LiDAR, and camera-radar-LiDAR settings for autonomous
driving. Its effectiveness is validated using structured perturbation-based
metrics and modality-wise visual decompositions, demonstrating practical
applicability to interpreting high-capacity multimodal architectures. Code is

Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) enable direct location reasoning

through model collaboration but treat all agent interactions uniformly. They
lack mechanisms to handle conflicting predictions effectively. We propose
\textbf{GraphGeo}, a multi-agent debate framework using heterogeneous graph
neural networks for visual geo-localization. Our approach models diverse debate
relationships through typed edges, distinguishing supportive collaboration,
competitive argumentation, and knowledge transfer. We introduce a dual-level
debate mechanism combining node-level refinement and edge-level argumentation
modeling. A cross-level topology refinement strategy enables co-evolution
between graph structure and agent representations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate GraphGeo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. Our framework transforms cognitive conflicts between agents into
enhanced geo-localization accuracy through structured debate.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable

on empowering MLLMs with medical conversational abilities, which hold
significant promise for clinical applications. However, medical data presents
unique challenges due to its heterogeneous nature -- encompassing diverse
modalities including 2D images, 3D volumetric scans, and temporal video
sequences. The substantial domain gap and data format inconsistencies across
these modalities have hindered the development of unified medical MLLMs. To
address these challenges, we propose Fleming-VL, a unified end-to-end framework
for comprehensive medical visual understanding across heterogeneous modalities.
Fleming-VL tackles this problem from a data-centric perspective through three
key strategies: (1) scaling up pretraining by integrating long-context data
from both natural and medical-specific domains; (2) complementing fine-tuning
with rare medical data, including holistic video analysis and underrepresented
2D modalities such as ultrasound and dermoscopy images; (3) extending existing
evaluation frameworks to incorporate 3D volumetric and video understanding
benchmarks. Through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and group relative policy
optimization (GRPO), we develop Fleming-VL in multiple model scales. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Fleming-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple benchmarks, including medical VQA, video QA, and 3D medical
image understanding. We publicly release Fleming-VL to promote transparent,
reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI.

includes a CLIP text encoder and a ViT for extracting textual and visual
tokens, (ii) a Cross-modal Multi-level Weighting Module that produces an
alignment weight list by the local and global aggregation blocks to measure the
aligning quality of sketch and image samples, (iii) a Weighted Quadruplet Loss
Module aiming to improve the balance of domains in the triplet loss.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Sketchy, TU-Berlin, and

incorporating reference images to enhance try-on accuracy. Most existing
virtual try-on approaches rely on complex inputs such as agnostic person
images, human pose, densepose, or body keypoints, making them labor-intensive
and impractical for real-world applications. In contrast, EVTAR adopts a
two-stage training strategy, enabling simple inference with only the source
image and the target garment inputs. Our model generates try-on results without
masks, densepose, or segmentation maps. Moreover, EVTAR leverages additional
reference images of different individuals wearing the same clothes to preserve
garment texture and fine-grained details better. This mechanism is analogous to
how humans consider reference models when choosing outfits, thereby simulating
a more realistic and high-quality dressing effect. We enrich the training data
with supplementary references and unpaired person images to support these
capabilities. We evaluate EVTAR on two widely used benchmarks and diverse
tasks, and the results consistently validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Most video-anomaly research stops at frame-wise detection, offering little
insight into why an event is abnormal, typically outputting only frame-wise
anomaly scores without spatial or semantic context. Recent video anomaly
localization and video anomaly understanding methods improve explainability but
remain data-dependent and task-specific. We propose a unified reasoning
framework that bridges the gap between temporal detection, spatial
localization, and textual explanation. Our approach is built upon a chained
test-time reasoning process that sequentially connects these tasks, enabling
holistic zero-shot anomaly analysis without any additional training.
Specifically, our approach leverages intra-task reasoning to refine temporal
detections and inter-task chaining for spatial and semantic understanding,
yielding improved interpretability and generalization in a fully zero-shot
manner. Without any additional data or gradients, our method achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across multiple video anomaly detection,
localization, and explanation benchmarks. The results demonstrate that careful
prompt design with task-wise chaining can unlock the reasoning power of
foundation models, enabling practical, interpretable video anomaly analysis in
a fully zero-shot manner. Project Page:

Abstract: Accurate vessel segmentation is critical for clinical applications such as

Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown promise in generic segmentation, they
perform sub-optimally on vascular structures. In this work, we present VesSAM,
a powerful and efficient framework tailored for 2D vessel segmentation. VesSAM
integrates (1) a convolutional adapter to enhance local texture features, (2) a
multi-prompt encoder that fuses anatomical prompts, including skeletons,
bifurcation points, and segment midpoints, via hierarchical cross-attention,
and (3) a lightweight mask decoder to reduce jagged artifacts. We also
introduce an automated pipeline to generate structured multi-prompt
annotations, and curate a diverse benchmark dataset spanning 8 datasets across
5 imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that VesSAM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT-based SAM variants by over 10% Dice and 13%
IoU, and achieves competitive performance compared to fully fine-tuned methods,
with significantly fewer parameters. VesSAM also generalizes well to
out-of-distribution (OoD) settings, outperforming all baselines in average OoD

Abstract: Data denoising is a persistent challenge across scientific and engineering
domains. Real-world data is frequently corrupted by complex, non-linear noise,
rendering traditional rule-based denoising methods inadequate. To overcome
these obstacles, we propose a novel self-supervised multimodal iterative
denoising (MID) framework. MID models the collected noisy data as a state
within a continuous process of non-linear noise accumulation. By iteratively
introducing further noise, MID learns two neural networks: one to estimate the
current noise step and another to predict and subtract the corresponding noise
increment. For complex non-linear contamination, MID employs a first-order
Taylor expansion to locally linearize the noise process, enabling effective
iterative removal. Crucially, MID does not require paired clean-noisy datasets,
as it learns noise characteristics directly from the noisy inputs. Experiments
across four classic computer vision tasks demonstrate MID's robustness,
adaptability, and consistent state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, MID
exhibits strong performance and adaptability in tasks within the biomedical and
bioinformatics domains.

Abstract: Art authentication of Francisco Goya's works presents complex computational
challenges due to his heterogeneous stylistic evolution and extensive
historical patterns of forgery. We introduce a novel multimodal machine
learning framework that applies identical feature extraction techniques to both
visual and X-ray radiographic images of Goya paintings. The unified feature
extraction pipeline incorporates Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix descriptors,
Local Binary Patterns, entropy measures, energy calculations, and colour
distribution analysis applied consistently across both imaging modalities. The
extracted features from both visual and X-ray images are processed through an
optimised One-Class Support Vector Machine with hyperparameter tuning. Using a
dataset of 24 authenticated Goya paintings with corresponding X-ray images,
split into an 80/20 train-test configuration with 10-fold cross-validation, the
framework achieves 97.8% classification accuracy with a 0.022 false positive
rate. Case study analysis of ``Un Gigante'' demonstrates the practical efficacy
of our pipeline, achieving 92.3% authentication confidence through unified
multimodal feature analysis. Our results indicate substantial performance
improvement over single-modal approaches, establishing the effectiveness of
applying identical computational methods to both visual and radiographic
imagery in art authentication applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: B-mode ultrasound for breast cancer diagnosis faces challenges: speckle,
operator dependency, and indistinct boundaries. Existing deep learning suffers
from single-task learning, architectural constraints (CNNs lack global context,
Transformers local features), and black-box decision-making. These gaps hinder
clinical adoption.
  We propose HyFormer-Net, a hybrid CNN-Transformer for simultaneous
segmentation and classification with intrinsic interpretability. Its
dual-branch encoder integrates EfficientNet-B3 and Swin Transformer via
multi-scale hierarchical fusion blocks. An attention-gated decoder provides
precision and explainability. We introduce dual-pipeline interpretability: (1)
intrinsic attention validation with quantitative IoU verification (mean: 0.86),
and (2) Grad-CAM for classification reasoning.
  On the BUSI dataset, HyFormer-Net achieves Dice Score 0.761 +/- 0.072 and
accuracy 93.2%, outperforming U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet. Malignant
Recall of 92.1 +/- 2.2% ensures minimal false negatives. Ensemble modeling
yields exceptional Dice 90.2%, accuracy 99.5%, and perfect 100% Malignant
Recall, eliminating false negatives. Ablation studies confirm multi-scale
fusion contributes +16.8% Dice and attention gates add +5.9%.
  Crucially, we conduct the first cross-dataset generalization study for hybrid
CNN-Transformers in breast ultrasound. Zero-shot transfer fails (Dice: 0.058),
confirming domain shift. However, progressive fine-tuning with only 10%
target-domain data (68 images) recovers 92.5% performance. With 50% data, our
model achieves 77.3% Dice, exceeding source-domain performance (76.1%) and
demonstrating true generalization.

Abstract: We present FastBoost, a parameter-efficient neural architecture that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR benchmarks through a novel Dynamically
Scaled Progressive Attention (DSPA) mechanism. Our design establishes new
efficiency frontiers with: CIFAR-10: 95.57% accuracy (0.85M parameters) and
93.80% (0.37M parameters) CIFAR-100: 81.37% accuracy (0.92M parameters) and
74.85% (0.44M parameters) The breakthrough stems from three fundamental
innovations in DSPA: (1) Adaptive Fusion: Learnt channel-spatial attention
blending with dynamic weights. (2) Phase Scaling: Training-stage-aware
intensity modulation (from 0.5 to 1.0). (3) Residual Adaptation: Self-optimized
skip connections (gamma from 0.5 to 0.72). By integrating DSPA with enhanced
MBConv blocks, FastBoost achieves a 2.1 times parameter reduction over
MobileNetV3 while improving accuracy by +3.2 percentage points on CIFAR-10. The
architecture features dual attention pathways with real-time weight adjustment,
cascaded refinement layers (increasing gradient flow by 12.7%), and a
hardware-friendly design (0.28G FLOPs). This co-optimization of dynamic
attention and efficient convolution operations demonstrates unprecedented
parameter-accuracy trade-offs, enabling deployment in resource-constrained edge
devices without accuracy degradation.

Abstract: Neural image compression (NIC) has become the state-of-the-art for
rate-distortion performance, yet its security vulnerabilities remain
significantly less understood than those of classifiers. Existing adversarial
attacks on NICs are often naive adaptations of pixel-space methods, overlooking
the unique, structured nature of the compression pipeline. In this work, we
propose a more advanced class of vulnerabilities by introducing T-MLA, the
first targeted multiscale log--exponential attack framework. Our approach
crafts adversarial perturbations in the wavelet domain by directly targeting
the quality of the attacked and reconstructed images. This allows for a
principled, offline attack where perturbations are strategically confined to
specific wavelet subbands, maximizing distortion while ensuring perceptual
stealth. Extensive evaluation across multiple state-of-the-art NIC
architectures on standard image compression benchmarks reveals a large drop in
reconstruction quality while the perturbations remain visually imperceptible.
Our findings reveal a critical security flaw at the core of generative and
content delivery pipelines.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of determining an image's geographic origin,
poses significant challenges, largely due to visual similarities across
disparate locations and the large search space. To address these issues, we
propose a hierarchical sequence prediction approach inspired by how humans
narrow down locations from broad regions to specific addresses. Analogously,
our model predicts geographic tokens hierarchically, first identifying a
general region and then sequentially refining predictions to increasingly
precise locations. Rather than relying on explicit semantic partitions, our
method uses S2 cells, a nested, multiresolution global grid, and sequentially
predicts finer-level cells conditioned on visual inputs and previous
predictions. This procedure mirrors autoregressive text generation in large
language models. Much like in language modeling, final performance depends not
only on training but also on inference-time strategy. We investigate multiple
top-down traversal methods for autoregressive sampling, incorporating
techniques from test-time compute scaling used in language models.
Specifically, we integrate beam search and multi-sample inference while
exploring various selection strategies to determine the final output. This
enables the model to manage uncertainty by exploring multiple plausible paths
through the hierarchy. We evaluate our method on the Im2GPS3k and YFCC4k
datasets against two distinct sets of baselines: those that operate without a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and those that leverage one. In the
MLLM-free setting, our model surpasses other comparable baselines on nearly all
metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance with accuracy gains of up to
13.9%. When augmented with an MLLM, our model outperforms all baselines,
setting a new state-of-the-art across all metrics. The source code is available

Abstract: The emergence of 5G and 6G networks has established network slicing as a
significant part of future service-oriented architectures, demanding refined
identification methods supported by robust datasets. The article presents
SliceVision-F2I, a dataset of synthetic samples for studying feature
visualization in network slicing for next-generation networking systems. The
dataset transforms multivariate Key Performance Indicator (KPI) vectors into
visual representations through four distinct encoding methods: physically
inspired mappings, Perlin noise, neural wallpapering, and fractal branching.
For each encoding method, 30,000 samples are generated, each comprising a raw
KPI vector and a corresponding RGB image at low-resolution pixels. The dataset
simulates realistic and noisy network conditions to reflect operational
uncertainties and measurement imperfections. SliceVision-F2I is suitable for
tasks involving visual learning, network state classification, anomaly
detection, and benchmarking of image-based machine learning techniques applied
to network data. The dataset is publicly available and can be reused in various
research contexts, including multivariate time series analysis, synthetic data
generation, and feature-to-image transformations.

Abstract: This study presents a novel method for diagnosing respiratory diseases using

(EKDE) with a bimodal logistic regression classifier in a
statistical-model-based learning scheme. EKDE's flexibility in modeling data
distributions without assuming specific shapes and its adaptability to pixel
intensity variations make it valuable for extracting key features from medical
images. The method was tested on 13808 randomly selected chest X-rays from the
COVID-19 Radiography Dataset, achieved an accuracy of 70.14%, a sensitivity of
59.26%, and a specificity of 74.18%, demonstrating moderate performance in
detecting respiratory disease while showing room for improvement in
sensitivity. While clinical expertise remains essential for further refining
the model, this study highlights the potential of EKDE-based approaches to
enhance diagnostic accuracy and reliability in medical imaging.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video transformers have recently demonstrated strong potential for
echocardiogram (echo) analysis, leveraging self-supervised pre-training and
flexible adaptation across diverse tasks. However, like other models operating
on videos, they are prone to learning spurious correlations from non-diagnostic
regions such as image backgrounds. To overcome this limitation, we propose the
Video Anatomically Constrained Transformer (ViACT), a novel framework that
integrates anatomical priors directly into the transformer architecture. ViACT
represents a deforming anatomical structure as a point set and encodes both its
spatial geometry and corresponding image patches into transformer tokens.
During pre-training, ViACT follows a masked autoencoding strategy that masks
and reconstructs only anatomical patches, enforcing that representation
learning is focused on the anatomical region. The pre-trained model can then be
fine-tuned for tasks localized to this region. In this work we focus on the
myocardium, demonstrating the framework on echo analysis tasks such as left
ventricular ejection fraction (EF) regression and cardiac amyloidosis (CA)
detection. The anatomical constraint focuses transformer attention within the
myocardium, yielding interpretable attention maps aligned with regions of known
CA pathology. Moreover, ViACT generalizes to myocardium point tracking without
requiring task-specific components such as correlation volumes used in
specialized tracking networks.

Abstract: Computer vision applications, especially those using augmented reality

application is known as presenting significant demands regarding resources. In
order to enable its utilization in devices with more modest resources, edge

This work proposes the use of embedded devices with graphics processing units

attain a performance gain when compared to using only CPUs, which guarantee a

Abstract: Human-interpretable predictions are essential for deploying AI in medical
imaging, yet most interpretable-by-design (IBD) frameworks require concept
annotations for training data, which are costly and impractical to obtain in
clinical contexts. Recent attempts to bypass annotation, such as zero-shot
vision-language models or concept-generation frameworks, struggle to capture
domain-specific medical features, leading to poor reliability. In this paper,
we propose a novel Prior-guided Concept Predictor (PCP), a weakly supervised
framework that enables concept answer prediction without explicit supervision
or reliance on language models. PCP leverages class-level concept priors as
weak supervision and incorporates a refinement mechanism with KL divergence and
entropy regularization to align predictions with clinical reasoning.
Experiments on PH2 (dermoscopy) and WBCatt (hematology) show that PCP improves
concept-level F1-score by over 33% compared to zero-shot baselines, while
delivering competitive classification performance on four medical datasets
(PH2, WBCatt, HAM10000, and CXR4) relative to fully supervised concept
bottleneck models (CBMs) and V-IP.

attains markedly higher robustness compared with circularly padded CNNs and
plain CNNs. These results demonstrate that enforcing categorical symmetries

Abstract: Early and accurate segmentation of colorectal polyps is critical for reducing
colorectal cancer mortality, which has been extensively explored by academia
and industry. However, current deep learning-based polyp segmentation models
either compromise clinical decision-making by providing ambiguous polyp margins
in segmentation outputs or rely on heavy architectures with high computational
complexity, resulting in insufficient inference speeds for real-time colorectal
endoscopic applications. To address this problem, we propose MicroAUNet, a
light-weighted attention-based segmentation network that combines
depthwise-separable dilated convolutions with a single-path, parameter-shared
channel-spatial attention block to strengthen multi-scale boundary features. On
the basis of it, a progressive two-stage knowledge-distillation scheme is
introduced to transfer semantic and boundary cues from a high-capacity teacher.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks also demonstrate the state-of-the-art
accuracy under extremely low model complexity, indicating that MicroAUNet is
suitable for real-time clinical polyp segmentation. The code is publicly

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
seamlessly unifying text and image understanding and generation. However,
prevailing evaluations treat these abilities in isolation, such that tasks with
multimodal inputs and outputs are scored primarily through unimodal reasoning,
i.e., textual benchmarks emphasize language-based reasoning, while visual
benchmarks emphasize reasoning outcomes manifested in the pixels. We introduce
ROVER to address this pressing need to test reciprocal cross-modal reasoning,
the use of one modality to guide, verify, or refine outputs in the other, an
ability central to the vision of unified multimodal intelligence. ROVER is a
human-annotated benchmark that explicitly targets reciprocal cross-modal
reasoning, which contains 1312 tasks grounded in 1876 images, spanning two
complementary settings. Verbally-augmented reasoning for visual generation
evaluates whether models can use verbal prompts and reasoning chains to guide
faithful image synthesis. Visually-augmented reasoning for verbal generation
evaluates whether models can generate intermediate visualizations that
strengthen their own reasoning processes for question answering. Experiments on
17 unified models reveal two key findings: (i) Cross-modal reasoning determines
visual generation quality, with interleaved models significantly outperforming
non-interleaved ones; notably, combining strong unimodal models fails to
achieve comparable reasoning. (ii) Models show dissociation between physical
and symbolic reasoning: they succeed at interpreting perceptual concepts
literally but fail to construct visual abstractions for symbolic tasks, where
faulty reasoning harms performance. These results highlight reciprocal
cross-modal reasoning as a critical frontier for enabling true omnimodal
generation.

Abstract: Computer vision for animals holds great promise for wildlife research but
often depends on large-scale data, while existing collection methods rely on
controlled capture setups. Recent data-driven approaches show the potential of
single-view, non-invasive analysis, yet current animal video datasets are
limited--offering as few as 2.4K 15-frame clips and lacking key processing for
animal-centric 3D/4D tasks. We introduce an automated pipeline that mines
YouTube videos and processes them into object-centric clips, along with
auxiliary annotations valuable for downstream tasks like pose estimation,
tracking, and 3D/4D reconstruction. Using this pipeline, we amass 30K videos
(2M frames)--an order of magnitude more than prior works. To demonstrate its
utility, we focus on the 4D quadruped animal reconstruction task. To support
this task, we present Animal-in-Motion (AiM), a benchmark of 230 manually
filtered sequences with 11K frames showcasing clean, diverse animal motions. We
evaluate state-of-the-art model-based and model-free methods on
Animal-in-Motion, finding that 2D metrics favor the former despite unrealistic
3D shapes, while the latter yields more natural reconstructions but scores
lower--revealing a gap in current evaluation. To address this, we enhance a
recent model-free approach with sequence-level optimization, establishing the
first 4D animal reconstruction baseline. Together, our pipeline, benchmark, and
baseline aim to advance large-scale, markerless 4D animal reconstruction and
related tasks from in-the-wild videos. Code and datasets are available at

Abstract: Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) has been widely explored to enhance the
performance of image superresolution (SR). Despite some DWT-based methods
improving SR by capturing fine-grained frequency signals, most existing
approaches neglect the interrelations among multiscale frequency sub-bands,
resulting in inconsistencies and unnatural artifacts in the reconstructed
images. To address this challenge, we propose a Diffusion Transformer model
based on image Wavelet spectra for SR (DTWSR).DTWSR incorporates the
superiority of diffusion models and transformers to capture the interrelations
among multiscale frequency sub-bands, leading to a more consistence and
realistic SR image. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Discrete Wavelet
Transform (MDWT) to decompose images into wavelet spectra. A pyramid
tokenization method is proposed which embeds the spectra into a sequence of
tokens for transformer model, facilitating to capture features from both
spatial and frequency domain. A dual-decoder is designed elaborately to handle
the distinct variances in lowfrequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) sub-bands,
without omitting their alignment in image generation. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, with
high performance on both perception quality and fidelity.

Abstract: We introduce MoSa, a novel hierarchical motion generation framework for
text-driven 3D human motion generation that enhances the Vector
Quantization-guided Generative Transformers (VQ-GT) paradigm through a
coarse-to-fine scalable generation process. In MoSa, we propose a Multi-scale
Token Preservation Strategy (MTPS) integrated into a hierarchical residual
vector quantization variational autoencoder (RQ-VAE). MTPS employs
interpolation at each hierarchical quantization to effectively retain
coarse-to-fine multi-scale tokens. With this, the generative transformer
supports Scalable Autoregressive (SAR) modeling, which predicts scale tokens,
unlike traditional methods that predict only one token at each step.
Consequently, MoSa requires only 10 inference steps, matching the number of
RQ-VAE quantization layers. To address potential reconstruction degradation
from frequent interpolation, we propose CAQ-VAE, a lightweight yet expressive
convolution-attention hybrid VQ-VAE. CAQ-VAE enhances residual block design and
incorporates attention mechanisms to better capture global dependencies.
Extensive experiments show that MoSa achieves state-of-the-art generation
quality and efficiency, outperforming prior methods in both fidelity and speed.
On the Motion-X dataset, MoSa achieves an FID of 0.06 (versus MoMask's 0.20)
while reducing inference time by 27 percent. Moreover, MoSa generalizes well to
downstream tasks such as motion editing, requiring no additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have shown strong generalization for

most existing models rely solely on RGB cameras, limiting their perception and,
consequently, manipulation capabilities. We present OmniVLA, an omni-modality
VLA model that integrates novel sensing modalities for physically-grounded
spatial intelligence beyond RGB perception. The core of our approach is the
sensor-masked image, a unified representation that overlays spatially grounded
and physically meaningful masks onto the RGB images, derived from sensors
including an infrared camera, a mmWave radar, and a microphone array. This
image-native unification keeps sensor input close to RGB statistics to
facilitate training, provides a uniform interface across sensor hardware, and
enables data-efficient learning with lightweight per-sensor projectors. Built
on this, we present a multisensory vision-language-action model architecture
and train the model based on an RGB-pretrained VLA backbone. We evaluate
OmniVLA on challenging real-world tasks where sensor-modality perception is
needed to guide the manipulation. OmniVLA achieves an average task success rate
of 84%, significantly outperforms both RGB-only and raw-sensor-input baseline
models by 59% and 28% respectively, meanwhile showing higher learning
efficiency and stronger generalization capability.

Abstract: The immense diversity in the culture and culinary of Indian cuisines calls
attention to the major shortcoming of the existing Visual Question
Answering(VQA) systems which are inclined towards the foods from Western
region. Recent attempt towards building a VQA dataset for Indian food is a step
towards addressing this challenge. However, their approach towards VQA follows
a two-step process in which the answer is generated first, followed by the
explanation of the expected answer. In this work, we claim that food VQA
requires to follow a multi-step reasoning process to arrive at an accurate
answer, especially in the context of India food, which involves understanding
complex culinary context and identifying relationships between various food
items. With this hypothesis we create reasoning chains upon the QA with minimal
human intervention. We fine-tune smaller LLMs and VLMs with auto-validated
reasoning chains and further train them using reinforcement learning with
larger data. With augmentation of reasoning chains, we observed accuracy
improvement of an average 10 percentage points on the baseline. We provide
detailed analysis in terms the effect of addition of reasoning chains for the
Indian Food VQA task.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is required for automated driving models to generalize well
across diverse road conditions. This paper explores a training method for
domain adaptation to adapt PilotNet, an end-to-end deep learning-based model,
for left-hand driving conditions using real-world Australian highway data. Four
training methods were evaluated: (1) a baseline model trained on U.S.
right-hand driving data, (2) a model trained on flipped U.S. data, (3) a model
pretrained on U.S. data and then fine-tuned on Australian highways, and (4) a
model pretrained on flipped U.S. data and then finetuned on Australian
highways. This setup examines whether incorporating flipped data enhances the
model adaptation by providing an initial left-hand driving alignment. The paper
compares model performance regarding steering prediction accuracy and
attention, using saliency-based analysis to measure attention shifts across
significant road regions. Results show that pretraining on flipped data alone
worsens prediction stability due to misaligned feature representations, but
significantly improves adaptation when followed by fine-tuning, leading to
lower prediction error and stronger focus on left-side cues. To validate this
approach across different architectures, the same experiments were done on
ResNet, which confirmed similar adaptation trends. These findings emphasize the
importance of preprocessing techniques, such as flipped-data pretraining,
followed by fine-tuning to improve model adaptation with minimal retraining

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We review human evaluation practices in automated, speech-driven 3D gesture
generation and find a lack of standardisation and frequent use of flawed
experimental setups. This leads to a situation where it is impossible to know
how different methods compare, or what the state of the art is. In order to
address common shortcomings of evaluation design, and to standardise future
user studies in gesture-generation works, we introduce a detailed human
evaluation protocol for the widely-used BEAT2 motion-capture dataset. Using
this protocol, we conduct large-scale crowdsourced evaluation to rank six
recent gesture-generation models -- each trained by its original authors --
across two key evaluation dimensions: motion realism and speech-gesture
alignment. Our results provide strong evidence that 1) newer models do not
consistently outperform earlier approaches; 2) published claims of high motion
realism or speech-gesture alignment may not hold up under rigorous evaluation;
and 3) the field must adopt disentangled assessments of motion quality and
multimodal alignment for accurate benchmarking in order to make progress.
Finally, in order to drive standardisation and enable new evaluation research,
we will release five hours of synthetic motion from the benchmarked models;
over 750 rendered video stimuli from the user studies -- enabling new
evaluations without model reimplementation required -- alongside our
open-source rendering script, and the 16,000 pairwise human preference votes
collected for our benchmark.

Abstract: Human gaze offers rich supervisory signals for understanding visual attention
in complex visual environments. In this paper, we propose Eyes on Target, a
novel depth-aware and gaze-guided object detection framework designed for
egocentric videos. Our approach injects gaze-derived features into the
attention mechanism of a Vision Transformer (ViT), effectively biasing spatial
feature selection toward human-attended regions. Unlike traditional object
detectors that treat all regions equally, our method emphasises
viewer-prioritised areas to enhance object detection. We validate our method on
an egocentric simulator dataset where human visual attention is critical for
task assessment, illustrating its potential in evaluating human performance in
simulation scenarios. We evaluate the effectiveness of our gaze-integrated
model through extensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent gains in detection accuracy over gaze-agnostic baselines on both the
custom simulator dataset and public benchmarks, including Ego4D Ego-Motion and
Ego-CH-Gaze datasets. To interpret model behaviour, we also introduce a
gaze-aware attention head importance metric, revealing how gaze cues modulate
transformer attention dynamics.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transferable attacks generate adversarial examples on surrogate models to
fool unknown victim models, posing real-world threats and growing research
interest. Despite focusing on flat losses for transferable adversarial
examples, recent studies still fall into suboptimal regions, especially the
flat-yet-sharp areas, termed as deceptive flatness. In this paper, we introduce
a novel black-box gradient-based transferable attack from a perspective of
dual-order information. Specifically, we feasibly propose Adversarial Flatness
(AF) to the deceptive flatness problem and a theoretical assurance for
adversarial transferability. Based on this, using an efficient approximation of
our objective, we instantiate our attack as Adversarial Flatness Attack (AFA),
addressing the altered gradient sign issue. Additionally, to further improve
the attack ability, we devise MonteCarlo Adversarial Sampling (MCAS) by
enhancing the inner-loop sampling efficiency. The comprehensive results on
ImageNet-compatible dataset demonstrate superiority over six baselines,
generating adversarial examples in flatter regions and boosting transferability
across model architectures. When tested on input transformation attacks or the
Baidu Cloud API, our method outperforms baselines.

Abstract: Brain lesion segmentation remains challenging due to small, low-contrast
lesions, anisotropic sampling, and cross-slice discontinuities. We propose
CenterMamba-SAM, an end-to-end framework that freezes a pretrained backbone and
trains only lightweight adapters for efficient fine-tuning. At its core is the
CenterMamba encoder, which employs a novel 3x3 corner-axis-center
short-sequence scanning strategy to enable center-prioritized, axis-reinforced,
and diagonally compensated information aggregation. This design enhances
sensitivity to weak boundaries and tiny foci while maintaining sparse yet
effective feature representation. A memory-driven structural prompt generator
maintains a prototype bank across neighboring slices, enabling automatic
synthesis of reliable prompts without user interaction, thereby improving
inter-slice coherence. The memory-augmented multi-scale decoder integrates
memory attention modules at multiple levels, combining deep supervision with
progressive refinement to restore fine details while preserving global
consistency. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that
CenterMamba-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in brain lesion
segmentation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation degrades in adverse weather because refraction,
scattering, and point dropouts corrupt geometry. Prior work in weather
simulation, mixing-based augmentation, domain randomization, and uncertainty or
boundary regularization improves robustness but still overlooks structural
vulnerabilities near boundaries, corners, and sparse regions. We present a
Light Geometry-aware adapter. The module aligns azimuth and applies horizontal
circular padding to preserve neighbor continuity across the 0~360 degree
wrap-around boundary. A local-window K-Nearest Neighbors gathers nearby points
and computes simple local statistics, which are compressed into compact
geometry-aware cues. During training, these cues drive region-aware
regularization that stabilizes predictions in structurally fragile areas. The
adapter is plug and play, complements augmentation, and can be enabled only
during training with negligible inference cost. We adopt a source-only
cross-weather setup where models train on SemanticKITTI and are evaluated on
SemanticSTF without target labels or fine-tuning. The adapter improves mIoU by
7.9 percentage points over the data-centric augmentation baseline and by 0.6
points over the class-centric regularization baseline. These results indicate
that geometry-driven regularization is a key direction for all-weather LiDAR
segmentation.

Abstract: Current motion-conditioned video generation methods suffer from prohibitive
latency (minutes per video) and non-causal processing that prevents real-time
interaction. We present MotionStream, enabling sub-second latency with up to 29
FPS streaming generation on a single GPU. Our approach begins by augmenting a
text-to-video model with motion control, which generates high-quality videos
that adhere to the global text prompt and local motion guidance, but does not
perform inference on the fly. As such, we distill this bidirectional teacher
into a causal student through Self Forcing with Distribution Matching
Distillation, enabling real-time streaming inference. Several key challenges
arise when generating videos of long, potentially infinite time-horizons: (1)
bridging the domain gap from training on finite length and extrapolating to
infinite horizons, (2) sustaining high quality by preventing error
accumulation, and (3) maintaining fast inference, without incurring growth in
computational cost due to increasing context windows. A key to our approach is
introducing carefully designed sliding-window causal attention, combined with
attention sinks. By incorporating self-rollout with attention sinks and KV
cache rolling during training, we properly simulate inference-time
extrapolations with a fixed context window, enabling constant-speed generation
of arbitrarily long videos. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results in
motion following and video quality while being two orders of magnitude faster,
uniquely enabling infinite-length streaming. With MotionStream, users can paint
trajectories, control cameras, or transfer motion, and see results unfold in
real-time, delivering a truly interactive experience.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ancient Chinese paintings are a valuable cultural heritage that is damaged by
irreversible color degradation. Reviving color-degraded paintings is
extraordinarily difficult due to the complex chemistry mechanism. Progress is
further slowed by the lack of comprehensive, high-quality datasets, which
hampers the creation of end-to-end digital restoration tools. To revive colors,
we propose PRevivor, a prior-guided color transformer that learns from recent
paintings (e.g., Ming and Qing Dynasty) to restore ancient ones (e.g., Tang and
Song Dynasty). To develop PRevivor, we decompose color restoration into two
sequential sub-tasks: luminance enhancement and hue correction. For luminance
enhancement, we employ two variational U-Nets and a multi-scale mapping module
to translate faded luminance into restored counterparts. For hue correction, we
design a dual-branch color query module guided by localized hue priors
extracted from faded paintings. Specifically, one branch focuses attention on
regions guided by masked priors, enforcing localized hue correction, whereas
the other branch remains unconstrained to maintain a global reasoning
capability. To evaluate PRevivor, we conduct extensive experiments against
state-of-the-art colorization methods. The results demonstrate superior
performance both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm in medical
image analysis, offering the potential to provide generalizable, task-agnostic
solutions across a wide range of clinical tasks and imaging modalities. Their
capacity to learn transferable representations from large-scale data has the
potential to address the limitations of conventional task-specific models.
However, adaptation of FMs to real-world clinical practice remains constrained
by key challenges, including domain shifts, limited availability of
high-quality annotated data, substantial computational demands, and strict
privacy requirements. This review presents a comprehensive assessment of
strategies for adapting FMs to the specific demands of medical imaging. We
examine approaches such as supervised fine-tuning, domain-specific pretraining,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning, self-supervised learning, hybrid methods, and
multimodal or cross-modal frameworks. For each, we evaluate reported
performance gains, clinical applicability, and limitations, while identifying
trade-offs and unresolved challenges that prior reviews have often overlooked.
Beyond these established techniques, we also highlight emerging directions
aimed at addressing current gaps. These include continual learning to enable
dynamic deployment, federated and privacy-preserving approaches to safeguard
sensitive data, hybrid self-supervised learning to enhance data efficiency,
data-centric pipelines that combine synthetic generation with human-in-the-loop
validation, and systematic benchmarking to assess robust generalization under
real-world clinical variability. By outlining these strategies and associated
research gaps, this review provides a roadmap for developing adaptive,
trustworthy, and clinically integrated FMs capable of meeting the demands of
real-world medical imaging.

Abstract: The increasing realism of generated images has raised significant concerns
about their potential misuse, necessitating robust detection methods. Current
approaches mainly rely on training binary classifiers, which depend heavily on
the quantity and quality of available generated images. In this work, we
propose a novel framework that exploits geometric differences between the data
manifolds of natural and generated images. To exploit this difference, we
employ a pair of functions engineered to yield consistent outputs for natural
images but divergent outputs for generated ones, leveraging the property that
their gradients reside in mutually orthogonal subspaces. This design enables a
simple yet effective detection method: an image is identified as generated if a
transformation along its data manifold induces a significant change in the loss
value of a self-supervised model pre-trained on natural images. Further more,
to address diminishing manifold disparities in advanced generative models, we
leverage normalizing flows to amplify detectable differences by extruding
generated images away from the natural image manifold. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of this method. Code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal generative models have driven substantial
improvements in image editing. However, current generative models still
struggle with handling diverse and complex image editing tasks that require
implicit reasoning, underscoring the need for a comprehensive benchmark to
systematically assess their performance across various reasoning scenarios.
Existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-object attribute transformation
in realistic scenarios, which, while effective, encounter two key challenges:
(1) they largely overlook multi-object interactions as well as game-world
scenarios that involve human-defined rules, which are common in real-life
applications; (2) they only rely on textual references to evaluate the
generated images, potentially leading to systematic misjudgments, especially in
complex reasoning scenarios. To this end, this work proposes UniREditBench, a
unified benchmark for reasoning-based image editing evaluation. It comprises
2,700 meticulously curated samples, covering both real- and game-world
scenarios across 8 primary dimensions and 18 sub-dimensions. To improve
evaluation reliability, we introduce multimodal dual-reference evaluation,
providing both textual and ground-truth image references for each sample
assessment. Furthermore, we design an automated multi-scenario data synthesis
pipeline and construct UniREdit-Data-100K, a large-scale synthetic dataset with
high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning annotations. We fine-tune Bagel
on this dataset and develop UniREdit-Bagel, demonstrating substantial
improvements in both in-domain and out-of-distribution settings. Through
thorough benchmarking of both open-source and closed-source image editing
models, we reveal their strengths and weaknesses across various aspects.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of gastric content from ultrasound is critical for
stratifying aspiration risk at induction of general anesthesia. However,
traditional methods rely on manual tracing of gastric antra and empirical
formulas, which face significant limitations in both efficiency and accuracy.
To address these challenges, a novel two-stage probability map-guided
dual-branch fusion framework (REASON) for gastric content assessment is
proposed. In stage 1, a segmentation model generates probability maps that
suppress artifacts and highlight gastric anatomy. In stage 2, a dual-branch
classifier fuses information from two standard views, right lateral decubitus
(RLD) and supine (SUP), to improve the discrimination of learned features.
Experimental results on a self-collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches by a significant
margin. This framework shows great promise for automated preoperative
aspiration risk assessment, offering a more robust, efficient, and accurate
solution for clinical practice.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has been widely used for representing

entanglements among instances limit its representation and interpretability. To
address these challenges, we propose a latent factor grouping-boosted
cluster-reasoning instance disentangled learning framework for whole-slide
image (WSI) interpretable representation in three phases. First, we introduce a
novel positive semi-definite latent factor grouping that maps instances into a
latent subspace, effectively mitigating spatial entanglement in MIL. To
alleviate semantic entanglement, we employs instance probability counterfactual
inference and optimization via cluster-reasoning instance disentangling.
Finally, we employ a generalized linear weighted decision via instance effect
re-weighting to address decision entanglement. Extensive experiments on
multicentre datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms all
state-of-the-art models. Moreover, it attains pathologist-aligned
interpretability through disentangled representations and a transparent
decision-making process.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality synthesis of
specific subjects, such as identities or objects. This capability, while
unlocking new possibilities in content creation, also introduces significant
privacy risks, as personalization techniques can be misused by malicious users
to generate unauthorized content. Although several studies have attempted to
counter this by generating adversarially perturbed samples designed to disrupt
personalization, they rely on unrealistic assumptions and become ineffective in
the presence of even a few clean images or under simple image transformations.
To address these challenges, we shift the protection target from the images to
the diffusion model itself to hinder the personalization of specific subjects,
through our novel framework called Anti-Personalized Diffusion Models (APDM).
We first provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that a naive approach of
existing loss functions to diffusion models is inherently incapable of ensuring
convergence for robust anti-personalization. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce Direct Protective Optimization (DPO), a novel loss function that
effectively disrupts subject personalization in the target model without
compromising generative quality. Moreover, we propose a new dual-path
optimization strategy, coined Learning to Protect (L2P). By alternating between
personalization and protection paths, L2P simulates future personalization
trajectories and adaptively reinforces protection at each step. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in preventing unauthorized personalization. The
code is available at https://github.com/KU-VGI/APDM.

Abstract: Robust feature representations are essential for learning-based Multi-View
Stereo (MVS), which relies on accurate feature matching. Recent MVS methods
leverage Transformers to capture long-range dependencies based on local
features extracted by conventional feature pyramid networks. However, the
quadratic complexity of Transformer-based MVS methods poses challenges to
balance performance and efficiency. Motivated by the global modeling capability
and linear complexity of the Mamba architecture, we propose MVSMamba, the first
Mamba-based MVS network. MVSMamba enables efficient global feature aggregation
with minimal computational overhead. To fully exploit Mamba's potential in MVS,
we propose a Dynamic Mamba module (DM-module) based on a novel
reference-centered dynamic scanning strategy, which enables: (1) Efficient
intra- and inter-view feature interaction from the reference to source views,
(2) Omnidirectional multi-view feature representations, and (3) Multi-scale
global feature aggregation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate MVSMamba
outperforms state-of-the-art MVS methods on the DTU dataset and the
Tanks-and-Temples benchmark with both superior performance and efficiency. The

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has brought about powerful models that can

However, adversarial attacks, an unnoticed alteration, can deceive models,
leading to inaccurate predictions. In this paper, a generative adversarial
attack method is proposed that uses the CLIP model to create highly effective
and visually imperceptible adversarial perturbations. The CLIP model's ability
to align text and image representation helps incorporate natural language
semantics with a guided loss to generate effective adversarial examples that
look identical to the original inputs. This integration allows extensive scene
manipulation, creating perturbations in multi-object environments specifically
designed to deceive multilabel classifiers. Our approach integrates the
concentrated perturbation strategy from Saliency-based Auto-Encoder (SSAE) with
the dissimilar text embeddings similar to Generative Adversarial Multi-Object
Scene Attacks (GAMA), resulting in perturbations that both deceive
classification models and maintain high structural similarity to the original
images. The model was tested on various tasks across diverse black-box victim
models. The experimental results show that our method performs competitively,
achieving comparable or superior results to existing techniques, while
preserving greater visual fidelity.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of medical images is fundamental to tumor diagnosis and
treatment planning. SAM-based interactive segmentation has gained attention for
its strong generalization, but most methods follow a
single-point-to-single-object paradigm, which limits multi-lesion segmentation.
Moreover, ViT backbones capture global context but often miss high-fidelity
local details. We propose MIQ-SAM3D, a multi-instance 3D segmentation framework
with a competitive query optimization strategy that shifts from
single-point-to-single-mask to single-point-to-multi-instance. A
prompt-conditioned instance-query generator transforms a single point prompt
into multiple specialized queries, enabling retrieval of all semantically
similar lesions across the 3D volume from a single exemplar. A hybrid
CNN-Transformer encoder injects CNN-derived boundary saliency into ViT
self-attention via spatial gating. A competitively optimized query decoder then
enables end-to-end, parallel, multi-instance prediction through inter-query
competition. On LiTS17 and KiTS21 dataset, MIQ-SAM3D achieved comparable levels
and exhibits strong robustness to prompts, providing a practical solution for
efficient annotation of clinically relevant multi-lesion cases.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing

Abstract: Medical visual question answering (Med-VQA) is a crucial multimodal task in
clinical decision support and telemedicine. Recent self-attention based methods
struggle to effectively handle cross-modal semantic alignments between vision
and language. Moreover, classification-based methods rely on predefined answer
sets. Treating this task as a simple classification problem may make it unable
to adapt to the diversity of free-form answers and overlook the detailed
semantic information of free-form answers. In order to tackle these challenges,
we introduce a Cross-Mamba Interaction based Multi-Task Learning (CMI-MTL)
framework that learns cross-modal feature representations from images and
texts. CMI-MTL comprises three key modules: fine-grained visual-text feature
alignment (FVTA), cross-modal interleaved feature representation (CIFR), and
free-form answer-enhanced multi-task learning (FFAE). FVTA extracts the most
relevant regions in image-text pairs through fine-grained visual-text feature

Abstract: The underwater domain presents a vast array of challenges for roboticists and
computer vision researchers alike, such as poor lighting conditions and high
dynamic range scenes. In these adverse conditions, traditional vision
techniques struggle to adapt and lead to suboptimal performance. Event-based
cameras present an attractive solution to this problem, mitigating the issues
of traditional cameras by tracking changes in the footage on a frame-by-frame
basis. In this paper, we introduce a pipeline which can be used to generate
realistic synthetic data of an event-based camera mounted to an AUV (Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle) in an underwater environment for training vision models. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline using the task of rock detection
with poor visibility and suspended particulate matter, but the approach can be
generalized to other underwater tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Fine-grained cross-modal alignment aims to establish precise local
correspondences between vision and language, forming a cornerstone for visual
question answering and related multimodal applications. Current approaches face
challenges in addressing patch redundancy and ambiguity, which arise from the
inherent information density disparities across modalities. Recently,
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as promising solutions to
bridge this gap through their robust semantic generation capabilities. However,
the dense textual outputs from MLLMs may introduce conflicts with the original
sparse captions. Furthermore, accurately quantifying semantic relevance between
rich visual patches and concise textual descriptions remains a core challenge.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Semantic-Enhanced Patch
Slimming (SEPS) framework, which systematically addresses patch redundancy and
ambiguity. Our approach employs a two-stage mechanism to integrate unified
semantics from both dense and sparse texts, enabling the identification of
salient visual patches. Additionally, it leverages relevance-aware selection
with mean value computation to highlight crucial patch-word correspondences,
thereby improving cross-modal similarity assessment. Comprehensive experiments
on Flickr30K and MS-COCO datasets validate that SEPS achieves superior
performance, surpassing existing approaches by 23\%-86\% in rSum across diverse
model architectures, with notable enhancements in text-to-image retrieval
scenarios. Our implementation is available at

Abstract: Inventory management of firefighting assets is crucial for emergency

methods are inefficient due to limited capabilities in automated asset
recognition and reconstruction. To address the challenge, this research
introduces the Fire-ART dataset and develops a panoramic image-based
reconstruction approach for semantic enrichment of firefighting assets into BIM
models. The Fire-ART dataset covers 15 fundamental assets, comprising 2,626
images and 6,627 instances, making it an extensive and publicly accessible
dataset for asset recognition. In addition, the reconstruction approach
integrates modified cube-map conversion and radius-based spherical camera
projection to enhance recognition and localization accuracy. Through
validations with two real-world case studies, the proposed approach achieves
F1-scores of 73% and 88% and localization errors of 0.620 and 0.428 meters,
respectively. The Fire-ART dataset and the reconstruction approach offer
valuable resources and robust technical solutions to enhance the accurate
digital management of fire safety equipment.

Abstract: Faithful yet compact explanations for vision models remain a challenge, as
commonly used dense perturbation masks are often fragmented and overfitted,
needing careful post-processing. Here, we present a training-free explanation
method that replaces dense masks with smooth tunable contours. A star-convex
region is parameterized by a truncated Fourier series and optimized under an
extremal preserve/delete objective using the classifier gradients. The approach
guarantees a single, simply connected mask, cuts the number of free parameters
by orders of magnitude, and yields stable boundary updates without cleanup.
Restricting solutions to low-dimensional, smooth contours makes the method
robust to adversarial masking artifacts. On ImageNet classifiers, it matches
the extremal fidelity of dense masks while producing compact, interpretable
regions with improved run-to-run consistency. Explicit area control also
enables importance contour maps, yielding a transparent fidelity-area profiles.
Finally, we extend the approach to multi-contour and show how it can localize
multiple objects within the same framework. Across benchmarks, the method
achieves higher relevance mass and lower complexity than gradient and
perturbation based baselines, with especially strong gains on self-supervised
DINO models where it improves relevance mass by over 15% and maintains positive
faithfulness correlations.

Abstract: Recent hybrid video generation models combine autoregressive temporal
dynamics with diffusion-based spatial denoising, but their sequential,
iterative nature leads to error accumulation and long inference times. In this
work, we propose a distillation-based framework for efficient causal video
generation that enables high-quality synthesis with extremely limited denoising
steps. Our approach builds upon the Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD)
framework and proposes a novel Adversarial Self-Distillation (ASD) strategy,
which aligns the outputs of the student model's n-step denoising process with
its (n+1)-step version at the distribution level. This design provides smoother
supervision by bridging small intra-student gaps and more informative guidance
by combining teacher knowledge with locally consistent student behavior,
substantially improving training stability and generation quality in extremely
few-step scenarios (e.g., 1-2 steps). In addition, we present a First-Frame
Enhancement (FFE) strategy, which allocates more denoising steps to the initial
frames to mitigate error propagation while applying larger skipping steps to
later frames. Extensive experiments on VBench demonstrate that our method
surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in both one-step and two-step video
generation. Notably, our framework produces a single distilled model that
flexibly supports multiple inference-step settings, eliminating the need for
repeated re-distillation and enabling efficient, high-quality video synthesis.

Abstract: Single object tracking aims to localize target object with specific reference
modalities (bounding box, natural language or both) in a sequence of specific
video modalities (RGB, RGB+Depth, RGB+Thermal or RGB+Event.). Different
reference modalities enable various human-machine interactions, and different
video modalities are demanded in complex scenarios to enhance tracking
robustness. Existing trackers are designed for single or several video
modalities with single or several reference modalities, which leads to separate
model designs and limits practical applications. Practically, a unified tracker
is needed to handle various requirements. To the best of our knowledge, there
is still no tracker that can perform tracking with these above reference
modalities across these video modalities simultaneously. Thus, in this paper,
we present a unified tracker, UniSOT, for different combinations of three
reference modalities and four video modalities with uniform parameters.
Extensive experimental results on 18 visual tracking, vision-language tracking
and RGB+X tracking benchmarks demonstrate that UniSOT shows superior
performance against modality-specific counterparts. Notably, UniSOT outperforms
previous counterparts by over 3.0\% AUC on TNL2K across all three reference
modalities and outperforms Un-Track by over 2.0\% main metric across all three
RGB+X video modalities.

Abstract: Off-road semantic segmentation suffers from thick, inconsistent boundaries,
sparse supervision for rare classes, and pervasive label noise. Designs that
fuse only at low resolution blur edges and propagate local errors, whereas
maintaining high-resolution pathways or repeating high-resolution fusions is
costly and fragile to noise. We introduce a resolutionaware token decoder that
balances global semantics, local consistency, and boundary fidelity under
imperfect supervision. Most computation occurs at a low-resolution bottleneck;
a gated cross-attention injects fine-scale detail, and only a sparse,
uncertainty-selected set of pixels is refined. The components are co-designed
and tightly integrated: global self-attention with lightweight dilated
depthwise refinement restores local coherence; a gated cross-attention
integrates fine-scale features from a standard high-resolution encoder stream
without amplifying noise; and a class-aware point refinement corrects residual
ambiguities with negligible overhead. During training, we add a boundary-band
consistency regularizer that encourages coherent predictions in a thin
neighborhood around annotated edges, with no inference-time cost. Overall, the
results indicate competitive performance and improved stability across
transitions.

Abstract: Robust perception at night remains challenging for thermal-infrared
detection: low contrast and weak high-frequency cues lead to duplicate,
overlapping boxes, missed small objects, and class confusion. Prior remedies
either translate TIR to RGB and hope pixel fidelity transfers to detection --
making performance fragile to color or structure artifacts -- or fuse RGB and
TIR at test time, which requires extra sensors, precise calibration, and higher
runtime cost. Both lines can help in favorable conditions, but do not directly
shape the thermal representation used by the detector. We keep mono-modality
inference and tackle the root causes during training. Specifically, we
introduce training-only objectives that sharpen instance-level decision
boundaries by pulling together features of the same class and pushing apart
those of different classes -- suppressing duplicate and confusing detections --
and that inject cross-modal semantic priors by aligning the student's
multi-level pyramid features with an RGB-trained teacher, thereby strengthening
texture-poor thermal features without visible input at test time. In
experiments, our method outperformed prior approaches and achieved
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: To effectively manage the wastage of perishable fruits, it is crucial to
accurately predict their freshness or shelf life using non-invasive methods
that rely on visual data. In this regard, deep learning techniques can offer a
viable solution. However, obtaining fine-grained fruit freshness labels from
experts is costly, leading to a scarcity of data. Closed proprietary Vision
Language Models (VLMs), such as Gemini, have demonstrated strong performance in
fruit freshness detection task in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.
Nonetheless, food retail organizations are unable to utilize these proprietary
models due to concerns related to data privacy, while existing open-source VLMs
yield sub-optimal performance for the task. Fine-tuning these open-source
models with limited data fails to achieve the performance levels of proprietary
models. In this work, we introduce a Model-Agnostic Ordinal Meta-Learning
(MAOML) algorithm, designed to train smaller VLMs. This approach utilizes
meta-learning to address data sparsity and leverages label ordinality, thereby
achieving state-of-the-art performance in the fruit freshness classification
task under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our method achieves an
industry-standard accuracy of 92.71%, averaged across all fruits.

Abstract: Recent studies have identified Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) as an

However, existing methods largely follow image-domain paradigms and are mainly
developed on small-scale models (approximately 2B parameters), limiting their
ability to address the unique challenges of video tasks, such as costly data
construction, unstable training, and heavy memory consumption. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce a GT-Pair that automatically builds
high-quality preference pairs by using real videos as positives and
model-generated videos as negatives, eliminating the need for any external
annotation. We further present Reg-DPO, which incorporates the SFT loss as a
regularization term into the DPO objective to enhance training stability and
generation fidelity. Additionally, by combining the FSDP framework with
multiple memory optimization techniques, our approach achieves nearly three
times higher training capacity than using FSDP alone. Extensive experiments on
both I2V and T2V tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches, delivering superior video
generation quality.

Abstract: Safety and reliability are essential for deploying Visual Question Answering
(VQA) in surgery, where incorrect or ambiguous responses can harm the patient.
Most surgical VQA research focuses on accuracy or linguistic quality while
overlooking safety behaviors such as ambiguity awareness, referral to human
experts, or triggering a second opinion. Inspired by Automatic Failure
Detection (AFD), we study uncertainty estimation as a key enabler of safer
decision making. We introduce Question Aligned Semantic Nearest Neighbor
Entropy (QA-SNNE), a black box uncertainty estimator that incorporates question
semantics into prediction confidence. It measures semantic entropy by comparing
generated answers with nearest neighbors in a medical text embedding space,
conditioned on the question. We evaluate five models, including domain specific
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuned (PEFT) models and zero-shot Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), on EndoVis18-VQA and PitVQA. PEFT models
degrade under mild paraphrasing, while LVLMs are more resilient. Across three
LVLMs and two PEFT baselines, QA-SNNE improves AUROC in most in-template
settings and enhances hallucination detection. The Area Under the ROC Curve
(AUROC) increases by 15-38% for zero-shot models, with gains maintained under
out-of-template stress. QA-SNNE offers a practical and interpretable step
toward AFD in surgical VQA by linking semantic uncertainty to question context.
Combining LVLM backbones with question aligned uncertainty estimation can
improve safety and clinician trust. The code and model are available at

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) for vision transformers (ViTs) has garnered
significant attention due to its efficiency in compressing models. However,
existing methods typically overlook the relationship between a well-trained NN
and the quantized model, leading to considerable quantization error for PTQ.
However, it is unclear how to efficiently train a model-agnostic neural network
which is tailored for a predefined precision low-bit model. In this paper, we
firstly discover that a flat full precision neural network is crucial for
low-bit quantization. To achieve this, we propose a framework that proactively
pre-conditions the model by measuring and disentangling the error sources.
Specifically, both the Activation Quantization Error (AQE) and the Weight
Quantization Error (WQE) are statistically modeled as independent Gaussian
noises. We study several noise injection optimization methods to obtain a flat
minimum. Experimental results attest to the effectiveness of our approach.
These results open novel pathways for obtaining low-bit PTQ models.

Abstract: The expansion of instruction-tuning data has enabled foundation language
models to exhibit improved instruction adherence and superior performance
across diverse downstream tasks. Semantically-rich 3D human motion is being
progressively integrated with these foundation models to enhance multimodal
understanding and cross-modal generation capabilities. However, the modality
gap between human motion and text raises unresolved concerns about catastrophic
forgetting during this integration. In addition, developing
autoregressive-compatible pose representations that preserve generalizability
across heterogeneous downstream tasks remains a critical technical barrier. To
address these issues, we propose the Human Motion-Vision-Language Model
(HMVLM), a unified framework based on the Mixture of Expert Low-Rank
Adaption(MoE LoRA) strategy. The framework leverages the gating network to
dynamically allocate LoRA expert weights based on the input prompt, enabling
synchronized fine-tuning of multiple tasks. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting
during instruction-tuning, we introduce a novel zero expert that preserves the
pre-trained parameters for general linguistic tasks. For pose representation,
we implement body-part-specific tokenization by partitioning the human body
into different joint groups, enhancing the spatial resolution of the
representation. Experiments show that our method effectively alleviates
knowledge forgetting during instruction-tuning and achieves remarkable
performance across diverse human motion downstream tasks.

Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for semantic communication, delivering significant performance gains over
conventional separate coding schemes. However, existing JSCC frameworks remain
vulnerable to physical-layer adversarial threats, such as pilot spoofing and
subcarrier jamming, compromising semantic fidelity. In this paper, we propose
SecDiff, a plug-and-play, diffusion-aided decoding framework that significantly
enhances the security and robustness of deep JSCC under adversarial wireless
environments. Different from prior diffusion-guided JSCC methods that suffer
from high inference latency, SecDiff employs pseudoinverse-guided sampling and
adaptive guidance weighting, enabling flexible step-size control and efficient
semantic reconstruction. To counter jamming attacks, we introduce a power-based
subcarrier masking strategy and recast recovery as a masked inpainting problem,
solved via diffusion guidance. For pilot spoofing, we formulate channel
estimation as a blind inverse problem and develop an expectation-minimization
(EM)-driven reconstruction algorithm, guided jointly by reconstruction loss and
a channel operator. Notably, our method alternates between pilot recovery and
channel estimation, enabling joint refinement of both variables throughout the
diffusion process. Extensive experiments over orthogonal frequency-division
multiplexing (OFDM) channels under adversarial conditions show that SecDiff
outperforms existing secure and generative JSCC baselines by achieving a
favorable trade-off between reconstruction quality and computational cost. This
balance makes SecDiff a promising step toward practical, low-latency, and
attack-resilient semantic communications.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental problem in robotics and computer
vision, yet it remains challenging due to partial observability, occlusions,
and object symmetries, which inevitably lead to pose ambiguity and multiple
hypotheses consistent with the same observation. While deterministic deep
networks achieve impressive performance under well-constrained conditions, they
are often overconfident and fail to capture the multi-modality of the
underlying pose distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
probabilistic framework that leverages flow matching on the SE(3) manifold for
estimating 6D object pose distributions. Unlike existing methods that regress a
single deterministic output, our approach models the full pose distribution
with a sample-based estimate and enables reasoning about uncertainty in
ambiguous cases such as symmetric objects or severe occlusions. We achieve
state-of-the-art results on Real275, YCB-V, and LM-O, and demonstrate how our
sample-based pose estimates can be leveraged in downstream robotic manipulation
tasks such as active perception for disambiguating uncertain viewpoints or
guiding grasp synthesis in an uncertainty-aware manner.

Abstract: Unsupervised learning of depth and ego-motion, two fundamental 3D perception
tasks, has made significant strides in recent years. However, most methods
treat ego-motion as an auxiliary task, either mixing all motion types or
excluding depth-independent rotational motions in supervision. Such designs
limit the incorporation of strong geometric constraints, reducing reliability
and robustness under diverse conditions. This study introduces a discriminative
treatment of motion components, leveraging the geometric regularities of their
respective rigid flows to benefit both depth and ego-motion estimation. Given
consecutive video frames, network outputs first align the optical axes and
imaging planes of the source and target cameras. Optical flows between frames
are transformed through these alignments, and deviations are quantified to
impose geometric constraints individually on each ego-motion component,
enabling more targeted refinement. These alignments further reformulate the
joint learning process into coaxial and coplanar forms, where depth and each
translation component can be mutually derived through closed-form geometric
relationships, introducing complementary constraints that improve depth
robustness. DiMoDE, a general depth and ego-motion joint learning framework
incorporating these designs, achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple
public datasets and a newly collected diverse real-world dataset, particularly
under challenging conditions. Our source code will be publicly available at

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) faces persistent challenges in balancing
reconstruction fidelity with cross-scenario generalization. While existing
methods predominantly focus on deterministic pixel-level mappings between
paired low/normal-light images, they often neglect the continuous physical
process of luminance transitions in real-world environments, leading to
performance drop when normal-light references are unavailable. Inspired by
empirical analysis of natural luminance dynamics revealing power-law
distributed intensity transitions, this paper introduces Luminance-Aware
Statistical Quantification (LASQ), a novel framework that reformulates LLIE as
a statistical sampling process over hierarchical luminance distributions. Our
LASQ re-conceptualizes luminance transition as a power-law distribution in
intensity coordinate space that can be approximated by stratified power
functions, therefore, replacing deterministic mappings with probabilistic
sampling over continuous luminance layers. A diffusion forward process is
designed to autonomously discover optimal transition paths between luminance
layers, achieving unsupervised distribution emulation without normal-light
references. In this way, it considerably improves the performance in practical
situations, enabling more adaptable and versatile light restoration. This
framework is also readily applicable to cases with normal-light references,
where it achieves superior performance on domain-specific datasets alongside
better generalization-ability across non-reference datasets.

local characteristics. These include various effects that change the surface
appearance of materials, such as stains, tears, holes, abrasions,
discoloration, and more. Such alterations are ubiquitous in nature, and
including them in the synthesis process is crucial for generating realistic

blemishes, adopting a learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled
examples. Our approach does not require manual annotations by the user;
instead, it detects the appearance-altering features through unsupervised
anomaly detection. The various textural features are then automatically
clustered into semantically coherent groups, which are used to guide the
conditional generation of images. Our pipeline as a whole goes from a small
image collection to a versatile generative model that enables the user to
interactively create and paint features on textures of arbitrary size. Notably,
the algorithms we introduce for diffusion-based editing and infinite stationary
texture generation are generic and should prove useful in other contexts as
well. Project page: https://reality.tf.fau.de/pub/ardelean2025examplebased.html

work, we present a novel contrastive learning framework to improve the
stylization capability of large text-to-image diffusion models. Motivated by
the astonishing advance in image generation models that makes synthetic data an
intrinsic part of model training in various computer vision tasks, we exploit
synthetic image generation in our approach. Usually, the generated synthetic
data is dependent on the task, and most of the time it is used to enlarge the
available real training dataset. With NSYNC, alternatively, we focus on
generating negative synthetic sets to be used in a novel contrastive training
scheme along with real positive images. In our proposed training setup, we
forward negative data along with positive data and obtain negative and positive
gradients, respectively. We then refine the positive gradient by subtracting
its projection onto the negative gradient to get the orthogonal component,
based on which the parameters are updated. This orthogonal component eliminates
the trivial attributes that are present in both positive and negative data and
directs the model towards capturing a more unique style. Experiments on various
styles of painters and illustrators show that our approach improves the
performance over the baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Rare and challenging driving scenarios are critical for autonomous vehicle
development. Since they are difficult to encounter, simulating or generating
them using generative models is a popular approach. Following previous efforts
to structure driving scenario representations in a layer model, we propose a
structured five-layer model to improve the evaluation and generation of rare
scenarios. We use this model alongside large foundational models to generate
new driving scenarios using a data augmentation strategy. Unlike previous
representations, our structure introduces subclasses and characteristics for
every agent of the scenario, allowing us to compare them using an embedding
specific to our layer-model. We study and adapt two metrics to evaluate the
relevance of a synthetic dataset in the context of a structured representation:
the diversity score estimates how different the scenarios of a dataset are from
one another, while the originality score calculates how similar a synthetic
dataset is from a real reference set. This paper showcases both metrics in
different generation setup, as well as a qualitative evaluation of synthetic
videos generated from structured scenario descriptions. The code and extended
results can be found at https://github.com/Valgiz/5LMSG.

Abstract: Occluded pedestrian re-identification (ReID) in base station environments is
a critical task in computer vision, particularly for surveillance and security
applications. This task faces numerous challenges, as occlusions often obscure
key body features, increasing the complexity of identification. Traditional
ResNet-based ReID algorithms often fail to address occlusions effectively,
necessitating new ReID methods. We propose the PCD-ReID (Pedestrian Component
Discrepancy) algorithm to address these issues. The contributions of this work
are as follows: To tackle the occlusion problem, we design a Transformer-based
PCD network capable of extracting shared component features, such as helmets
and uniforms. To mitigate overfitting on public datasets, we collected new
real-world patrol surveillance images for model training, covering six months,
10,000 individuals, and over 50,000 images. Comparative experiments with
existing ReID algorithms demonstrate that our model achieves a mean Average
Precision (mAP) of 79.0% and a Rank-1 accuracy of 82.7%, marking a 15.9% Rank-1
improvement over ResNet50-based methods. Experimental evaluations indicate that
PCD-ReID effectively achieves occlusion-aware ReID performance for personnel in
tower inspection scenarios, highlighting its potential for practical deployment
in surveillance and security applications.

Abstract: AI tools can greatly enhance the analysis of organoid microscopy images, from
detection and segmentation to feature extraction and classification. However,
their limited accessibility to biologists without programming experience
remains a major barrier, resulting in labor-intensive and largely manual
workflows. Although a few AI models for organoid analysis have been developed,
most existing tools remain narrowly focused on specific tasks. In this work, we
introduce the Napari Organoid Analyzer (NOA), a general purpose graphical user
interface to simplify AI-based organoid analysis. NOA integrates modules for
detection, segmentation, tracking, feature extraction, custom feature
annotation and ML-based feature prediction. It interfaces multiple
state-of-the-art algorithms and is implemented as an open-source napari plugin
for maximal flexibility and extensibility. We demonstrate the versatility of
NOA through three case studies, involving the quantification of morphological
changes during organoid differentiation, assessment of phototoxicity effects,
and prediction of organoid viability and differentiation state. Together, these
examples illustrate how NOA enables comprehensive, AI-driven organoid image
analysis within an accessible and extensible framework.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) are emerging as powerful tools for
learning generalizable visuomotor control policies. However, current VLAs are
mostly trained on large-scale image-text-action data and remain limited in two
key ways: (i) they struggle with pixel-level scene understanding, and (ii) they
rely heavily on textual prompts, which reduces their flexibility in real-world
settings. To address these challenges, we introduce PixelVLA, the first VLA
model designed to support both pixel-level reasoning and multimodal prompting
with text and visual inputs. Our approach is built on a new visuomotor
instruction tuning framework that integrates a multiscale pixel-aware encoder
with a visual prompting encoder. To train PixelVLA effectively, we further
propose a two-stage automated annotation pipeline that generates Pixel-160K, a
large-scale dataset with pixel-level annotations derived from existing robot
data. Experiments on three standard VLA benchmarks and two VLA model variants
show that PixelVLA improves manipulation success rates by 10.1%-17.8% over
OpenVLA, while requiring only 1.5% of its pretraining cost. These results
demonstrate that PixelVLA can be integrated into existing VLAs to enable more
accurate, efficient, and versatile robot control in complex environments. The
dataset and code will be released as open source.

Abstract: Compared to traditional methods, Deep Learning (DL) becomes a key technology
for computer vision tasks. Synthetic data generation is an interesting use case
for DL, especially in the field of medical imaging such as Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI). The need for this task since the original MRI data is limited.
The generation of realistic medical images is completely difficult and
challenging. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are useful for creating
synthetic medical images. In this paper, we propose a DL based methodology for
creating synthetic MRI data using the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial
Network (DC-GAN) to address the problem of limited data. We also employ a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to classify the brain tumor using
synthetic data and real MRI data. CNN is used to evaluate the quality and
utility of the synthetic images. The classification result demonstrates
comparable performance on real and synthetic images, which validates the
effectiveness of GAN-generated images for downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The unification of understanding and generation within a single multi-modal
large model (MLLM) remains one significant challenge, largely due to the
dichotomy between continuous and discrete visual tokenizations. Continuous
tokenizer (CT) achieves strong performance by bridging multiple
independently-trained understanding modules and generation modules, but suffers
from complex multi-stage pipelines and substantial engineering overhead.
Conversely, discrete tokenizers (DT) offer a conceptually elegant idea by
quantizing each image into a primitive, but inevitably leading to information
loss and performance degradation. To resolve this tension, we question the
binary choice between CT and DT, inspired by the wave-particle duality of
light, and propose the Continuous-Discrete Dualistic Visual Tokenizer (CDD-VT).
We treat visual data as a flexible composition of image primitives derived from
quantized codebooks, with the crucial insight that the primitive number
assigned to each visual sample is adaptively determined according to its
complexity: simple instances use a few primitives, emulating discrete
tokenization, while complex instances use many, approximating continuous
tokenization. Two core components are designed: Diverse Quantitative
Primitives, which encourage primitives orthogonality to better populate
information space, and Dynamic Primitive Allocator, which assesses sample
complexity to determine the optimal set of primitives. Extensive experiments on
reconstruction, retrieval and classification show that CDD-VT achieves superior
performance over to specialized CT and DT, effectively getting strong result
within a concise and scalable MLLM.

Abstract: Accurate tumor size measurement is a cornerstone of evaluating cancer
treatment response. The most widely adopted standard for this purpose is the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1, which relies on
measuring the longest tumor diameter in a single plane. However, volumetric
measurements have been shown to provide a more reliable assessment of treatment
effect. Their clinical adoption has been limited, though, due to the
labor-intensive nature of manual volumetric annotation. In this paper, we
present Lite ENSAM, a lightweight adaptation of the ENSAM architecture designed
for efficient volumetric tumor segmentation from CT scans annotated with RECIST
annotations. Lite ENSAM was submitted to the MICCAI FLARE 2025 Task 1:
Pan-cancer Segmentation in CT Scans, Subtask 2, where it achieved a Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 60.7% and a Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) of

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have advanced representation learning through
self-supervised methods. However, existing training pipelines are often
inflexible, domain-specific, or computationally expensive, which limits their
usability across different domains and resource settings. DINO-MX is a modular
and extensible training framework that combines the core principles of DINO,
DINOv2 and DINOv3 within a unified configuration-driven system. It supports a
variety of transformer-based architectures and is fully compatible with the
Hugging Face ecosystem. The framework includes multiple training strategies
such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), layer freezing, and knowledge distillation,
along with support for distributed training through both Distributed Data
Parallel (DDP) and Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP). DINO-MX is designed to
work with both natural and specialized data types, including single- and
multi-channel images. Experimental results on diverse datasets show that
DINO-MX achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing
computational costs. Additionally, it offers interpretability tools and a
label-guided data augmentation method that improves attention-based
localization without the need for extra detection or segmentation heads.
DINO-MX provides a reproducible and scalable foundation for developing,
adapting, and benchmarking self-supervised vision models across a range of

Abstract: Progress in anatomical 3D shape classification is limited by the complexity
of mesh data and the lack of standardized benchmarks, highlighting the need for
robust learning methods and reproducible evaluation. We introduce two key steps
toward clinically and benchmark-ready anatomical shape classification via
self-supervised graph autoencoding. We propose Precomputed Structural Pooling
(PSPooling), a non-learnable mesh pooling operator designed for efficient and
structure-preserving graph coarsening in 3D anatomical shape analysis.
PSPooling precomputes node correspondence sets based on geometric proximity,
enabling parallelizable and reversible pooling and unpooling operations with
guaranteed support structure. This design avoids the sparsity and
reconstruction issues of selection-based methods and the sequential overhead of
edge contraction approaches, making it particularly suitable for
high-resolution medical meshes. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we integrate
PSPooling into a self-supervised graph autoencoder that learns anatomy-aware
representations from unlabeled surface meshes. We evaluate the downstream
benefits on MedShapeNet19, a new curated benchmark dataset we derive from
MedShapeNet, consisting of 19 anatomical classes with standardized training,
validation, and test splits. Experiments show that PSPooling significantly
improves reconstruction fidelity and classification accuracy in low-label
regimes, establishing a strong baseline for medical 3D shape learning. We hope
that MedShapeNet19 will serve as a widely adopted benchmark for anatomical
shape classification and further research in medical 3D shape analysis. Access

Abstract: In the retrieval domain, candidates' fusion from heterogeneous retrievers is
a long-standing challenge, particularly for complex, multi-modal data such as
videos. While typical fusion techniques are training-free, they rely solely on
rank or score signals, disregarding candidates' representations. This work
introduces Vote-in-Context (ViC), a generalized, training-free framework that
re-thinks list-wise reranking and fusion as a zero-shot reasoning task for a
Vision-Language Model (VLM). The core insight is to serialize both content
evidence and retriever metadata directly within the VLM's prompt, allowing the
model to adaptively weigh retriever consensus against visual-linguistic
content. We demonstrate the generality of this framework by applying it to the
challenging domain of cross-modal video retrieval. To this end, we introduce
the S-Grid, a compact serialization map that represents each video as an image
grid, optionally paired with subtitles to enable list-wise reasoning over video
candidates. ViC is evaluated both as a single-list reranker, where it
dramatically improves the precision of individual retrievers, and as an
ensemble fuser, where it consistently outperforms strong baselines like
CombSUM. Across video retrieval benchmarks including ActivityNet and VATEX, the
framework establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot retrieval performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex visual and temporal signals
alongside text. In zero-shot settings, ViC achieves Recall@1 scores of 87.1%
(t2v) / 89.0% (v2t) on MSR-VTT and 99.6% (v2t) on VATEX, representing massive
gains of up to +40 Recall@1 over previous state-of-the-art baselines. We
present ViC as a simple, reproducible, and highly effective recipe for turning
modern VLMs into powerful zero-shot rerankers and fusers. Code and resources

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have

application to complex 3D reasoning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether
these models can effectively capture the detailed spatial information required
for robust real-world performance, especially cross-view consistency, a key
requirement for accurate 3D reasoning. Considering this issue, we introduce
Viewpoint Learning, a task designed to evaluate and improve the spatial
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. We present the Viewpoint-100K dataset,
consisting of 100K object-centric image pairs with diverse viewpoints and
corresponding question-answer pairs. Our approach employs a two-stage
fine-tuning strategy: first, foundational knowledge is injected to the baseline
MLLM via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on Viewpoint-100K, resulting in
significant improvements across multiple tasks; second, generalization is
enhanced through Reinforcement Learning using the Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) algorithm on a broader set of questions. Additionally, we
introduce a hybrid cold-start initialization method designed to simultaneously
learn viewpoint representations and maintain coherent reasoning thinking.
Experimental results show that our approach significantly activates the spatial
reasoning ability of MLLM, improving performance on both in-domain and
out-of-domain reasoning tasks. Our findings highlight the value of developing
foundational spatial skills in MLLMs, supporting future progress in robotics,
autonomous systems, and 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently been incorporated into diffusion
models, e.g., tasks such as text-to-image. However, directly applying existing
RL methods to diffusion-based image restoration models is suboptimal, as the
objective of restoration fundamentally differs from that of pure generation: it
places greater emphasis on fidelity. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively integrate RL into diffusion-based restoration models. First,
through extensive experiments with various reward functions, we find that an
effective reward can be derived from an Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model,
instead of intuitive ground-truth-based supervision, which has already been
optimized during the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) stage prior to RL. Moreover,
our strategy focuses on using RL for challenging samples that are significantly
distant from the ground truth, and our RL approach is innovatively implemented
using MLLM-based IQA models to align distributions with high-quality images
initially. As the samples approach the ground truth's distribution, RL is
adaptively combined with SFT for more fine-grained alignment. This dynamic
process is facilitated through an automatic weighting strategy that adjusts
based on the relative difficulty of the training samples. Our strategy is
plug-and-play that can be seamlessly applied to diffusion-based restoration
models, boosting its performance across various restoration tasks. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed RL framework.

Abstract: Relighting is a crucial task with both practical demand and artistic value,
and recent diffusion models have shown strong potential by enabling rich and
controllable lighting effects. However, as they are typically optimized in
semantic latent space, where proximity does not guarantee physical correctness
in visual space, they often produce unrealistic results, such as overexposed
highlights, misaligned shadows, and incorrect occlusions. We address this with
UniLumos, a unified relighting framework for both images and videos that brings
RGB-space geometry feedback into a flow matching backbone. By supervising the
model with depth and normal maps extracted from its outputs, we explicitly
align lighting effects with the scene structure, enhancing physical
plausibility. Nevertheless, this feedback requires high-quality outputs for
supervision in visual space, making standard multi-step denoising
computationally expensive. To mitigate this, we employ path consistency
learning, allowing supervision to remain effective even under few-step training
regimes. To enable fine-grained relighting control and supervision, we design a
structured six-dimensional annotation protocol capturing core illumination
attributes. Building upon this, we propose LumosBench, a disentangled
attribute-level benchmark that evaluates lighting controllability via large
vision-language models, enabling automatic and interpretable assessment of
relighting precision across individual dimensions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that UniLumos achieves state-of-the-art relighting quality with
significantly improved physical consistency, while delivering a 20x speedup for
both image and video relighting. Code is available at

Abstract: Compared to hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC) not
only maintains the structural features of tissue samples, but also provides
high-resolution protein localization, which is essential for aiding in
pathology diagnosis. Despite its diagnostic value, IHC remains a costly and
labor-intensive technique. Its limited scalability and constraints in
multiplexing further hinder widespread adoption, especially in resource-limited
settings. Consequently, researchers are increasingly exploring computational
stain translation techniques to synthesize IHC-equivalent images from
H&E-stained slides, aiming to extract protein-level information more
efficiently and cost-effectively. However, most existing stain translation
techniques rely on a linearly weighted summation of multiple loss terms within
a single objective function, strategy that often overlooks the interdepedence
among these components-resulting in suboptimal image quality and an inability
to simultaneously preserve structural authenticity and color fidelity. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel network architecture that follows a
progressive structure, incorporating color and cell border generation logic,
which enables each visual aspect to be optimized in a stage-wise and decoupled
manner. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed network architecture, we
build upon the Adaptive Supervised PatchNCE (ASP) framework as our baseline. We
introduce additional loss functions based on 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
chromogen concentration and image gradient, enhancing color fidelity and cell
boundary clarity in the generated IHC images. By reconstructing the generation
pipeline using our structure-color-cell boundary progressive mechanism,
experiments on HER2 and ER datasets demonstrated that the model significantly
improved visual quality and achieved finer structural details.

quality. To alleviate this drawback, we propose Learnable Fractional

expressive power of neural networks with the interpretability of physical
modeling. Specifically, we implement a time-fractional reaction-diffusion
module that enables iterative depth refinement with dynamically generated
differential orders, capturing long-term dependencies. In addition, we
introduce an efficient continuous convolution operator via coefficient

Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously vulnerable to imperceptible
perturbations. Most existing research centers on adversarial robustness (AR),
which evaluates models under worst-case scenarios by examining the existence of
deterministic adversarial examples (AEs). In contrast, probabilistic robustness
(PR) adopts a statistical perspective, measuring the probability that
predictions remain correct under stochastic perturbations. While PR is widely
regarded as a practical complement to AR, dedicated training methods for
improving PR are still relatively underexplored, albeit with emerging progress.
Among the few PR-targeted training methods, we identify three limitations: i
non-comparable evaluation protocols; ii limited comparisons to strong AT
baselines despite anecdotal PR gains from AT; and iii no unified framework to
compare the generalization of these methods. Thus, we introduce PRBench, the
first benchmark dedicated to evaluating improvements in PR achieved by
different robustness training methods. PRBench empirically compares most common
AT and PR-targeted training methods using a comprehensive set of metrics,
including clean accuracy, PR and AR performance, training efficiency, and
generalization error (GE). We also provide theoretical analysis on the GE of PR
performance across different training methods. Main findings revealed by
PRBench include: AT methods are more versatile than PR-targeted training
methods in terms of improving both AR and PR performance across diverse
hyperparameter settings, while PR-targeted training methods consistently yield
lower GE and higher clean accuracy. A leaderboard comprising 222 trained models

that are used to complete tasks. Global strategies identify generalized sets of
actions used to complete tasks, while local strategies identify sequences that
used those sets of actions in a similar composition. Additionally, meaningful

Abstract: Pneumonia remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide,

transformer-based detectors like RT-DETR have shown promise in object detection
tasks, their application to medical imaging, particularly pneumonia detection
in chest X-rays, remains underexplored. This paper presents CGF-DETR, an

that replaces standard multi-head attention with dynamic gating mechanisms and
single-head self-attention. Additionally, GCFC3 is designed for the neck to
enhance feature representation through multi-path convolution fusion while
maintaining real-time performance via structural re-parameterization. Extensive
experiments on the RSNA Pneumonia Detection dataset demonstrate that CGF-DETR
achieves 82.2\% mAP@0.5, outperforming the baseline RT-DETR-l by 3.7\% while
maintaining comparable inference speed at 48.1 FPS. Our ablation studies

Abstract: Visual grounding in 3D is the key for embodied agents to localize
language-referred objects in open-world environments. However, existing
benchmarks are limited to indoor focus, single-platform constraints, and small
scale. We introduce 3EED, a multi-platform, multi-modal 3D grounding benchmark
featuring RGB and LiDAR data from vehicle, drone, and quadruped platforms. We
provide over 128,000 objects and 22,000 validated referring expressions across
diverse outdoor scenes -- 10x larger than existing datasets. We develop a
scalable annotation pipeline combining vision-language model prompting with
human verification to ensure high-quality spatial grounding. To support
cross-platform learning, we propose platform-aware normalization and
cross-modal alignment techniques, and establish benchmark protocols for
in-domain and cross-platform evaluations. Our findings reveal significant
performance gaps, highlighting the challenges and opportunities of
generalizable 3D grounding. The 3EED dataset and benchmark toolkit are released
to advance future research in language-driven 3D embodied perception.

Abstract: 2D-to-3D human pose lifting is a fundamental challenge for 3D human pose
estimation in monocular video, where graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and
attention mechanisms have proven to be inherently suitable for encoding the
spatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joints. However, depth ambiguity and
errors in 2D pose estimation lead to incoherence in the 3D trajectory. Previous
studies have attempted to restrict jitters in the time domain, for instance, by
constraining the differences between adjacent frames while neglecting the
global spatial-temporal correlations of skeletal joint motion. To tackle this
problem, we design HGFreNet, a novel GraphFormer architecture with hop-hybrid
feature aggregation and 3D trajectory consistency in the frequency domain.
Specifically, we propose a hop-hybrid graph attention (HGA) module and a
Transformer encoder to model global joint spatial-temporal correlations. The
HGA module groups all $k$-hop neighbors of a skeletal joint into a hybrid group
to enlarge the receptive field and applies the attention mechanism to discover
the latent correlations of these groups globally. We then exploit global
temporal correlations by constraining trajectory consistency in the frequency
domain. To provide 3D information for depth inference across frames and
maintain coherence over time, a preliminary network is applied to estimate the
3D pose. Extensive experiments were conducted on two standard benchmark
datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. The results demonstrate that the proposed
HGFreNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in terms of positional
accuracy and temporal consistency.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce \textbf{Wonder3D++}, a novel method for
efficiently generating high-fidelity textured meshes from single-view images.
Recent methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) have shown the
potential to recover 3D geometry from 2D diffusion priors, but they typically
suffer from time-consuming per-shape optimization and inconsistent geometry. In
contrast, certain works directly produce 3D information via fast network
inferences, but their results are often of low quality and lack geometric
details. To holistically improve the quality, consistency, and efficiency of
single-view reconstruction tasks, we propose a cross-domain diffusion model
that generates multi-view normal maps and the corresponding color images. To
ensure the consistency of generation, we employ a multi-view cross-domain
attention mechanism that facilitates information exchange across views and
modalities. Lastly, we introduce a cascaded 3D mesh extraction algorithm that
drives high-quality surfaces from the multi-view 2D representations in only
about $3$ minute in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality reconstruction results,
robust generalization, and good efficiency compared to prior works. Code

Abstract: Although transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various domains, their quadratic attention mechanisms introduce significant
computational overhead when processing long-sequence data. In this paper, we
present a unified autonomous driving model, UniLION, which efficiently handles
large-scale LiDAR point clouds, high-resolution multi-view images, and even
temporal sequences based on the linear group RNN operator (i.e., performs
linear RNN for grouped features). Remarkably, UniLION serves as a single
versatile architecture that can seamlessly support multiple specialized
variants (i.e., LiDAR-only, temporal LiDAR, multi-modal, and multi-modal
temporal fusion configurations) without requiring explicit temporal or
multi-modal fusion modules. Moreover, UniLION consistently delivers competitive
and even state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of core tasks,
including 3D perception (e.g., 3D object detection, 3D object tracking, 3D
occupancy prediction, BEV map segmentation), prediction (e.g., motion
prediction), and planning (e.g., end-to-end planning). This unified paradigm
naturally simplifies the design of multi-modal and multi-task autonomous
driving systems while maintaining superior performance. Ultimately, we hope
UniLION offers a fresh perspective on the development of 3D foundation models
in autonomous driving. Code is available at

Abstract: Foundation models in video generation are demonstrating remarkable
capabilities as potential world models for simulating the physical world.
However, their application in high-stakes domains like surgery, which demand
deep, specialized causal knowledge rather than general physical rules, remains
a critical unexplored gap. To systematically address this challenge, we present
SurgVeo, the first expert-curated benchmark for video generation model
evaluation in surgery, and the Surgical Plausibility Pyramid (SPP), a novel,
four-tiered framework tailored to assess model outputs from basic appearance to
complex surgical strategy. On the basis of the SurgVeo benchmark, we task the
advanced Veo-3 model with a zero-shot prediction task on surgical clips from
laparoscopic and neurosurgical procedures. A panel of four board-certified
surgeons evaluates the generated videos according to the SPP. Our results
reveal a distinct "plausibility gap": while Veo-3 achieves exceptional Visual
Perceptual Plausibility, it fails critically at higher levels of the SPP,
including Instrument Operation Plausibility, Environment Feedback Plausibility,
and Surgical Intent Plausibility. This work provides the first quantitative
evidence of the chasm between visually convincing mimicry and causal
understanding in surgical AI. Our findings from SurgVeo and the SPP establish a
crucial foundation and roadmap for developing future models capable of
navigating the complexities of specialized, real-world healthcare domains.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a robust framework for
enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge. Recent advances
in RAG have investigated graph based retrieval for intricate reasoning;
however, the influence of prompt design on enhancing the retrieval and
reasoning process is still considerably under-examined. In this paper, we
present a prompt-driven GraphRAG framework that underscores the significance of
prompt formulation in facilitating entity extraction, fact selection, and
passage reranking for multi-hop question answering. Our approach creates a
symbolic knowledge graph from text data by encoding entities and factual
relationships as structured facts triples. We use LLMs selectively during
online retrieval to perform semantic filtering and answer generation. We also
use entity-guided graph traversal through Personalized PageRank (PPR) to
support efficient, scalable retrieval based on the knowledge graph we built.
Our system gets state-of-the-art performance on HotpotQA and 2WikiMultiHopQA,
with F1 scores of 80.7% and 78.9%, and Recall@5 scores of 97.1% and 98.1%,
respectively. These results show that prompt design is an important part of
improving retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research lays the
groundwork for more efficient and comprehensible multi-hop question-answering
systems, highlighting the importance of prompt-aware graph reasoning.

Abstract: The ability to connect visual patterns with the processes that form them
represents one of the deepest forms of visual understanding. Textures of clouds
and waves, the growth of cities and forests, or the formation of materials and
landscapes are all examples of patterns emerging from underlying mechanisms. We
present the Scitextures dataset, a large-scale collection of textures and
visual patterns from all domains of science, tech, and art, along with the
models and code that generate these images. Covering over 1,200 different
models and 100,000 images of patterns and textures from physics, chemistry,
biology, sociology, technology, mathematics, and art, this dataset offers a way
to explore the connection between the visual patterns that shape our world and
the mechanisms that produce them. Created by an agentic AI pipeline that
autonomously collects and implements models in standardized form, we use
SciTextures to evaluate the ability of leading AI models to link visual
patterns to the models and code that generate them, and to identify different
patterns that emerged from the same process. We also test AIs ability to infer
and recreate the mechanisms behind visual patterns by providing a natural image
of a real-world pattern and asking the AI to identify, model, and code the
mechanism that formed the pattern, then run this code to generate a simulated
image that is compared to the real image. These benchmarks show that
vision-language models (VLMs) can understand and simulate the physical system
beyond a visual pattern. The dataset and code are available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The frontier of visual reasoning is shifting toward models like OpenAI o3,
which can intelligently create and operate tools to transform images for
problem-solving, also known as thinking-\textit{with}-images in
chain-of-thought. Yet existing benchmarks fail to fully capture this advanced
capability. Even Visual Search, the most common benchmark for current
thinking-\textit{with}-images methods, tests only basic operations such as
localization and cropping, offering little insight into more complex, dynamic,
and tool-dependent reasoning. We introduce \textbf{TIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating agentic thinking-with-images across 13 diverse tasks,
each requiring novel tool use for image processing and manipulation in
chain-of-thought. We evaluate 22 multimodal large language models (MLLMs), from
leading open-sourced and proprietary models to those with explicit tool-use
augmentation. Results show that TIR-Bench is universally challenging, and
strong performance requires genuine thinking-with-images capabilities. Finally,
we present a pilot study comparing direct versus agentic fine-tuning.

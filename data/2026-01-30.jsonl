However, due to the subtle nature of articulatory gestures, existing lipreading methods often suffer from limited feature discriminability and poor generalization capabilities. To address these challenges, this paper delves into the purification of visual features from temporal, spatial, and channel dimensions. We propose a novel method named Multi-Attention Lipreading Network(MA-LipNet). The core of MA-LipNet lies in its sequential application of three dedicated attention modules. Firstly, a \\textit{Channel Attention (CA)} module is employed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise features, thereby mitigating interference from less informative channels. Subsequently, two spatio-temporal attention modules with distinct granularities-\\textit{Joint Spatial-Temporal Attention (JSTA)} and \\textit{Separate Spatial-Temporal Attention (SSTA)}-are leveraged to suppress the influence of irrelevant pixels and video frames. The JSTA module performs a coarse-grained filtering by computing a unified weight map across the spatio-temporal dimensions, while the SSTA module conducts a more fine-grained refinement by separately modeling temporal and spatial attentions. Extensive experiments conducted on the CMLR and GRID datasets demonstrate that MA-LipNet significantly reduces the Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER), validating its effectiveness and superiority over several state-of-the-art methods. Our work highlights the importance of multi-dimensional feature refinement for robust visual speech recognition."}

In this work we formalize and target the more challenging non-Markov setting, where a user may refer back to earlier states, undo changes, or reference entities introduced several rounds ago. We present (i) non-Markov multi-round data construction strategies, including rollback-style editing that forces retrieval of earlier visual states and name-based multi-round personalization that binds names to appearances across rounds; (ii) a history-conditioned training and inference framework with token-level caching to prevent multi-round identity drift; and (iii) enabling improvements for high-fidelity image reconstruction and editable personalization, including a reconstruction-based DiT detokenizer and a multi-stage fine-tuning curriculum. We demonstrate that explicitly training for non-Markov interactions yields substantial improvements in multi-round consistency and instruction compliance, while maintaining strong single-round editing and personalization."}

In recent years, several solutions have been proposed to correct LPP artifacts, either in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, which are expensive to collect. Moreover, existing approaches focus solely either on image-space or sinogram-space correction, ignoring the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. In this work, we propose an unrolled dual-domain method based on synthetic data to correct LPP artifacts. Specifically, the intrinsic correlations of LPP between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data generated from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring any real-world clinical data. In experiments simulating 1-2% detectors defect near the isocenter, the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results indicate that our solution can correct LPP artifacts without the cost of data collection for model training, and it is adaptable to different scanner settings for software-based applications."}

We propose ActionVLM, a vision-language aggregation framework that systematically mitigates modality bias in TAL. Our key insight is to preserve vision as the dominant signal while adaptively exploiting language only when beneficial. To this end, we introduce (i) a debiasing reweighting module that estimates the language advantage-the incremental benefit of language over vision-only predictions-and dynamically reweights language modality accordingly, and (ii) a residual aggregation strategy that treats language as a complementary refinement rather than the primary driver. This combination alleviates modality bias, reduces overconfidence from linguistic priors, and strengthens temporal reasoning.

Existing training-free open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) methods typically fuse CLIP and vision foundation models (VFMs) using \"one-way injection\" and \"shallow post-processing\" strategies, making it difficult to satisfy these requirements. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-regularization-aware dual-branch collaborative inference framework for training-free OVSS, termed SDCI. First, during feature encoding, SDCI introduces a cross-model attention fusion (CAF) module, which guides collaborative inference by injecting self-attention maps into each other. Second, we propose a bidirectional cross-graph diffusion refinement (BCDR) module that enhances the reliability of dual-branch segmentation scores through iterative random-walk diffusion. Finally, we incorporate low-level superpixel structures and develop a convex-optimization-based superpixel collaborative prediction (CSCP) mechanism to further refine object boundaries. Experiments on multiple remote sensing semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better performance than existing approaches.

Dense retrieval with dual-modality encoders leads in accuracy, but its computation and storage scale poorly with corpus size. Thus, real-time large-scale applications adopt two-stage retrieval, where a fast recall model gathers a small candidate pool, which is reranked by an advanced dense retriever. Due to hugely reduced candidates, the reranking model can use any off-the-shelf dense retriever without hurting efficiency, meaning the recall model bounds two-stage TVR performance. Recently, generative retrieval (GR) replaces dense video embeddings with discrete semantic IDs and retrieves by decoding text queries into ID tokens. GR offers near-constant inference and storage complexity, and its semantic IDs capture high-level video features via quantization, making it ideal for quickly eliminating irrelevant candidates during recall. However, as a recall model in two-stage TVR, GR suffers from (i) semantic ambiguity, where each video satisfies diverse queries but is forced into one semantic ID; and (ii) cross-modal misalignment, as semantic IDs are solely derived from visual features without text supervision. We propose Generative Recall and Dense Reranking (GRDR), designing a novel GR method to uplift recalled candidate quality. GRDR assigns multiple semantic IDs to each video using a query-guided multi-view tokenizer exposing diverse semantic access paths, and jointly trains the tokenizer and generative retriever via a shared codebook to cast semantic IDs as the semantic bridge between texts and videos. At inference, trie-constrained decoding generates a compact candidate set reranked by a dense model for fine-grained matching. Experiments on TVR benchmarks show GRDR matches strong dense retrievers in accuracy while reducing index storage by an order of magnitude and accelerating up to 300$\\times$ in full-corpus retrieval."}

In this paper, we introduce the first benchmark for geolocation reasoning chains. We focus on the global location prediction task in the popular GeoGuessr game which draws from Google Street View spanning more than 100 countries. We collaborate with expert GeoGuessr players, including the reigning world champion, to produce 800 ground truth reasoning chains for 500 query scenes. These expert reasoning chains address hundreds of different discriminative visual attributes such as license plate shape, architecture, and soil properties to name just a few. We evaluate LLM-as-a-judge and VLM-as-a-judge strategies for scoring VLM-generated reasoning chains against our expert reasoning chains and find that Qwen 3 LLM-as-a-judge correlates best with human scoring. Our benchmark reveals that while large, closed-source VLMs such as Gemini and GPT 5 rival human experts at prediction locations, they still lag behind human experts when it comes to producing auditable reasoning chains.

We introduce WorldBench, a novel video-based benchmark specifically designed for concept-specific, disentangled evaluation, allowing us to rigorously isolate and assess understanding of a single physical concept or law at a time. To make WorldBench comprehensive, we design benchmarks at two different levels: 1) an evaluation of intuitive physical understanding with concepts such as object permanence or scale/perspective, and 2) an evaluation of low-level physical constants and material properties such as friction coefficients or fluid viscosity. When SOTA video-based world models are evaluated on WorldBench, we find specific patterns of failure in particular physics concepts, with all tested models lacking the physical consistency required to generate reliable real-world interactions. Through its concept-specific evaluation, WorldBench offers a more nuanced and scalable framework for rigorously evaluating the physical reasoning capabilities of video generation and world models, paving the way for more robust and generalizable world-model-driven learning."}

Although deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA), effectively handling the sparse and irregular nature of input depth data in deep networks remains a significant challenge, often limiting performance, especially under high sparsity. To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Gaussian Belief Propagation Network (GBPN), a novel hybrid framework synergistically integrating deep learning with probabilistic graphical models for end-to-end depth completion. Specifically, a scene-specific Markov Random Field (MRF) is dynamically constructed by the Graphical Model Construction Network (GMCN), and then inferred via Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to yield the dense depth distribution. Crucially, the GMCN learns to construct not only the data-dependent potentials of MRF but also its structure by predicting adaptive non-local edges, enabling the capture of complex, long-range spatial dependencies. Furthermore, we enhance GBP with a serial \\& parallel message passing scheme, designed for effective information propagation, particularly from sparse measurements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GBPN achieves SOTA performance on the NYUv2 and KITTI benchmarks.

Meeting this demand depends not only on increasing agricultural yield but also on minimizing food loss caused by crop diseases. Diseases account for a substantial portion of apple production losses, despite apples being among the most widely produced and nutritionally valuable fruits worldwide. Previous studies have employed machine learning techniques for feature extraction and early diagnosis of apple leaf diseases, and more recently, deep learning-based models have shown remarkable performance in disease recognition. However, most state-of-the-art deep learning models are highly parameter-intensive, resulting in increased training and inference time. Although lightweight models are more suitable for user-friendly and resource-constrained applications, they often suffer from performance degradation. To address the trade-off between efficiency and performance, we propose Mam-App, a parameter-efficient Mamba-based model for feature extraction and leaf disease classification.

To further accelerate inference, we propose the Adaptive Computation Graph Reconfiguration (AdaGraph) strategy, which effectively overcomes the efficiency bottleneck of traditional serial inference through spatiotemporal decoupling in the generation process.

Motivated by this observation, we propose a principled framework to mitigate OOD overconfidence by leveraging the geometry of OT-induced singular boundaries. Specifically, we formulate an OT problem between a continuous base distribution and the latent embeddings of training data, and identify the resulting singular boundaries. By sampling near these boundaries, we construct a class of OOD inputs, termed optimal transport-induced OOD samples (OTIS), which are geometrically grounded and inherently semantically ambiguous. During training, a confidence suppression loss is applied to OTIS to guide the model toward more calibrated predictions in structurally uncertain regions. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly alleviates OOD overconfidence and outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}

A Pseudotime Analysis of Visual Representations", "comment": "21 pages, 17 figures. Appendix included", "summary": "Vision foundation models trained on discretely sampled images achieve strong performance on classification benchmarks, yet whether their representations encode the continuous processes underlying their training data remains unclear. This question is especially pertinent in computational pathology, where we posit that models whose latent representations implicitly capture continuous disease progression may better reflect underlying biology, support more robust generalization, and enable quantitative analyses of features associated with disease transitions. Using diffusion pseudotime, a method developed to infer developmental trajectories from single-cell transcriptomics, we probe whether foundation models organize disease states along coherent progression directions in representation space. Across four cancer progressions and six models, we find that all pathology-specific models recover trajectory orderings significantly exceeding null baselines, with vision-only models achieving the highest fidelities $(τ> 0.78$ on CRC-Serrated). Model rankings by trajectory fidelity on reference diseases strongly predict few-shot classification performance on held-out diseases ($ρ= 0.92$), and exploratory analysis shows cell-type composition varies smoothly along inferred trajectories in patterns consistent with known stromal remodeling. Together, these results demonstrate that vision foundation models can implicitly learn to represent continuous processes from independent static observations, and that trajectory fidelity provides a complementary measure of representation quality beyond downstream performance. While demonstrated in pathology, this framework could be applied to other domains where continuous processes are observed through static snapshots."}

To address these challenges, we propose Dynamical Adapter Fusion (DAF) to construct a single robust global adapter. Grounded in the PAC-Bayes theorem, we derive a fusion mechanism that explicitly integrates three components: the optimized task-specific adapter parameters, the previous global adapter parameters, and the initialization parameters. We utilize the Taylor expansion of the loss function to derive the optimal fusion coefficients, dynamically achieving the best balance between stability and plasticity. Furthermore, we propose a Robust Initialization strategy to effectively capture global knowledge patterns.

To this end, we propose Semantic-Guided Dynamic Sparsification (SGDS), a novel method that proactively guides the activation space by governing the orientation and rank of its subspaces through targeted sparsification. Specifically, SGDS promotes knowledge transfer by encouraging similar classes to share a compact activation subspace, while simultaneously preventing interference by assigning non-overlapping activation subspaces to dissimilar classes. By sculpting class-specific sparse subspaces in the activation space, SGDS effectively mitigates interference without imposing rigid constraints on the parameter space. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SGDS."}

Our framework is distinguished by two core contributions. First, the Geometry-Aware Lifting Module, featuring a novel dual-scan Mamba architecture, creates a robust foundation for reconstruction. It directly grounds the 2D-to-3D pose lifting process with geometric cues from image features, producing a highly reliable 3D pose sequence that serves as a stable anchor.

Existing methods primarily rely on geometry-aware feature learning or appearance-conditioned prompting, while implicitly assuming that the geometry-invariant dot-product similarity used in attention mechanisms remains reliable under large viewpoint and scale variations. We argue that this assumption does not hold. Extreme camera geometry systematically distorts the query-key similarity space and degrades attention-based matching, even when feature representations are partially aligned.\n  To address this issue, we introduce Geometry-Induced Query-Key Transformation (GIQT), a lightweight low-rank module that explicitly rectifies the similarity space by conditioning query-key interactions on camera geometry. Rather than modifying feature representations or the attention formulation itself, GIQT adapts the similarity computation to compensate for dominant geometry-induced anisotropic distortions. Building on this local similarity rectification, we further incorporate a geometry-conditioned prompt generation mechanism that provides global, view-adaptive representation priors derived directly from camera geometry.\n  Experiments on four aerial-ground person re-identification benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under extreme and previously unseen geometric conditions, while introducing minimal computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods."}

In this work, we propose UniMRG (Unified Multi-Representation Generation), a simple yet effective architecture-agnostic post-training method. UniMRG enhances the understanding capabilities of UMMs by incorporating auxiliary generation tasks. Specifically, we train UMMs to generate multiple intrinsic representations of input images, namely pixel (reconstruction), depth (geometry), and segmentation (structure), alongside standard visual understanding objectives. By synthesizing these diverse representations, UMMs capture complementary information regarding appearance, spatial relations, and structural layout. Consequently, UMMs develop a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of visual inputs. Extensive experiments across diverse UMM architectures demonstrate that our method notably enhances fine-grained perception, reduces hallucinations, and improves spatial understanding, while simultaneously boosting generation capabilities."}

We argue that AI-generated videos are essentially products of a manifold-fitting process rather than a physical recording. Consequently, the pixel composition logic of consecutive adjacent frames residual in AI videos exhibits a structured and homogenous characteristic. We term this phenomenon `Manifold Projection Fluctuations' (MPF). Driven by this insight, we propose a hierarchical dual-path framework that operates as a sequential filtering process. The first, the Static Manifold Deviation Branch, leverages the refined perceptual boundaries of Large-Scale Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to capture residual spatial anomalies or physical violations that deviate from the natural real-world manifold (off-manifold). For the remaining high-fidelity videos that successfully reside on-manifold and evade spatial detection, we introduce the Micro-Temporal Fluctuation Branch as a secondary, fine-grained filter. By analyzing the structured MPF that persists even in visually perfect sequences, our framework ensures that forgeries are exposed regardless of whether they manifest as global real-world manifold deviations or subtle computational fingerprints."}

However, their reliability for quantitative 3D analysis in dense, self-occluding scenes remains poorly understood. In this study, we identify a fundamental failure mode of implicit density fields under heavy occlusion, which we term Interior Geometric Degradation (IGD). We show that transmittance-based volumetric optimization satisfies photometric supervision by reconstructing hollow or fragmented structures rather than solid interiors, leading to systematic instance undercounting. Through controlled experiments on synthetic datasets with increasing occlusion, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mask-supervised NeRFs saturate at approximately 89% instance recovery in dense scenes, despite improved surface coherence and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce an explicit geometric pipeline based on Sparse Voxel Rasterization (SVRaster), initialized from SfM feature geometry. By projecting 2D instance masks onto an explicit voxel grid and enforcing geometric separation via recursive splitting, our approach preserves physical solidity and achieves a 95.8% recovery rate in dense clusters. A sensitivity analysis using degraded segmentation masks further shows that explicit SfM-based geometry is substantially more robust to supervision failure, recovering 43% more instances than implicit baselines. These results demonstrate that explicit geometric priors are a prerequisite for reliable quantitative analysis in highly self-occluding 3D scenes."}

In particular, our framework integrates token-based generation and diffusion-based editing within a single scene graph-driven model, ensuring high-quality and consistent results. Through extensive experiments, we empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods."}

The ability to generate crash-like imagery challenges the boundary between authentic and synthetic data, introducing new risks of misuse in fraud or claim manipulation. To address these issues, we propose HERS (Hidden-Pattern Expert Learning for Risk-Specific Damage Adaptation), a framework designed to improve fidelity, controllability, and domain alignment of diffusion-generated damage images. HERS fine-tunes a base diffusion model via domain-specific expert adaptation without requiring manual annotation. Using self-supervised image-text pairs automatically generated by a large language model and T2I pipeline, HERS models each damage category, such as dents, scratches, broken lights, or cracked paint, as a separate expert. These experts are later integrated into a unified multi-damage model that balances specialization with generalization. We evaluate HERS across four diffusion backbones and observe consistent improvements: plus 5.5 percent in text faithfulness and plus 2.3 percent in human preference ratings compared to baselines. Beyond image fidelity, we discuss implications for fraud detection, auditability, and safe deployment of generative models in high-stakes domains. Our findings highlight both the opportunities and risks of domain-specific diffusion, underscoring the importance of trustworthy generation in safety-critical applications such as auto insurance."}

Recent attention-free architectures demonstrate that strong performance can be achieved without pairwise attention, motivating the search for alternatives. In this work, we introduce Vision KAN (ViK), an attention-free backbone inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. At its core lies MultiPatch-RBFKAN, a unified token mixer that combines (a) patch-wise nonlinear transform with Radial Basis Function-based KANs, (b) axis-wise separable mixing for efficient local propagation, and (c) low-rank global mapping for long-range interaction. Employing as a drop-in replacement for attention modules, this formulation tackles the prohibitive cost of full KANs on high-resolution features by adopting a patch-wise grouping strategy with lightweight operators to restore cross-patch dependencies. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that ViK achieves competitive accuracy with linear complexity, demonstrating the potential of KAN-based token mixing as an efficient and theoretically grounded alternative to attention."}

Existing solutions face a dichotomy: training-free solvers suffer from significant performance degradation at low Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs), while training-based one- or few-steps generation methods incur prohibitive training costs and lack plug-and-play versatility. To bridge this gap, we propose the Bi-Anchor Interpolation Solver (BA-solver). BA-solver retains the versatility of standard training-free solvers while achieving significant acceleration by introducing a lightweight SideNet (1-2% backbone size) alongside the frozen backbone. Specifically, our method is founded on two synergistic components: \\textbf{1) Bidirectional Temporal Perception}, where the SideNet learns to approximate both future and historical velocities without retraining the heavy backbone; and 2) Bi-Anchor Velocity Integration, which utilizes the SideNet with two anchor velocities to efficiently approximate intermediate velocities for batched high-order integration. By utilizing the backbone to establish high-precision ``anchors'' and the SideNet to densify the trajectory, BA-solver enables large interval sizes with minimized error. Empirical results on ImageNet-256^2 demonstrate that BA-solver achieves generation quality comparable to 100+ NFEs Euler solver in just 10 NFEs and maintains high fidelity in as few as 5 NFEs, incurring negligible training costs. Furthermore, BA-solver ensures seamless integration with existing generative pipelines, facilitating downstream tasks such as image editing."}

Furthermore, we devise a dual modulation strategy: the noise schedule aligns diverse degradations into a shared high-entropy latent space, while the path schedule adaptively regulates the transport trajectory motivated by the viscous dynamics of entropy regularization. By effectively rectifying the transport geometry and dynamics, UDBM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse restoration tasks within a single inference step."}

HydroSense employs a novel dual-microcontroller architecture, utilizing Arduino Uno for precision analog measurements with five-point calibration algorithms and ESP32 for wireless connectivity, edge processing, and cloud integration. The system implements advanced signal processing techniques including median filtering for TDS measurement, temperature compensation algorithms, and robust error handling. Experimental validation over 90 days demonstrates exceptional performance metrics: pH accuracy of plus or minus 0.08 units across the 0 to 14 range, DO measurement stability within plus or minus 0.2 mg/L, TDS accuracy of plus or minus 1.9 percent across 0 to 1000 ppm, and 99.8 percent cloud data transmission reliability.

To address these gaps, we propose WMVLM, the first unified and interpretable evaluation framework for diffusion model image watermarking via vision-language models (VLMs). We redefine quality and security metrics for each watermark type: residual watermarks are evaluated by artifact strength and erasure resistance, while semantic watermarks are assessed through latent distribution shifts.

While this literature shows that there is an area where model representations are similar, we study here how vision models might get to those representations -- in particular, do they also converge to the same intermediate steps and operations? We therefore study the processes that lead to convergent representations in different models. First, we quantify distance between different model representations at different stages. We follow the evolution of distances between models throughout processing, identifying the processing steps which are most different between models. We find that while layers at similar positions in different models have the most similar representations, strong differences remain. Classifier models, unlike the others, will discard information about low-level image statistics in their final layers. CNN- and transformer-based models also behave differently, with transformer models applying smoother changes to representations from one layer to the next. These distinctions clarify the level and nature of convergence between model representations, and enables a more qualitative account of the underlying processes in image models."}

In recent ImageNet-scale AE studies, we observe a systematic bias toward generative metrics in handling this trade-off: reconstruction metrics are increasingly under-reported, and ablation-based AE selection often favors the best-gFID configuration even when reconstruction fidelity degrades. We theoretically analyze why this gFID-dominant preference can appear unproblematic for ImageNet generation, yet becomes risky when scaling to controllable diffusion: AEs can induce condition drift, which limits achievable condition alignment. Meanwhile, we find that reconstruction fidelity, especially instance-level measures, better indicates controllability. We empirically validate the impact of tilted autoencoder evaluation on controllability by studying several recent ImageNet AEs. Using a multi-dimensional condition-drift evaluation protocol reflecting controllable generation tasks, we find that gFID is only weakly predictive of condition preservation, whereas reconstruction-oriented metrics are substantially more aligned. ControlNet experiments further confirm that controllability tracks condition preservation rather than gFID. Overall, our results expose a gap between ImageNet-centric AE evaluation and the requirements of scalable controllable diffusion, offering practical guidance for more reliable benchmarking and model selection."}

Moreover, we propose a two-stage SFT-RL multi-domain training method for OCRVerse. SFT directly mixes cross-domain data to train and establish initial domain knowledge, while RL focuses on designing personalized reward strategies for the characteristics of each domain. Specifically, since different domains require various output formats and expected outputs, we provide sufficient flexibility in the RL stage to customize flexible reward signals for each domain, thereby improving cross-domain fusion and avoiding data conflicts.

For example, two IQA models may achieve identical SRCC values, yet one ranks high-quality images (related to high Mean Opinion Score, MOS) more reliably, while the other better discriminates image pairs with small quality/MOS differences (related to $|Δ$MOS$|$). Such complementary behaviors are invisible under global metrics. Moreover, SRCC and PLCC are sensitive to test-sample quality distributions, yielding unstable comparisons across test sets.

In this work, we present an efficient pipeline for single-view 3D reconstruction of real ships by training entirely on synthetic data and requiring only a single view at inference. Our approach uses the Splatter Image network, which represents objects as sparse sets of 3D Gaussians for rapid and accurate reconstruction from single images. The model is first fine-tuned on synthetic ShapeNet vessels and further refined with a diverse custom dataset of 3D ships, bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world imagery. We integrate a state-of-the-art segmentation module based on YOLOv8 and custom preprocessing to ensure compatibility with the reconstruction network. Postprocessing steps include real-world scaling, centering, and orientation alignment, followed by georeferenced placement on an interactive web map using AIS metadata and homography-based mapping. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic validation data demonstrates strong reconstruction fidelity, while qualitative results on real maritime images from the ShipSG dataset confirm the potential for transfer to operational maritime settings. The final system provides interactive 3D inspection of real ships without requiring real-world 3D annotations. This pipeline provides an efficient, scalable solution for maritime monitoring and highlights a path toward real-time 3D ship visualization in practical applications.

Leveraging the Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, CG-MLLM decouples disparate modeling needs, where the Token-level Autoregressive (TokenAR) Transformer handles token-level content, and the Block-level Autoregressive (BlockAR) Transformer handles block-level content. By integrating a pre-trained vision-language backbone with a specialized 3D VAE latent space, CG-MLLM facilitates long-context interactions between standard tokens and spatial blocks within a single integrated architecture.

However, open-source VLMs still lag behind proprietary systems, largely due to the lack of high-quality reasoning data. Existing datasets offer limited coverage of challenging domains such as STEM diagrams and visual puzzles, and lack consistent, long-form Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations essential for eliciting strong reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMFineReason, a large-scale multimodal reasoning dataset comprising 1.8M samples and 5.1B solution tokens, featuring high-quality reasoning annotations distilled from Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Thinking. The dataset is established via a systematic three-stage pipeline: (1) large-scale data collection and standardization, (2) CoT rationale generation, and (3) comprehensive selection based on reasoning quality and difficulty awareness. The resulting dataset spans STEM problems, visual puzzles, games, and complex diagrams, with each sample annotated with visually grounded reasoning traces. We fine-tune Qwen3-VL-Instruct on MMFineReason to develop MMFineReason-2B/4B/8B versions. Our models establish new state-of-the-art results for their size class. Notably, MMFineReason-4B succesfully surpasses Qwen3-VL-8B-Thinking, and MMFineReason-8B even outperforms Qwen3-VL-30B-A3B-Thinking while approaching Qwen3-VL-32B-Thinking, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency. Crucially, we uncover a \"less is more\" phenomenon via our difficulty-aware filtering strategy: a subset of just 7\\% (123K samples) achieves performance comparable to the full dataset.

Instead of suppressing diffusion updates or applying masking heuristics, our approach reinterprets diffusion as the evolution of stochastic trajectories through a structured latent space. By shaping the initial noise and its geometric alignment, background generation naturally avoids designated foreground regions, allowing readable content to remain intact without auxiliary mechanisms. To address the long-standing issue of stylistic drift across pages, we decouple style control from text conditioning and introduce cached style directions as persistent vectors in latent space. Once selected, these directions constrain diffusion trajectories to a shared stylistic subspace, ensuring consistent appearance across pages and editing iterations. This formulation eliminates the need for repeated prompt-based style specification and provides a more stable foundation for multi-page generation. Our framework admits a geometric and physical interpretation, where diffusion paths evolve on a latent manifold shaped by preferred directions, and foreground regions are rarely traversed as a consequence of trajectory initialization rather than explicit exclusion. The proposed method is training-free, compatible with existing diffusion backbones, and produces visually coherent, foreground-preserving results across complex documents. By reframing diffusion as trajectory design in latent space, we offer a principled approach to consistent and structured generative modeling."}

Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale. We validate their effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements on large-scale models such as DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5."}

However, existing approaches generally rely on heuristic KV Cache policies, which ignore differences in token importance in long-term video generation. This leads to the loss of critical spatiotemporal information and the accumulation of redundant, invalid cache, thereby degrading video generation quality and efficiency. To address this limitation, we first observe that token contributions to video generation are highly time-heterogeneous and accordingly propose a novel Past- and Future-Informed KV Cache Policy (PaFu-KV). Specifically, PaFu-KV introduces a lightweight Salience Estimation Head distilled from a bidirectional teacher to estimate salience scores, allowing the KV cache to retain informative tokens while discarding less relevant ones. This policy yields a better quality-efficiency trade-off by shrinking KV cache capacity and reducing memory footprint at inference time. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method preserves high-fidelity video generation quality while enables accelerated inference, thereby enabling more efficient long-horizon video generation.

Current defenses predominantly rely on the \"locality hypothesis\", suppressing isolated neurons or features. However, harmful semantics act as distributed, cross-layer circuits, rendering such localized interventions brittle and detrimental to utility. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textbf{TraceRouter}, a path-level framework that traces and disconnects the causal propagation circuits of illicit semantics. TraceRouter operates in three stages: (1) it pinpoints a sensitive onset layer by analyzing attention divergence; (2) it leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and differential activation analysis to disentangle and isolate malicious features; and (3) it maps these features to downstream causal pathways via feature influence scores (FIS) derived from zero-out interventions. By selectively suppressing these causal chains, TraceRouter physically severs the flow of harmful information while leaving orthogonal computation routes intact. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TraceRouter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a superior trade-off between adversarial robustness and general utility.

To address this limitation, we draw inspiration from the pyramidal process of human motion perception (from joint dynamics to segment coherence, and finally to holistic comprehension) and propose a novel Pyramidal Shapley-Taylor (PST) learning framework for fine-grained motion-language retrieval. Specifically, the framework decomposes human motion into temporal segments and spatial body joints, and learns cross-modal correspondences through progressive joint-wise and segment-wise alignment in a pyramidal fashion, effectively capturing both local semantic details and hierarchical structural relationships. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving precise alignment between motion segments and body joints and their corresponding text tokens.

VideoAesBench has several significant characteristics: (1) Diverse content including 1,804 videos from multiple video sources including user-generated (UGC), AI-generated (AIGC), compressed, robotic-generated (RGC), and game videos.

We propose FeatJND, a task-aligned JND formulation that predicts the maximum tolerable per-feature perturbation map while preserving downstream task performance. We propose a FeatJND estimator at standardized split points and validate it across image classification, detection, and instance segmentation. Under matched distortion strength, FeatJND-based distortions consistently preserve higher task performance than unstructured Gaussian perturbations, and attribution visualizations suggest FeatJND can suppress non-critical feature regions.

To address this mismatch, we propose Shallow Alignment, a novel contrastive learning strategy that aligns neural signals with intermediate representations of visual encoders rather than their final outputs, thereby striking a better balance between low-level texture details and high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Shallow Alignment significantly outperforms standard final-layer alignment, with performance gains ranging from 22% to 58% across diverse vision backbones.

Building on our prior work on Action Anticipation at a Glimpse (AAG), we conduct a systematic investigation of single-frame action anticipation enriched with complementary sources of information. We analyze the contribution of RGB appearance, depth-based geometric cues, and semantic representations of past actions, and investigate how different multimodal fusion strategies, keyframe selection policies and past-action history sources influence anticipation performance. Guided by these findings, we consolidate the most effective design choices into AAG+, a refined single-frame anticipation framework.

To address this challenge, we present the first urban NSR framework that fuses 3D synthetic aperture radar (SAR) point clouds with aerial imagery for high-fidelity reconstruction under constrained, sparse-view settings. 3D SAR can efficiently capture large-scale geometry even from a single side-looking flight path, providing robust priors that complement photometric cues from images. Our framework integrates radar-derived spatial constraints into an SDF-based NSR backbone, guiding structure-aware ray selection and adaptive sampling for stable and efficient optimization. We also construct the first benchmark dataset with co-registered 3D SAR point clouds and aerial imagery, facilitating systematic evaluation of cross-modal 3D reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that incorporating 3D SAR markedly enhances reconstruction accuracy, completeness, and robustness compared with single-modality baselines under highly sparse and oblique-view conditions, highlighting a viable route toward scalable high-fidelity urban reconstruction with advanced airborne and spaceborne optical-SAR sensing."}

We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations. Our method outperforms implementations of prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D, achieving lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel application to robotic video trajectories: by recombining learned action components, we generate diverse sequences that significantly increase state-space coverage for exploration on the LIBERO benchmark."}

However, constrained by the capacity of their internal world knowledge, prior work has proposed augmenting MLLMs by ``reasoning-then-tool-call'' for visual and textual search engines to obtain substantial gains on tasks requiring extensive factual information. However, these approaches typically define multimodal search in a naive setting, assuming that a single full-level or entity-level image query and few text query suffices to retrieve the key evidence needed to answer the question, which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios with substantial visual noise. Moreover, they are often limited in the reasoning depth and search breadth, making it difficult to solve complex questions that require aggregating evidence from diverse visual and textual sources. Building on this, we propose Vision-DeepResearch, which proposes one new multimodal deep-research paradigm, i.e., performs multi-turn, multi-entity and multi-scale visual and textual search to robustly hit real-world search engines under heavy noise. Our Vision-DeepResearch supports dozens of reasoning steps and hundreds of engine interactions, while internalizing deep-research capabilities into the MLLM via cold-start supervision and RL training, resulting in a strong end-to-end multimodal deep-research MLLM. It substantially outperforming existing multimodal deep-research MLLMs, and workflows built on strong closed-source foundation model such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-4-Sonnet.

While integrating object detectors as prompt generators offers a pathway to automation, existing pipelines suffer from two fundamental limitations: objective mismatch, where detectors optimized for geometric localization do not correspond to the optimal prompting context required by SAM, and alignment overfitting in standard joint training, where the detector simply memorizes specific prompt adjustments for training samples rather than learning a generalizable policy. To bridge this gap, we introduce BLO-Inst, a unified framework that aligns detection and segmentation objectives by bi-level optimization. We formulate the alignment as a nested optimization problem over disjoint data splits. In the lower level, the SAM is fine-tuned to maximize segmentation fidelity given the current detection proposals on a subset ($D_1$). In the upper level, the detector is updated to generate bounding boxes that explicitly minimize the validation loss of the fine-tuned SAM on a separate subset ($D_2$). This effectively transforms the detector into a segmentation-aware prompt generator, optimizing the bounding boxes not just for localization accuracy, but for downstream mask quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BLO-Inst achieves superior performance, outperforming standard baselines on tasks in general and biomedical domains."}

Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation."}

In this work, we propose a novel framework for creative generation using diffusion models, where creativity is associated with the inverse probability of an image's existence in the CLIP embedding space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a manual blending of concepts or exclusion of subcategories, our method calculates the probability distribution of generated images and drives it towards low-probability regions to produce rare, imaginative, and visually captivating outputs. We also introduce pullback mechanisms, achieving high creativity without sacrificing visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our creative generation framework, showcasing its ability to produce unique, novel, and thought-provoking images. This work provides a new perspective on creativity in generative models, offering a principled method to foster innovation in visual content synthesis."}

Retrospective reviews of prediagnostic CT scans, when conducted by expert radiologists aware that the patient later developed PDAC, frequently reveal lesions that were previously overlooked. To help detecting these lesions earlier, we developed an automated system named ePAI (early Pancreatic cancer detection with Artificial Intelligence). It was trained on data from 1,598 patients from a single medical center. In the internal test involving 1,009 patients, ePAI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.939-0.999, a sensitivity of 95.3%, and a specificity of 98.7% for detecting small PDAC less than 2 cm in diameter, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 2 mm. In an external test involving 7,158 patients across 6 centers, ePAI achieved an AUC of 0.918-0.945, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 88.0%, precisely localizing PDAC as small as 5 mm. Importantly, ePAI detected PDACs on prediagnostic CT scans obtained 3 to 36 months before clinical diagnosis that had originally been overlooked by radiologists. It successfully detected and localized PDACs in 75 of 159 patients, with a median lead time of 347 days before clinical diagnosis. Our multi-reader study showed that ePAI significantly outperformed 30 board-certified radiologists by 50.3% (P < 0.05) in sensitivity while maintaining a comparable specificity of 95.4% in detecting PDACs early and prediagnostic. These findings suggest its potential of ePAI as an assistive tool to improve early detection of pancreatic cancer."}

Existing attempts to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap for full-scene relighting remain suboptimal. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($π$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that $π$-Light synthesizes specular highlights and diffuse reflections across a wide variety of materials, achieving superior generalization to real-world scenes compared with prior approaches."}

Probing Visual Perception vs. Memory with Classic Visual Illusions", "comment": "26 pages, 31 figures, 13 tables. Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/vi-probe/", "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions \"correctly\" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

UEval comprises 1,000 expert-curated questions that require both images and text in the model output, sourced from 8 real-world tasks. Our curated questions cover a wide range of reasoning types, from step-by-step guides to textbook explanations. Evaluating open-ended multimodal generation is non-trivial, as simple LLM-as-a-judge methods can miss the subtleties. Different from previous works that rely on multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to rate image quality or text accuracy, we design a rubric-based scoring system in UEval. For each question, reference images and text answers are provided to a MLLM to generate an initial rubric, consisting of multiple evaluation criteria, and human experts then refine and validate these rubrics. In total, UEval contains 10,417 validated rubric criteria, enabling scalable and fine-grained automatic scoring. UEval is challenging for current unified models: GPT-5-Thinking scores only 66.4 out of 100, while the best open-source model reaches merely 49.1. We observe that reasoning models often outperform non-reasoning ones, and transferring reasoning traces from a reasoning model to a non-reasoning model significantly narrows the gap. This suggests that reasoning may be important for tasks requiring complex multimodal understanding and generation."}

Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose \"pixel MeanFlow\" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models."}

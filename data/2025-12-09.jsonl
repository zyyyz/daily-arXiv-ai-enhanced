Unlike traditional dataset pruning and distillation methods that focus on inter-sample redundancy, the proposed method compresses each image by reducing redundant or less informative content within samples while preserving essential features. It first applies linear symmetric quantization to obtain an initial quantization range and scale for each sample. Then, an adaptive quantization allocation algorithm is introduced to distribute different quantization ratios for samples with varying precision requirements, maintaining a constant total compression ratio. The main contributions include: (1) being the first to use limited bits to represent datasets for storage reduction; (2) introducing a dataset-level quantization algorithm with adaptive ratio allocation; and (3) validating the method's effectiveness through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-1K. Results show that the method maintains model training performance while achieving significant dataset compression, outperforming traditional quantization and dataset pruning baselines under the same compression ratios."}

Existing methods often struggle with multi-view fusion, leading to fragmented 3D representations and sub-optimal performance. To address this, we introduce VG3T, a novel multi-view feed-forward network that predicts a 3D semantic occupancy via a 3D Gaussian representation. Unlike prior methods that infer Gaussians from single-view images, our model directly predicts a set of semantically attributed Gaussians in a joint, multi-view fashion. This novel approach overcomes the fragmentation and inconsistency inherent in view-by-view processing, offering a unified paradigm to represent both geometry and semantics. We also introduce two key components, Grid-Based Sampling and Positional Refinement, to mitigate the distance-dependent density bias common in pixel-aligned Gaussian initialization methods. Our VG3T shows a notable 1.7%p improvement in mIoU while using 46% fewer primitives than the previous state-of-the-art on the nuScenes benchmark, highlighting its superior efficiency and performance."}

However, existing models are predominantly trained on surgical pathology data, which is enriched for non-nervous tissue and overrepresents neoplastic, inflammatory, metabolic, and other non-neurological diseases. Neuropathology represents a markedly different domain of histopathology, characterized by unique cell types (neurons, glia, etc.), distinct cytoarchitecture, and disease-specific pathological features including neurofibrillary tangles, amyloid plaques, Lewy bodies, and pattern-specific neurodegeneration. This domain mismatch may limit the ability of general-purpose foundation models to capture the morphological patterns critical for interpreting neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebellar ataxias. To address this gap, we developed NeuroFM, a foundation model trained specifically on whole-slide images of brain tissue spanning diverse neurodegenerative pathologies. NeuroFM demonstrates superior performance compared to general-purpose models across multiple neuropathology-specific downstream tasks, including mixed dementia disease classification, hippocampal region segmentation, and neurodegenerative ataxia identification encompassing cerebellar essential tremor and spinocerebellar ataxia subtypes. This work establishes that domain-specialized foundation models trained on brain tissue can better capture neuropathology-specific features than models trained on general surgical pathology datasets. By tailoring foundation models to the unique morphological landscape of neurodegenerative diseases, NeuroFM enables more accurate and reliable AI-based analysis for brain disease diagnosis and research, setting a precedent for domain-specific model development in specialized areas of digital pathology."}

We introduce FishDetector-R1, a unified MLLM-based framework for fish detection, segmentation, and counting under weak supervision. On the DeepFish dataset, our framework achieves substantial gains over baselines, improving AP by 20% and mIoU by 10%, while reducing MAE by 30% and GAME by 35%. These improvements stem from two key components: a novel detect-to-count prompt that enforces spatially consistent detections and counts, and Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Reward (RLVR) with a complementary scalable paradigm leveraging sparse point labels.

In addition, CapsNets' training and testing are slow and resource hungry. This paper investigates the possibility of Primary Capsules pruning in CapsNets on MNIST handwritten digits, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN datasets. We show that a pruned version of CapsNet performs up to 9.90 times faster than the conventional architecture by removing 95 percent of Capsules without a loss of accuracy. Also, our pruned architecture saves on more than 95.36 percent of floating-point operations in the dynamic routing stage of the architecture.

The literature on adversarially robust Deep Learning attempts to either enhance the robustness of neural networks (e.g, via adversarial training) or to certify their decisions up to a given robustness level (e.g, by using randomized smoothing, formal methods or Lipschitz bounds). These studies mostly focus on classification tasks and few efficient certification procedures currently exist for semantic segmentation. In this work, we introduce a new class of certifiably robust Semantic Segmentation networks with built-in Lipschitz constraints that are efficiently trainable and achieve competitive pixel accuracy on challenging datasets such as Cityscapes. Additionally, we provide a novel framework that generalizes robustness certificates for semantic segmentation tasks, where we showcase the flexibility and computational efficiency of using Lipschitz networks. Our approach unlocks real-time compatible certifiably robust semantic segmentation for the first time. Moreover, it allows the computation of worst-case performance under $\\ell_2$ attacks of radius $ε$ across a wide range of performance measures. Crucially, we benchmark the runtime of our certification process and find our approach to be around 600 times faster than randomized smoothing methods at inference with comparable certificates on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. Finally, we evaluate the tightness of our worstcase certificates against state-of-the-art adversarial attacks to further validate the performance of our method."}

We present an automated, machine learning framework that couples high-throughput imaging with shape extraction and clustering to profile metallic powder morphology at scale. We develop and evaluate three clustering pipelines: an autoencoder pipeline, a shape-descriptor pipeline, and a functional-data pipeline. Across a dataset of approximately 126,000 powder images (0.5-102 micrometer diameter), internal validity metrics identify the Fourier-descriptor + k-means pipeline as the most effective, achieving the lowest Davies-Bouldin index and highest Calinski-Harabasz score while maintaining sub-millisecond runtime per particle on a standard desktop workstation. Although the present work focuses on establishing the morphological-clustering framework, the resulting shape groups form a basis for future studies examining their relationship to flowability, packing density, and SLM part quality. Overall, this unsupervised learning framework enables rapid, automated assessment of powder morphology and supports tracking of shape evolution across reuse cycles, offering a path toward real-time feedstock monitoring in SLM workflows."}

Despite recent progress, existing approaches either fail to capture nuanced user preferences or lack effective mechanisms to encode personalized visual signals. In this work, we propose a multimodal framework that leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to extract rich user representations and inject them into diffusion-based image generation. We train the MLLM with a preference-oriented visual question answering task to capture fine-grained semantic cues. To isolate preference-relevant features, we introduce two complementary probing tasks: inter-user discrimination to distinguish between different users, and intra-user discrimination to separate liked from disliked content. To ensure compatibility with diffusion text encoders, we design a maximum mean discrepancy-based alignment loss that bridges the modality gap while preserving multimodal structure. The resulting embeddings are used to condition the generator, enabling faithful adherence to both prompts and user preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms strong baselines in both image quality and preference alignment, highlighting the effectiveness of representation extraction and alignment for personalized generation."}

In contrast, SAM3 introduces a unified vision-language architecture capable of open-vocabulary reasoning, semantic grounding, contrastive alignment, and exemplar-based concept understanding. We structure this analysis through five core components: (1) a Conceptual Break Between Prompt-Based and Concept-Based Segmentation, contrasting spatial prompt semantics of SAM2 with multimodal fusion and text-conditioned mask generation of SAM3; (2) Architectural Divergence, detailing pure vision-temporal design of SAM2 versus integration of vision-language encoders, geometry and exemplar encoders, fusion modules, DETR-style decoders, object queries, and ambiguity-handling via Mixture-of-Experts in SAM3; (3) Dataset and Annotation Differences, contrasting SA-V video masks with multimodal concept-annotated corpora of SAM3; (4) Training and Hyperparameter Distinctions, showing why SAM2 optimization knowledge does not apply to SAM3; and (5) Evaluation, Metrics, and Failure Modes, outlining the transition from geometric IoU metrics to semantic, open-vocabulary evaluation.

Project page: https://shoot-bounce-3d.github.io", "summary": "3D scene reconstruction from a single measurement is challenging, especially in the presence of occluded regions and specular materials, such as mirrors. We address these challenges by leveraging single-photon lidars. These lidars estimate depth from light that is emitted into the scene and reflected directly back to the sensor. However, they can also measure light that bounces multiple times in the scene before reaching the sensor. This multi-bounce light contains additional information that can be used to recover dense depth, occluded geometry, and material properties. Prior work with single-photon lidar, however, has only demonstrated these use cases when a laser sequentially illuminates one scene point at a time. We instead focus on the more practical - and challenging - scenario of illuminating multiple scene points simultaneously. The complexity of light transport due to the combined effects of multiplexed illumination, two-bounce light, shadows, and specular reflections is challenging to invert analytically. Instead, we propose a data-driven method to invert light transport in single-photon lidar. To enable this approach, we create the first large-scale simulated dataset of ~100k lidar transients for indoor scenes. We use this dataset to learn a prior on complex light transport, enabling measured two-bounce light to be decomposed into the constituent contributions from each laser spot. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate how this decomposed light can be used to infer 3D geometry in scenes with occlusions and mirrors from a single measurement.

However, model opacity and the lack of interpretability remain critical barriers to clinical adoption, as clinicians often struggle to trust the decision-making processes of black-box models. To address this gap, we present a Cross-modal Explainable Framework for Melanoma (CEFM) that leverages contrastive learning as the core mechanism for achieving interpretability. Specifically, CEFM maps clinical criteria for melanoma diagnosis-namely Asymmetry, Border, and Color (ABC)-into the Vision Transformer embedding space using dual projection heads, thereby aligning clinical semantics with visual features. The aligned representations are subsequently translated into structured textual explanations via natural language generation, creating a transparent link between raw image data and clinical interpretation. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate 92.79% accuracy and an AUC of 0.961, along with significant improvements across multiple interpretability metrics. Qualitative analyses further show that the spatial arrangement of the learned embeddings aligns with clinicians' application of the ABC rule, effectively bridging the gap between high-performance classification and clinical trust."}

We hypothesize that the view discrepancy arises from supervision limited to pixel- or latent-space video-diffusion losses, which lack explicitly temporally aware, feature-level tracking guidance. We present \\emph{Track4DGen}, a two-stage framework that couples a multi-view video diffusion model with a foundation point tracker and a hybrid 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D-GS) reconstructor. The central idea is to explicitly inject tracker-derived motion priors into intermediate feature representations for both multi-view video generation and 4D-GS. In Stage One, we enforce dense, feature-level point correspondences inside the diffusion generator, producing temporally consistent features that curb appearance drift and enhance cross-view coherence. In Stage Two, we reconstruct a dynamic 4D-GS using a hybrid motion encoding that concatenates co-located diffusion features (carrying Stage-One tracking priors) with Hex-plane features, and augment them with 4D Spherical Harmonics for higher-fidelity dynamics modeling. \\emph{Track4DGen} surpasses baselines on both multi-view video generation and 4D generation benchmarks, yielding temporally stable, text-editable 4D assets.

In the physics of shadow formation, the occluder blocks some light rays casting from the light source that would otherwise arrive at the surface, creating a shadow that follows the silhouette of the occluder. However, such explicit physical modeling has rarely been used in deep-learning-based shadow generation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that embeds explicit physical modeling - geometry and illumination - into deep-learning-based shadow generation. First, given a monocular RGB image, we obtain approximate 3D geometry in the form of dense point maps and predict a single dominant light direction. These signals allow us to recover fairly accurate shadow location and shape based on the physics of shadow formation. We then integrate this physics-based initial estimate into a diffusion framework that refines the shadow into a realistic, high-fidelity appearance while ensuring consistency with scene geometry and illumination. Trained on DESOBAV2, our model produces shadows that are both visually realistic and physically coherent, outperforming existing approaches, especially in scenes with complex geometry or ambiguous lighting."}

They are crucial for defining the three-dimensional structure of objects and enhancing scene understanding. Yet existing shadow detection methods mainly target cast shadows, and there are no dedicated datasets or models for detecting attached shadows. To address this gap, we introduce a framework that jointly detects cast and attached shadows by reasoning about their mutual relationship with scene illumination and geometry. Our system consists of a shadow detection module that predicts both shadow types separately, and a light estimation module that infers the light direction from the detected shadows. The estimated light direction, combined with surface normals, allows us to derive a geometry-consistent partial map that identifies regions likely to be self-occluded. This partial map is then fed back to refine shadow predictions, forming a closed-loop reasoning process that iteratively improves both shadow segmentation and light estimation. In order to train our method, we have constructed a dataset of 1,458 images with separate annotations for cast and attached shadows, enabling training and quantitative evaluation of both. Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative geometry-illumination reasoning substantially improves the detection of attached shadows, with at least 33% BER reduction, while maintaining strong full and cast shadow performance."}

Meanwhile, despite training on vast quantities of internet video data, state-of-the-art deep learning models still fall short of human-level performance on intuitive physics benchmarks. This work investigates whether data distribution, rather than volume, is the key to learning these principles. We pretrain a Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) model on SAYCam, a developmentally realistic, egocentric video dataset partially capturing three children's everyday visual experiences. We find that training on this dataset, which represents 0.01% of the data volume used to train SOTA models, does not lead to significant performance improvements on the IntPhys2 benchmark. Our results suggest that merely training on a developmentally realistic dataset is insufficient for current architectures to learn representations that support intuitive physics. We conclude that varying visual data volume and distribution alone may not be sufficient for building systems with artificial intuitive physics."}

NexusFlow introduces a set of surrogate networks with invertible coupling layers to align the latent feature distributions of tasks, creating a unified representation that enables effective knowledge transfer.

NexusFlow sets a new state-of-the-art result on nuScenes, outperforming strong partially supervised baselines. To demonstrate generality, we further test NexusFlow on NYUv2 using three homogeneous dense prediction tasks, segmentation, depth, and surface normals, as a representative N-task PS-MTL scenario.

To tackle this, we introduce LaFG, a Language-driven framework for Fine-Grained Retrieval that converts class names into attribute-level supervision using large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). Treating each name as a semantic anchor, LaFG prompts an LLM to generate detailed, attribute-oriented descriptions. To mitigate attribute omission in these descriptions, it leverages a frozen VLM to project them into a vision-aligned space, clustering them into a dataset-wide attribute vocabulary while harvesting complementary attributes from related categories. Leveraging this vocabulary, a global prompt template selects category-relevant attributes, which are aggregated into category-specific linguistic prototypes.

The core issue is not a lack of knowledge, but a path selection bias within the vast reasoning search space. Although LVLMs are often capable of sampling correct solution trajectories, they disproportionately favor unstable or logically inconsistent ones, leading to erratic and unreliable outcomes. The substantial disparity between Pass@K (with large K) and Pass@1 across numerous models provides compelling evidence that such failures primarily stem from misreasoning rather than ignorance. To systematically investigate and address this issue, we propose PSO (Path-Select Optimization), a two-stage post-training framework designed to enhance both the reasoning performance and stability of existing LVLMs. In the first stage, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with template and answer-based rewards to cultivate structured, step-by-step reasoning. In the second stage, we conduct online preference optimization, where the model samples reasoning paths from GRPO-generated data, self-evaluates them, and aligns itself toward the preferred trajectories. Incorrect or suboptimal paths are concurrently stored in a Negative Replay Memory (NRM) as hard negatives, which are periodically revisited to prevent the model from repeating prior mistakes and to facilitate continual reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments show that PSO effectively prunes invalid reasoning paths, substantially enhances reasoning accuracy (with 7.4% improvements on average), and yields more stable and consistent chains of thought.

To address this issue, our paper introduces a novel method that improves reconstruction by enforcing global geometry consistency through constrained multi-view triangulation.

The core challenge in stroke classification is modeling the semantic relationships between strokes. Our observations indicate that stroke interactions are typically localized, making it difficult for existing deep learning methods to capture such fine-grained relationships. Although viewing strokes from a point-level perspective can address this issue, it introduces redundancy. However, by selecting reference points and using their sequential order to represent strokes in a fine-grained manner, this problem can be effectively solved. This insight inspired StrokeNet, a novel network architecture encoding strokes as reference pair representations (points + feature vectors), where reference points enable spatial queries and features mediate interaction modeling. Specifically, we dynamically select reference points for each stroke and sequence them, employing an Inline Sequence Attention (ISA) module to construct contextual features. To capture spatial feature interactions, we devised a Cross-Ellipse Query (CEQ) mechanism that clusters reference points and extracts features across varying spatial scales. Finally, a joint optimization framework simultaneously predicts stroke categories via reference points regression and adjacent stroke semantic transition modeling through an Auxiliary Branch (Aux-Branch).

In this work, we aim to exploit the spatiotemporal properties of event streams based on point cloud-based framework, designed to enhance human pose estimation performance. We design Event Temporal Slicing Convolution module to capture short-term dependencies across event slices, and combine it with Event Slice Sequencing module for structured temporal modeling.

With just access to simple functional interfaces (e.g., point coordinates), our approach enables the emergence of complex CAD operations (e.g., pattern replication and mirror). This stands in contrast to previous methods, which typically rely on knowledge injected through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), offer limited support for editability, and fail to exploit the strong generative priors of PLMs. Specifically, the ReCAD framework begins by fine-tuning vision-language models (VLMs) to equip them with basic CAD model generation capabilities, where we rewrite CAD scripts into parameterized code that is leveraged to generate accurate textual descriptions for supervision. Then, we propose a novel RL strategy that incorporates parameterized code as guidance to enhance the model's reasoning on challenging questions. Furthermore, we employ a hierarchical primitive learning process to progressively teach structured and compositional skills under a unified reward function that ensures both geometric accuracy and semantic fidelity. ReCAD sets a new state-of-the-art in both text-to-CAD and image-to-CAD tasks, significantly improving geometric accuracy across in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. In the image-to-CAD task, for instance, it reduces the mean Chamfer Distance from 73.47 to 29.61 (in-distribution) and from 272.06 to 80.23 (out-of-distribution), outperforming existing baselines by a substantial margin."}

A key difficulty is that jointly processing PAN and MS often entangles spatial detail with spectral fidelity. We propose S2WMamba, which explicitly disentangles frequency information and then performs lightweight cross-modal interaction. Concretely, a 2D Haar DWT is applied to PAN to localize spatial edges and textures, while a channel-wise 1D Haar DWT treats each pixel's spectrum as a 1D signal to separate low/high-frequency components and limit spectral distortion. The resulting Spectral branch injects wavelet-extracted spatial details into MS features, and the Spatial branch refines PAN features using spectra from the 1D pyramid; the two branches exchange information through Mamba-based cross-modulation that models long-range dependencies with linear complexity. A multi-scale dynamic gate (multiplicative + additive) then adaptively fuses branch outputs.On WV3, GF2, and QB, S2WMamba matches or surpasses recent strong baselines (FusionMamba, CANNet, U2Net, ARConv), improving PSNR by up to 0.23 dB and reaching HQNR 0.956 on full-resolution WV3.

In this work, we reassess the positioning and role of of multimodal guidance, and propose a Multimodal-Guided Task-Aware Generative Image Compression (MTGC) framework. Specifically, MTGC integrates three guidance modalities to enhance semantic consistency: a concise but robust text caption for global semantics, a highly compressed image (HCI) retaining low-level visual information, and Semantic Pseudo-Words (SPWs) for fine-grained task-relevant semantics. The SPWs are generated by our designed Task-Aware Semantic Compression Module (TASCM), which operates in a task-oriented manner to drive the multi-head self-attention mechanism to focus on and extract semantics relevant to the generation task while filtering out redundancy. Subsequently, to facilitate the synergistic guidance of these modalities, we design a Multimodal-Guided Diffusion Decoder (MGDD) employing a dual-path cooperative guidance mechanism that synergizes cross-attention and ControlNet additive residuals to precisely inject these three guidance into the diffusion process, and leverages the diffusion model's powerful generative priors to reconstruct the image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTGC consistently improves semantic consistency (e.g., DISTS drops by 10.59% on the DIV2K dataset) while also achieving remarkable gains in perceptual quality and pixel-level fidelity at ultra-low bitrate."}

Mixed-Precision Quantization (MPQ), designed to push the limits of quantization, has demonstrated remarkable success in advancing U-Net quantization to sub-4bit settings while significantly reducing computational and memory overhead. Nevertheless, its application to DiT architectures remains limited and underexplored. In this work, we propose TreeQ, a unified framework addressing key challenges in DiT quantization. First, to tackle inefficient search and proxy misalignment, we introduce Tree Structured Search (TSS). This DiT-specific approach leverages the architecture's linear properties to traverse the solution space in O(n) time while improving objective accuracy through comparison-based pruning. Second, to unify optimization objectives, we propose Environmental Noise Guidance (ENG), which aligns Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) configurations using a single hyperparameter. Third, to mitigate information bottlenecks in ultra-low-bit regimes, we design the General Monarch Branch (GMB). This structured sparse branch prevents irreversible information loss, enabling finer detail generation. Through extensive experiments, our TreeQ framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on DiT-XL/2 under W3A3 and W4A4 PTQ/PEFT settings.

We argue that the challenge of this conversion stems from a critical yet overlooked issue, i.e., the latent space of semantic encoders lacks the inherent structure to interpret a composite image as a linear superposition of its constituent layers. Our approach is built on three synergistic components, including a reflection-equivariant VAE that aligns the latent space with the linear physics of reflection formation, a learnable task-specific text embedding for precise guidance that bypasses ambiguous language, and a depth-guided early-branching sampling strategy to harness generative stochasticity for promising results.

However, these methods suffer from conflicting optimization directions between physical and digital attack detection under same category prompt spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Spoofing-aware Prompt Learning for Unified Attack Detection (SPL-UAD) framework, which decouples optimization branches for physical and digital attacks in the prompt space.

These AI-generated driving videos (AIGVs) offer a low-cost, scalable alternative to real or simulator data for autonomous driving (AD). But a key question remains: can such videos reliably support training and evaluation of AD models? We present a diagnostic framework that systematically studies this question. First, we introduce a taxonomy of frequent AIGV failure modes, including visual artifacts, physically implausible motion, and violations of traffic semantics, and demonstrate their negative impact on object detection, tracking, and instance segmentation. To support this analysis, we build ADGV-Bench, a driving-focused benchmark with human quality annotations and dense labels for multiple perception tasks. We then propose ADGVE, a driving-aware evaluator that combines static semantics, temporal cues, lane obedience signals, and Vision-Language Model(VLM)-guided reasoning into a single quality score for each clip. Experiments show that blindly adding raw AIGVs can degrade perception performance, while filtering them with ADGVE consistently improves both general video quality assessment metrics and downstream AD models, and turns AIGVs into a beneficial complement to real-world data. Our study highlights both the risks and the promise of AIGVs, and provides practical tools for safely leveraging large-scale video generation in future AD pipelines."}

To address this, AffectNet has tried to add VA (Valence and Arousal) information, but still lacks D(Dominance). Thus, the research introduces VAD annotation on FER2013 dataset, takes the initiative to label D(Dominance) dimension. Then, to further improve network capacity, it enforces orthogonalized convolution on it, which extracts more diverse and expressive features and will finally increase the prediction accuracy. Experiment results show that D dimension could be measured but is difficult to obtain compared with V and A dimension no matter in manual annotation or regression network prediction. Secondly, the ablation test by introducing orthogonal convolution verifies that better VAD prediction could be obtained in the configuration of orthogonal convolution. Therefore, the research provides an initiative labelling for D dimension on FER dataset, and proposes a better prediction network for VAD prediction through orthogonal convolution. The newly built VAD annotated FER2013 dataset could act as a benchmark to measure VAD multidimensional emotions, while the orthogonalized regression network based on ResNet could act as the facial expression recognition baseline for VAD emotion prediction.

This framework co-fuses multi-modal and multi-exposure data, overcoming single-exposure method limitations in extreme environments. The framework begins with region perception-based feature fusion to ensure precise multi-modal registration, followed by adaptive fusion with contrast enhancement.

Among them, next-scale prediction has emerged as a popular paradigm, where models generate images in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, scale-wise AR models suffer from exposure bias, which undermines generation quality. We identify two primary causes of this issue: (1) train-test mismatch, where the model must rely on its own imperfect predictions during inference, and (2) imbalance in scale-wise learning difficulty, where certain scales exhibit disproportionately higher optimization complexity. Through a comprehensive analysis of training dynamics, we propose Self-Autoregressive Refinement (SAR) to address these limitations. SAR introduces a Stagger-Scale Rollout (SSR) mechanism that performs lightweight autoregressive rollouts to expose the model to its own intermediate predictions, thereby aligning train-test patterns, and a complementary Contrastive Student-Forcing Loss (CSFL) that provides adequate supervision for self-generated contexts to ensure stable training. Experimental results show that applying SAR to pretrained AR models consistently improves generation quality with minimal computational overhead. For instance, SAR yields a 5.2% FID reduction on FlexVAR-d16 trained on ImageNet 256 within 10 epochs (5 hours on 32xA100 GPUs). Given its efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness, we expect SAR to serve as a reliable post-training method for visual autoregressive generation."}

We present DragMesh, a robust framework for real-time interactive 3D articulation built around a lightweight motion generation core. Our core contribution is a novel decoupled kinematic reasoning and motion generation framework. First, we infer the latent joint parameters by decoupling semantic intent reasoning (which determines the joint type) from geometric regression (which determines the axis and origin using our Kinematics Prediction Network (KPP-Net)). Second, to leverage the compact, continuous, and singularity-free properties of dual quaternions for representing rigid body motion, we develop a novel Dual Quaternion VAE (DQ-VAE). This DQ-VAE receives these predicted priors, along with the original user drag, to generate a complete, plausible motion trajectory. To ensure strict adherence to kinematics, we inject the joint priors at every layer of the DQ-VAE's non-autoregressive Transformer decoder using FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation) conditioning. This persistent, multi-scale guidance is complemented by a numerically-stable cross-product loss to guarantee axis alignment. This decoupled design allows DragMesh to achieve real-time performance and enables plausible, generative articulation on novel objects without retraining, offering a practical step toward generative 3D intelligence.

Spatial channel attention modules further enhance discriminative localization under occlusion and low resolution. To support large-scale evaluation, we construct U-DetAGReID, a unified long-range gender dataset derived from DetReIDx and AG-ReID.v2, harmonized under a consistent ternary labeling scheme (Male, Female, Unknown).

Existing approaches based on implicit representations like NeRFs suffer from slow rendering and dynamic inconsistencies, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods are typically limited to static head generation, lacking dynamic control. We bridge this gap by introducing AGORA, a novel framework that extends 3DGS within a generative adversarial network to produce animatable avatars. Our key contribution is a lightweight, FLAME-conditioned deformation branch that predicts per-Gaussian residuals, enabling identity-preserving, fine-grained expression control while allowing real-time inference. Expression fidelity is enforced via a dual-discriminator training scheme leveraging synthetic renderings of the parametric mesh. AGORA generates avatars that are not only visually realistic but also precisely controllable. Quantitatively, we outperform state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on expression accuracy while rendering at 250+ FPS on a single GPU, and, notably, at $\\sim$9 FPS under CPU-only inference - representing, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of practical CPU-only animatable 3DGS avatar synthesis.

Multimodal automatic depression detection (ADD) offers a promising solution; however, widely studied audio- and video-based ADD methods lack a unified, generalizable framework for diverse depression recognition scenarios and show limited stability to missing modalities, which are common in real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for Stable Cross-Domain Depression Recognition based on Multimodal Large Language Model (SCD-MLLM). The framework supports the integration and processing of heterogeneous depression-related data collected from varied sources while maintaining stability in the presence of incomplete modality inputs. Specifically, SCD-MLLM introduces two key components: (i) Multi-Source Data Input Adapter (MDIA), which employs masking mechanism and task-specific prompts to transform heterogeneous depression-related inputs into uniform token sequences, addressing inconsistency across diverse data sources; (ii) Modality-Aware Adaptive Fusion Module (MAFM), which adaptively integrates audio and visual features via a shared projection mechanism, enhancing resilience under missing modality conditions. e conduct comprehensive experiments under multi-dataset joint training settings on five publicly available and heterogeneous depression datasets from diverse scenarios: CMDC, AVEC2014, DAIC-WOZ, DVlog, and EATD. Across both complete and partial modality settings, SCD-MLLM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models as well as leading commercial LLMs (Gemini and GPT), demonstrating superior cross-domain generalization, enhanced ability to capture multimodal cues of depression, and strong stability to missing modality cases in real-world applications."}

MediaPipe is chosen primarily for its efficiency and low computational load, enabling the system to run smoothly on edge devices without requiring dedicated hardware. Spoken input from a phone can also be translated into sign representations through a voice-to-sign component that maps detected speech to predefined phrases and produces corresponding GIFs or alphabet-based visualizations. For visually impaired users, the framework provides a screen free voice interface that integrates multilingual speech recognition, text summarization, and text-to-speech generation.

The goal of this study is to design, develop, and validate a comprehensive, multi-modal system that fully automates the monitoring workflow, from data acquisition to the generation of actionable, geo-located maintenance alerts, thereby enhancing plant safety and operational efficiency. The methods employed involve a synergistic architecture that begins with a palette-invariant thermal embedding, learned by enforcing representational consistency, which is fused with a contrast-normalized RGB stream via a gated mechanism. This is supplemented by a closed-loop, adaptive re-acquisition controller that uses Rodrigues-based updates for targeted confirmation of ambiguous anomalies and a geospatial deduplication module that clusters redundant alerts using DBSCAN over the haversine distance. In conclusion, this study establishes a powerful new paradigm for proactive PV inspection, with the proposed system achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.903 on the public PVF-10 benchmark, a significant 12-15% improvement over single-modality baselines.

These interactions can range from minor disturbances, such as raccoons in urban waste bins, to more severe consequences, including species extinction. As a result, the monitoring of wildlife is gaining significance in various contexts. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers a solution by automating the recognition of animals in images and videos, thereby reducing the manual effort required for wildlife monitoring. Traditional AI training involves three main stages: image collection, labelling, and model training. However, the variability, for example, in the landscape (e.g., mountains, open fields, forests), weather (e.g., rain, fog, sunshine), lighting (e.g., day, night), and camera-animal distances presents significant challenges to model robustness and adaptability in real-world scenarios.\n  In this work, we propose a unified framework, called ShadowWolf, designed to address these challenges by integrating and optimizing the stages of AI model training and evaluation. The proposed framework enables dynamic model retraining to adjust to changes in environmental conditions and application requirements, thereby reducing labelling efforts and allowing for on-site model adaptation. This adaptive and unified approach enhances the accuracy and efficiency of wildlife monitoring systems, promoting more effective and scalable conservation efforts."}

Our study presents two main contributions. First, through systematic evaluation across datasets and acquisition paradigms, we show that models trained with learned sampling patterns exhibitimproved generalization under cross-domain settings. Second, we propose a novel method that enhances domain robustness by introducing acquisition uncertainty during training-stochastically perturbing k-space trajectories to simulate variability across scanners and imaging conditions.

With the emergence of Artificial intelligence in the modern world and its vast application in the medical field, we can make an approach to the CAD (Computer Aided Diagnosis) system for the early detection of Brain tumors automatically.

The encoder learns multiscale contextual features using position attention weight excitation blocks, dense atrous blocks, and downsampling operations, effectively capturing both local and global contextual information. The decoder reconstructs high-resolution segmentation masks through upsampling operations, dense atrous blocks, and feature fusion mechanisms, ensuring precise boundary delineation. To further refine segmentation predictions, channel CycleMLP blocks are incorporated into the decoder along the skip connections, enhancing feature integration while maintaining linear computational complexity relative to input size. Experimental results, both quantitative and qualitative, across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of U-CycleMLP in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, achieving better segmentation accuracy across all datasets, capturing fine-grained anatomical structures, and demonstrating robustness across different medical imaging modalities.

Lake Champlain is particularly vulnerable to recurring CyanoHAB events, especially in its northern segment: Missisquoi Bay, St. Albans Bay, and Northeast Arm, due to nutrient enrichment and climatic variability. Remote sensing provides a scalable solution for monitoring and forecasting these events, offering continuous coverage where in situ observations are sparse or unavailable. In this study, we present a remote sensing only forecasting framework that combines Transformers and BiLSTM to predict CyanoHAB intensities up to 14 days in advance. The system utilizes Cyanobacterial Index data from the Cyanobacterial Assessment Network and temperature data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellites to capture long range dependencies and sequential dynamics in satellite time series. The dataset is very sparse, missing more than 30% of the Cyanobacterial Index data and 90% of the temperature data. A two stage preprocessing pipeline addressed data gaps by applying forward fill and weighted temporal imputation at the pixel level, followed by smoothing to reduce the discontinuities of CyanoHAB events. The raw dataset is transformed into meaningful features through equal frequency binning for the Cyanobacterial Index values and extracted temperature statistics.

Recent deep learning approaches improve automation, but most treat diatom recognition as flat classification predicting only one taxonomic rank. We investigate whether embedding taxonomic hierarchy into neural network architectures can improve both accuracy and error locality.\n  We introduce a hierarchical convolutional network with five cascaded heads that jointly predict class, order, family, genus, and species. Each head receives shared backbone features and probability distributions from higher levels, with binary masks restricting predictions to valid descendants during training and inference. Using a filtered dataset of 1,456 diatom images covering 82 species, we compare hierarchical and flat models under identical settings.\n  The hierarchical model matches flat baselines at species level (69.4% accuracy) while outperforming at all upper taxonomic levels. When species predictions fail, errors remain taxonomically local: 92.5 % of misclassified species are correctly predicted at genus level, versus 67.2% for flat baselines. The hierarchical model reduces mean taxonomic distance by 38.2% (1.209 vs. 1.955).\n  Progressive training reveals bidirectional mechanisms: hierarchical constraint masks operate top-down to constrain prediction space, while gradients from fine-grained levels propagate bottom-up through the shared backbone, refining features. This improves class accuracy from 96.2% to 99.5% and yields 6-8% gains at upper levels, producing more robust, interpretable, and biologically aligned predictions for multi-level taxonomic classification."}

We pretrain a Vision Transformer encoder using a masked image modeling objective, then fine-tune the encoder separately for each task. Our results show that MAE pretraining, when combined with appropriate mask ratio tuning, yields a shared encoder that matches or exceeds a ViT trained from scratch. Specifically, at a 90% mask ratio, the fine-tuned classifier achieves macro AUC of 0.968 and accuracy of 88.65%, compared to the scratch baseline (AUC 0.957, accuracy 82.46%).

We address this gap by explicitly modeling personalized viewing behavior as a core factor in description generation. Our method, DEPER (DEscription-PERception persona encoder), learns a subject embedding that captures both linguistic style and viewing behavior, guided by an auxiliary attention-prediction task. A lightweight adapter aligns these embeddings with a frozen vision-language model, enabling few-shot personalization without retraining.

To achieve this, current MLLMs primarily treats bounding boxes as text tokens and generates them autoregressively. However, such autoregressive spatial decoding leads to very-long output sequences, causing spatial errors to accumulated over time and the localization results to progressively drift across a video. To address this, we present a Detector-Empowered Video LLM, short for DEViL, which couples a Video LLM with an open-vocabulary detector (OVD). Specifically, the MLLM and detector are connected via a reference-semantic token (RST) that distills the user query into a rich semantic representation. Unlike tokens that merely serve as spatial prompts or segmentor switches, the RST functions as both a control signal and a replacement for the OVD's text embedding, enabling end-to-end learning of both referential understanding and spatial localization. Furthermore, we propose a tube-mined temporal regularization (TTReg) within OVD, which drives the OVD to generate temporally-consistent queries for target objects, thereby ensuring effective temporal association. Experiments demonstrate that DEViL achieves strong performance across various fine-grained video understanding tasks, particularly STVG and GroundedVQA.

Our key innovation is to reframe slice-to-3D reconstruction as a 3D dynamic scene rendering problem based on Gaussian splatting, where the progression of axial slices is modeled as the temporal evolution of 2D Gaussian point clouds. To enhance fidelity in data-sparse regimes, we incorporate a Teacher-Student bootstrapping mechanism that uses high-confidence predictions on unobserved slices as pseudo-supervisory signals. Compared with diffusion- and GAN-based reconstruction methods, EMGauss substantially improves interpolation quality, enables continuous slice synthesis, and eliminates the need for large-scale pretraining. Beyond vEM, it potentially provides a generalizable slice-to-3D solution across diverse imaging domains."}

Sixteen stroke patients were selected in the research. The skeleton data of the patients performing specific rehabilitation movements were collected using the Kinect depth camera.

Often, this source domain dataset has a distinct distribution to the clients' domains. To address the challenges posed by the FFreeDA setup, adaptation of the Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) methods to FL struggles with client-drift in real-world scenarios due to extreme data heterogeneity caused by the aforementioned domain gaps, resulting in unreliable pseudo-labels.

To probe the core issue, we conduct an empirical analysis and observe two characteristic behaviors: (i) fine-tuning VLMs on high-level semantic supervision strengthens semantic discrimination and well generalize to unseen data; (ii) fine-tuning VLMs on low-level pixel-artifact supervision yields poor transfer. We attribute VLMs' underperformance to task-model misalignment: semantics-oriented VLMs inherently lack sensitivity to fine-grained pixel artifacts, and semantically non-discriminative pixel artifacts thus exceeds their inductive biases. In contrast, we observe that conventional pixel-artifact detectors capture low-level pixel artifacts yet exhibit limited semantic awareness relative to VLMs, highlighting that distinct models are better matched to distinct tasks. In this paper, we formalize AIGI detection as two complementary tasks--semantic consistency checking and pixel-artifact detection--and show that neglecting either induces systematic blind spots. Guided by this view, we introduce the Task-Model Alignment principle and instantiate it as a two-branch detector, AlignGemini, comprising a VLM fine-tuned exclusively with pure semantic supervision and a pixel-artifact expert trained exclusively with pure pixel-artifact supervision. By enforcing orthogonal supervision on two simplified datasets, each branch trains to its strengths, producing complementary discrimination over semantic and pixel cues. On five in-the-wild benchmarks, AlignGemini delivers a +9.5 gain in average accuracy, supporting task-model alignment as an effective path to generalizable AIGI detection."}

This paper introduces a method that jointly optimises camera hardware and adaptive camera control algorithms with downstream vision tasks. We present a unified optimisation framework that integrates gradient-based and derivative-free methods, enabling support for both continuous and discrete parameters, non-differentiable image formation processes, and neural network-based adaptive control algorithms. To address non-differentiable effects such as motion blur, we propose DF-Grad, a hybrid optimisation strategy that trains adaptive control networks using signals from a derivative-free optimiser alongside unsupervised task-driven learning. Experiments show that our method outperforms baselines that optimise static and dynamic parameters separately, particularly under challenging conditions such as low light and fast motion. These results demonstrate that jointly optimising hardware parameters and adaptive control algorithms improves perception performance and provides a unified approach to task-driven camera system design."}

This challenge highlights the urgent need for 3DGS watermarking techniques that are intrinsically resilient to diffusion-based editing. In this paper, we introduce RDSplat, a Robust watermarking paradigm against Diffusion editing for 3D Gaussian Splatting. RDSplat embeds watermarks into 3DGS components that diffusion-based editing inherently preserve, achieved through (i) proactively targeting low-frequency Gaussians and (ii) adversarial training with a diffusion proxy. Specifically, we introduce a multi-domain framework that operates natively in 3DGS space and embeds watermarks into diffusion-editing-preserved low-frequency Gaussians via coordinated covariance regularization and 2D filtering. In addition, we exploit the low-pass filtering behavior of diffusion-based editing by using Gaussian blur as an efficient training surrogate, enabling adversarial fine-tuning that further enhances watermark robustness against diffusion-based editing. Empirically, comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RDSplat not only maintains superior robustness under diffusion-based editing, but also preserves watermark invisibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}

To mitigate these issues, we propose an efficient unified video creation model, named VDOT. Concretely, we model the training process with the distribution matching distillation (DMD) paradigm. Instead of using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimization, we additionally employ a novel computational optimal transport (OT) technique to optimize the discrepancy between the real and fake score distributions. The OT distance inherently imposes geometric constraints, mitigating potential zero-forcing or gradient collapse issues that may arise during KL-based distillation within the few-step generation scenario, and thus, enhances the efficiency and stability of the distillation process. Further, we integrate a discriminator to enable the model to perceive real video data, thereby enhancing the quality of generated videos. To support training unified video creation models, we propose a fully automated pipeline for video data annotation and filtering that accommodates multiple video creation tasks.

To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Reconstruction-based Multimodal Adapter (RMAdapter), which leverages a dual-branch architecture. Unlike conventional single-branch adapters, RMAdapter consists of: (1) an adaptation branch that injects task-specific knowledge through parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and (2) a reconstruction branch that preserves general knowledge by reconstructing latent space features back into the original feature space. This design facilitates a dynamic balance between general and task-specific knowledge. Importantly, although RMAdapter introduces an additional reconstruction branch, it is carefully optimized to remain lightweight. By computing reconstruction loss locally at each layer and sharing projection modules, the overall computational overhead is kept minimal. A consistency constraint is also incorporated to better regulate the trade-off between discriminability and generalization. We comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of RMAdapter on three representative tasks: generalization to new categories, generalization to new target datasets, and domain generalization. Without relying on data augmentation or duplicate prompt designs, our RMAdapter consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across all evaluation metrics."}

However, current approaches sharing dense Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features are constrained by quadratically-scaling communication costs and the lack of flexibility and interpretability for precise alignment across asynchronous or disparate viewpoints. While emerging sparse query-based methods offer an alternative, they often suffer from inadequate geometric representations, suboptimal fusion strategies, and training instability. In this paper, we propose SparseCoop, a fully sparse cooperative perception framework for 3D detection and tracking that completely discards intermediate BEV representations. Our framework features a trio of innovations: a kinematic-grounded instance query that uses an explicit state vector with 3D geometry and velocity for precise spatio-temporal alignment; a coarse-to-fine aggregation module for robust fusion; and a cooperative instance denoising task to accelerate and stabilize training. Experiments on V2X-Seq and Griffin datasets show SparseCoop achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it delivers this with superior computational efficiency, low transmission cost, and strong robustness to communication latency.

In recent years, weakly-supervised VAD (WVAD) have attracted considerable attention due to their easy annotation process and promising research results. While existing WVAD methods tackle mainly on static datasets, the possibility that the domain of data can vary has been neglected. To adapt such domain-shift, the continual learning (CL) perspective is required because otherwise additional training only with new coming data could easily cause performance degradation for previous data, i.e., forgetting. Therefore, we propose a brand-new approach, called Continual Anomaly Detection with Ensembles (CADE) that is the first work combining CL and WVAD viewpoints. Specifically, CADE uses the Dual-Generator(DG) to address data imbalance and label uncertainty in WVAD. We also found that forgetting exacerbates the \"incompleteness'' where the model becomes biased towards certain anomaly modes, leading to missed detections of various anomalies. To address this, we propose to ensemble Multi-Discriminator (MD) that capture missed anomalies in past scenes due to forgetting, using multiple models. Extensive experiments show that CADE significantly outperforms existing VAD methods on the common multi-scene VAD datasets, such as ShanghaiTech and Charlotte Anomaly datasets."}

We address this by training without any real abnormal videos while evaluating under the standard weakly supervised split, and we introduce PA-VAD, a generation-driven approach that learns a detector from synthesized pseudo-abnormal videos paired with real normal videos, using only a small set of real normal images to drive synthesis. For synthesis, we select class-relevant initial images with CLIP and refine textual prompts with a vision-language model to improve fidelity and scene consistency before invoking a video diffusion model. For training, we mitigate excessive spatiotemporal magnitude in synthesized anomalies by an domain-aligned regularized module that combines domain alignment and memory usage-aware updates. Extensive experiments show that our approach reaches 98.2% on ShanghaiTech and 82.5% on UCF-Crime, surpassing the strongest real-abnormal method on ShanghaiTech by +0.6% and outperforming the UVAD state-of-the-art on UCF-Crime by +1.9%. The results demonstrate that high-accuracy anomaly detection can be obtained without collecting real anomalies, providing a practical path toward scalable deployment."}

We introduce a weakly supervised method trained solely on vertebra-level healthy/malignant labels, without any lesion masks. The method combines a Diffusion Autoencoder (DAE) that produces a classifier-guided healthy edit of each vertebra with pixel-wise difference maps that propose candidate lesion regions. To determine which regions truly reflect malignancy, we introduce Hide-and-Seek Attribution: each candidate is revealed in turn while all others are hidden, the edited image is projected back to the data manifold by the DAE, and a latent-space classifier quantifies the isolated malignant contribution of that component. High-scoring regions form the final lytic or blastic segmentation. On held-out radiologist annotations, we achieve strong blastic/lytic performance despite no mask supervision (F1: 0.91/0.85; Dice: 0.87/0.78), exceeding baselines (F1: 0.79/0.67; Dice: 0.74/0.55).

This property makes it can well exploit the intrinsic merits of both text and visual modalities, i.e., granular attribute referring and uncommon object grounding, respectively. Besides, OmniRIS can also handle various segmentation settings, such as one v.s. many and many v.s. many, further facilitating its practical use. To promote the research of OmniRIS, we also rigorously design and construct a large dataset termed OmniRef, which consists of 186,939 omni-prompts for 30,956 images, and establish a comprehensive evaluation system. Moreover, a strong and general baseline termed OmniSegNet is also proposed to tackle the key challenges of OmniRIS, such as omni-prompt encoding. The extensive experiments not only validate the capability of OmniSegNet in following omni-modal instructions, but also show the superiority of OmniRIS for highly generalized image segmentation."}

However, this paradigm is limited by the drive-time perception horizon and often fails under limited view scope, occlusion or extreme conditions such as darkness and rain. In contrast, human drivers are able to recall road structure even under poor visibility. To endow models with this ``recall\" ability, we propose the spatial retrieval paradigm, introducing offline retrieved geographic images as an additional input. These images are easy to obtain from offline caches (e.g, Google Maps or stored autonomous driving datasets) without requiring additional sensors, making it a plug-and-play extension for existing AD tasks.\n  For experiments, we first extend the nuScenes dataset with geographic images retrieved via Google Maps APIs and align the new data with ego-vehicle trajectories. We establish baselines across five core autonomous driving tasks: object detection, online mapping, occupancy prediction, end-to-end planning, and generative world modeling. Extensive experiments show that the extended modality could enhance the performance of certain tasks. We will open-source dataset curation code, data, and benchmarks for further study of this new autonomous driving paradigm."}

While existing keyframe sampling methods can improve temporal modeling efficiency, additional computational cost is introduced before feature encoding, and the binary frame selection paradigm is found suboptimal. Therefore, in this work, we propose Dynamic Token compression via LLM-guided Keyframe prior (DyToK), a training-free paradigm that enables dynamic token compression by harnessing VLLMs' inherent attention mechanisms. Our analysis reveals that VLLM attention layers naturally encoding query-conditioned keyframe priors, by which DyToK dynamically adjusts per-frame token retention ratios, prioritizing semantically rich frames while suppressing redundancies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyToK achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs. DyToK shows plug-and-play compatibility with existing compression methods, such as VisionZip and FastV, attaining 4.3x faster inference while preserving accuracy across multiple VLLMs, such as LLaVA-OneVision and Qwen2.5-VL.

To address this issue, we propose ECOCSeg, a novel perspective for segmentation models that utilizes error-correcting output codes (ECOC) to create a fine-grained encoding for each class. ECOCSeg offers several advantages. First, an ECOC-based classifier is introduced, enabling model to disentangle classes into attributes and handle partial inaccurate bits, improving stability and generalization in pseudo-label learning. Second, a bit-level label denoising mechanism is developed to generate higher-quality pseudo-labels, providing adequate and robust supervision for unlabeled images. ECOCSeg can be easily integrated with existing methods and consistently demonstrates significant improvements on multiple UDA and SSL benchmarks across different segmentation architectures.

Despite recent progress with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), the task remains challenging due to variations in spatial resolution, viewpoint, orientation, and background conditions, which often reduce the generalization ability of existing models. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight architecture based on the convolutional mixer paradigm. The model alternates between spatial mixing through depthwise convolutions at multiple scales and channel mixing through pointwise operations, enabling efficient extraction of both local and contextual information while keeping the number of parameters and computations low. Extensive experiments were conducted on the AID and EuroSAT benchmarks. The proposed model achieved overall accuracy, average accuracy, and Kappa values of 74.7%, 74.57%, and 73.79 on the AID dataset, and 93.90%, 93.93%, and 93.22 on EuroSAT, respectively.

Supplementary video and poster available upon request", "summary": "Reliable 3D segmentation is critical for understanding complex scenes with dense layouts and multi-scale objects, as commonly seen in industrial environments. In such scenarios, heavy occlusion weakens geometric boundaries between objects, and large differences in object scale will cause end-to-end models fail to capture both coarse and fine details accurately. Existing 3D point-based methods require costly annotations, while image-guided methods often suffer from semantic inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical image-guided 3D segmentation framework that progressively refines segmentation from instance-level to part-level. Instance segmentation involves rendering a top-view image and projecting SAM-generated masks prompted by YOLO-World back onto the 3D point cloud. Part-level segmentation is subsequently performed by rendering multi-view images of each instance obtained from the previous stage and applying the same 2D segmentation and back-projection process at each view, followed by Bayesian updating fusion to ensure semantic consistency across views. Experiments on real-world factory data demonstrate that our method effectively handles occlusion and structural complexity, achieving consistently high per-class mIoU scores. Additional evaluations on public dataset confirm the generalization ability of our framework, highlighting its robustness, annotation efficiency, and adaptability to diverse 3D environments."}

However, existing methods still face two major challenges: their U-Net-based architectures constrain the visual quality of the generated panoramas, and they usually treat the two core tasks independently, which leads to modeling redundancy and inefficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint-face panorama (JoPano) generation approach that unifies the two core tasks within a DiT-based model. To transfer the rich generative capabilities of existing DiT backbones learned from natural images to the panorama domain, we propose a Joint-Face Adapter built on the cubemap representation of panoramas, which enables a pretrained DiT to jointly model and generate different views of a panorama. We further apply Poisson Blending to reduce seam inconsistencies that often appear at the boundaries between cube faces. Correspondingly, we introduce Seam-SSIM and Seam-Sobel metrics to quantitatively evaluate the seam consistency. Moreover, we propose a condition switching mechanism that unifies text-to-panorama and view-to-panorama tasks within a single model. Comprehensive experiments show that JoPano can generate high-quality panoramas for both text-to-panorama and view-to-panorama generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on FID, CLIP-FID, IS, and CLIP-Score metrics."}

To address this issue, we propose Balanced Learning for Domain Adaptation (BLDA), a novel approach to directly assess and alleviate class bias without requiring prior knowledge about the distribution shift. First, we identify over-predicted and under-predicted classes by analyzing the distribution of predicted logits. Subsequently, we introduce a post-hoc approach to align the logits distributions across different classes using shared anchor distributions. To further consider the network's need to generate unbiased pseudo-labels during self-training, we estimate logits distributions online and incorporate logits correction terms into the loss function. Moreover, we leverage the resulting cumulative density as domain-shared structural knowledge to connect the source and target domains.

In clinical practice, surgeons rely heavily on precise anatomical understanding to interpret, review, and learn from surgical videos. To fill this gap, we introduce the Neurosurgical Anatomy Benchmark (NeuroABench), the first multimodal benchmark explicitly created to evaluate anatomical understanding in the neurosurgical domain. NeuroABench consists of 9 hours of annotated neurosurgical videos covering 89 distinct procedures and is developed using a novel multimodal annotation pipeline with multiple review cycles. The benchmark evaluates the identification of 68 clinical anatomical structures, providing a rigorous and standardized framework for assessing model performance. Experiments on over 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant limitations, with the best-performing model achieving only 40.87% accuracy in anatomical identification tasks. To further evaluate the benchmark, we extract a subset of the dataset and conduct an informative test with four neurosurgical trainees. The results show that the best-performing student achieves 56% accuracy, with the lowest scores of 28% and an average score of 46.5%. While the best MLLM performs comparably to the lowest-scoring student, it still lags significantly behind the group's average performance.

To this end, we introduce Neural Tissue Relation Modeling (NTRM), a novel segmentation framework that augments CNNs with a tissue-level graph neural network to model spatial and functional relationships across tissue types. NTRM constructs a graph over predicted regions, propagates contextual information via message passing, and refines segmentation through spatial projection. Unlike prior methods, NTRM explicitly encodes inter-tissue dependencies, enabling structurally coherent predictions in boundary-dense zones.

In this paper, we establish the importance of measuring high-level fidelity for SR models as a complementary criterion to reveal the reliability of generative SR models. We construct the first annotated dataset with fidelity scores from different SR models, and evaluate how state-of-the-art (SOTA) SR models actually perform in preserving high-level fidelity. Based on the dataset, we then analyze how existing image quality metrics correlate with fidelity measurement, and further show that this high-level task can be better addressed by foundation models. Finally, by fine-tuning SR models based on our fidelity feedback, we show that both semantic fidelity and perceptual quality can be improved, demonstrating the potential value of our proposed criteria, both in model evaluation and optimization. We will release the dataset, code, and models upon acceptance."}

Current transformer-based detectors, while powerful, struggle with three critical issues. First, features degrade severely as networks downsample progressively. Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily.\n  We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency.\n  We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets. Results show mAP50 scores of 92.9% and 51.6% respectively-both state-of-the-art. The model stays lightweight with just 11.7M parameters and 41.2 GFLOPs.

To address these limitations, COREA introduces a coarse-to-fine bidirectional 3D-to-3D alignment strategy that allows geometric signals to be learned directly in 3D space.

Therefore, we propose to use an energy function to impose constraints on the attention map extracted through the generation process. Thus, at each generation step, the attention can be more focused on the clothing region of interest, thereby influencing the generation results to be more consistent with the target clothing details.

MulCLIP first preserves global contrastive alignment between images and both summary and long captions, while extending positional embeddings for longer text sequences. To further enhance fine-grained understanding, we propose two novel strategies: (1) a token reconstruction alignment over locally calibrated features to strengthen semantic connections between words and image patches, and (2) a subcaption-aggregated patch alignment that automatically extracts and aggregates context-rich patches for each subcaption.

This reveals a critical flaw: single-pass reasoning may overlook explicit harmful content in its own output. Our key insight is to exploit this wasted signal through reflection, which can effectively leverage the malicious content revealed in the first-pass reasoning to enable genuine self-correction and prevent unsafe generations.

Moreover, the absence of ground-truth fused images and the small scale of existing datasets make it difficult to train an end-to-end model that simultaneously understands high-level semantics and performs fine-grained multimodal alignment. We therefore present DiTFuse, instruction-driven Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) framework that performs end-to-end, semantics-aware fusion within a single model. By jointly encoding two images and natural-language instructions in a shared latent space, DiTFuse enables hierarchical and fine-grained control over fusion dynamics, overcoming the limitations of pre-fusion and post-fusion pipelines that struggle to inject high-level semantics. The training phase employs a multi-degradation masked-image modeling strategy, so the network jointly learns cross-modal alignment, modality-invariant restoration, and task-aware feature selection without relying on ground truth images. A curated, multi-granularity instruction dataset further equips the model with interactive fusion capabilities. DiTFuse unifies infrared-visible, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion-as well as text-controlled refinement and downstream tasks-within a single architecture.

Leveraging spatial and textual learning, START delivers consistent gains across model sizes and benchmarks over the base models and surpasses prior state-of-the-art by a clear margin.

However, such networks either emphasize pixel-intensity features instead of fundamental anatomical structures (e.g., those encoded by topological invariants), or they capture only simple topological features via single-parameter persistence. In this paper, we propose a new topology-guided classification framework that extracts multi-scale and multi-filtration persistent topological features and integrates them into vision classification backbones. For an input image, we first compute cubical persistence diagrams (PDs) across multiple image resolutions/scales. We then develop a ``vineyard'' algorithm that consolidates these PDs into a single, stable diagram capturing signatures at varying granularities, from global anatomy to subtle local irregularities that may indicate early-stage disease. To further exploit richer topological representations produced by multiple filtrations, we design a cross-attention-based neural network that directly processes the consolidated final PDs. The resulting topological embeddings are fused with feature maps from CNNs or Transformers. By integrating multi-scale and multi-filtration topologies into an end-to-end architecture, our approach enhances the model's capacity to recognize complex anatomical structures. Evaluations on three public datasets show consistent, considerable improvements over strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the value of our comprehensive topological perspective for robust and interpretable medical image classification."}

Traditional level set methods, while effective in certain cases, often depend on approximate bias field estimations and therefore struggle under severe non-uniform imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel variational Reflectance-based Level Set Model (RefLSM), which explicitly integrates Retinex-inspired reflectance decomposition into the segmentation framework. By decomposing the observed image into reflectance and bias field components, RefLSM directly segments the reflectance, which is invariant to illumination and preserves fine structural details. Building on this foundation, we introduce two key innovations for enhanced precision and robustness. First, a linear structural prior steers the smoothed reflectance gradients toward a data-driven reference, providing reliable geometric guidance in noisy or low-contrast scenes. Second, a relaxed binary level-set is embedded in RefLSM and enforced via convex relaxation and sign projection, yielding stable evolution and avoiding reinitialization-induced diffusion. The resulting variational problem is solved efficiently using an ADMM-based optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrate that RefLSM achieves superior segmentation accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art level set methods."}

However, these methods typically estimate the entropy of VQ indices using a static, global probability distribution, which fails to adapt to the specific content of each image. This non-adaptive approach leads to untapped bitrate potential and challenges in achieving flexible rate control. To address this challenge, we introduce a Controllable Generative Image Compression framework based on a VQ Hyperprior, termed HVQ-CGIC. HVQ-CGIC rigorously derives the mathematical foundation for introducing a hyperprior to the VQ indices entropy model. Based on this foundation, through novel loss design, to our knowledge, this framework is the first to introduce RD balance and control into vector quantization-based Generative Image Compression. Cooperating with a lightweight hyper-prior estimation network, HVQ-CGIC achieves a significant advantage in rate-distortion (RD) performance compared to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative compression methods. On the Kodak dataset, we achieve the same LPIPS as Control-GIC, CDC and HiFiC with an average of 61.3% fewer bits. We posit that HVQ-CGIC has the potential to become a foundational component for VQGAN-based image compression, analogous to the integral role of the HyperPrior framework in neural image compression."}

These connections form Chains-of-Reasoning (CoRs) within the image, enabling viewers to infer events, causal relationships, and other information, thereby understanding the underlying story. In this paper, we focus on these semantically rich images and define them as Storytelling Images. Such images have diverse applications beyond illustration creation and cognitive screening, leveraging their ability to convey multi-layered information visually and inspire active interpretation. However, due to their complex semantic nature, Storytelling Images are inherently challenging to create, and thus remain relatively scarce. To address this challenge, we introduce the Storytelling Image Generation task, which explores how generative AI models can be leveraged to create such images. Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline, StorytellingPainter, which combines the creative reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the visual synthesis capabilities of Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate Storytelling Images. Alongside this pipeline, we develop a dedicated evaluation framework comprising three main evaluators: a Semantic Complexity Evaluator, a KNN-based Diversity Evaluator and a Story-Image Alignment Evaluator. Given the critical role of story generation in the Storytelling Image Generation task and the performance disparity between open-source and proprietary LLMs, we further explore tailored training strategies to reduce this gap, resulting in a series of lightweight yet effective models named Mini-Storytellers.

Motivated by this, we propose Expectation Over Learned distribution of Transformation (EOLT), the framework to treat transformation distribution as a learnable component rather than a fixed design choice. Specifically, EOLT employs a policy network that learns to automatically prioritize critical transformations and adaptively generate instance-specific perturbations via reinforcement learning, enabling explicit modeling of defensive bottlenecks while maintaining broad transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, with 26% higher average robustness and up to 30% gains on challenging transformation categories."}

In order to overcome these limitations, this work proposes a hybrid deep learning model based on SqueezeNet v1 which is a lightweight model, and EfficientNet-B0, which is a high-performing model, and is enhanced with handcrafted radiomic descriptors, including Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gabor filters and Wavelet transforms. The framework was trained and tested only on publicly available Nickparvar Brain Tumor MRI dataset, which consisted of 7,023 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted axial MRI slices which were categorized into four groups: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The testing accuracy of the model was 98.93% that reached a level of 99.08% with Test Time Augmentation (TTA) showing great generalization and power. The proposed hybrid network offers a compromise between computation efficiency and diagnostic accuracy compared to current deep learning structures and only has to be trained using fewer than 2.1 million parameters and less than 1.2 GFLOPs.

We propose TEXTER, which overcomes this limitation by isolating decision-critical features before alignment. TEXTER identifies the neurons contributing to the prediction and emphasizes the features encoded in those neurons -- i.e., the decision-critical features. It then maps these emphasized features into the CLIP feature space to retrieve textual explanations that reflect the model's reasoning.

Although imperceptible adversarial perturbations against diffusion models have proven effective for protecting 2D images, applying them to 3DGS encounters two major challenges: view-generalizable protection and balancing invisibility with protection capability. In this work, we propose the first editing safeguard for 3DGS, termed AdLift, which prevents instruction-driven editing across arbitrary views and dimensions by lifting strictly bounded 2D adversarial perturbations into 3D Gaussian-represented safeguard. To ensure both adversarial perturbations effectiveness and invisibility, these safeguard Gaussians are progressively optimized across training views using a tailored Lifted PGD, which first conducts gradient truncation during back-propagation from the editing model at the rendered image and applies projected gradients to strictly constrain the image-level perturbation. Then, the resulting perturbation is backpropagated to the safeguard Gaussian parameters via an image-to-Gaussian fitting operation. We alternate between gradient truncation and image-to-Gaussian fitting, yielding consistent adversarial-based protection performance across different viewpoints and generalizes to novel views. Empirically, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdLift effectively protects against state-of-the-art instruction-driven 2D image and 3DGS editing."}

SMILE introduces three key ideas: (1) structure-aware supervision that follows true organ boundaries and contrast patterns; (2) registration-free learning that works directly with unaligned multi-phase CT scans; (3) unified inference that provides fast and consistent enhancement across all contrast phases. Across six external datasets, SMILE outperforms existing methods in image quality (14.2% higher SSIM, 20.6% higher PSNR, 50% better FID) and in clinical usefulness by producing anatomically accurate and diagnostically meaningful images.

To address this challenge, we propose a degradation-aware framework for endoscopic video enhancement, which enables real-time, high-quality enhancement by propagating degradation representations across frames. In our framework, degradation representations are first extracted from images using contrastive learning. We then introduce a fusion mechanism that modulates image features with these representations to guide a single-frame enhancement model, which is trained with a cycle-consistency constraint between degraded and restored images to improve robustness and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of degradation-aware modeling for real-time endoscopic video enhancement. Nevertheless, our method suggests that implicitly learning and propagating degradation representation offer a practical pathway for clinical application."}

Then, to improve sentence-level semantic misalignment, we introduce a GRPO-based optimization strategy that fine-tunes the SLT-SFT model with a reward function combining translation fidelity (BLEU) and sentence completeness (ROUGE), yielding the optimized model termed SLT-GRPO. Our conceptually simple framework yields substantial gains under the gloss-free SLT setting without pre-training on any external large-scale sign language datasets, improving BLEU-4 scores by +5.1, +1.11, +1.4, and +1.61 on the CSL-Daily, PHOENIX-2014T, How2Sign, and OpenASL datasets, respectively.

Current methodologies depend on costly, specialized sensors (e.g., LiDAR and multispectral), which restrict global accessibility. Existing sensor-based and rule-driven methods further struggle with tasks requiring the integration of multiple 3D cues, handling diverse queries, and providing interpretable reasoning. We hereby present Geo3DVQA, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in height-aware, 3D geospatial reasoning using RGB-only remote sensing imagery. Unlike conventional sensor-based frameworks, Geo3DVQA emphasizes realistic scenarios that integrate elevation, sky view factors, and land cover patterns. The benchmark encompasses 110k curated question-answer pairs spanning 16 task categories across three complexity levels: single-feature inference, multi-feature reasoning, and application-level spatial analysis. The evaluation of ten state-of-the-art VLMs highlights the difficulty of RGB-to-3D reasoning. GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash achieved only 28.6% and 33.0% accuracy respectively, while domain-specific fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B achieved 49.6% (+24.8 points). These results reveal both the limitations of current VLMs and the effectiveness of domain adaptation.

However, such methods face limitations when applied to UAV imagery, which presents challenges like target confusion, scale variations, and complex backgrounds. These challenges arise because VLMs' understanding of image content depends on the semantic alignment between visual and textual tokens. When the task prompt is simplistic and the image content is complex, achieving effective alignment becomes difficult, limiting the model's ability to focus on task-relevant information. To address this issue, we introduce AerialVP, the first agent framework for task prompt enhancement in UAV image perception. AerialVP proactively extracts multi-dimensional auxiliary information from UAV images to enhance task prompts, overcoming the limitations of traditional VLM-based approaches. Specifically, the enhancement process includes three stages: (1) analyzing the task prompt to identify the task type and enhancement needs, (2) selecting appropriate tools from the tool repository, and (3) generating enhanced task prompts based on the analysis and selected tools. To evaluate AerialVP, we introduce AerialSense, a comprehensive benchmark for UAV image perception that includes Aerial Visual Reasoning, Aerial Visual Question Answering, and Aerial Visual Grounding tasks. AerialSense provides a standardized basis for evaluating model generalization and performance across diverse resolutions, lighting conditions, and both urban and natural scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that AerialVP significantly enhances task prompt guidance, leading to stable and substantial performance improvements in both open-source and proprietary VLMs. Our work will be available at https://github.com/lostwolves/AerialVP."}

In this work, we demonstrate that this \"Inductive Bottleneck\" is not an architectural artifact, but a data-dependent adaptation. By analyzing the layer-wise Effective Encoding Dimension (EED) of DINO-trained ViTs across datasets of varying compositional complexity (UC Merced, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR-100), we show that the depth of the bottleneck correlates strongly with the semantic abstraction required by the task.

However, T2I models exhibit limitations resulting from prior view bias, which produces conflicting appearances between different views of an object. This bias causes subject-words to preferentially activate prior view features during cross-attention (CA) computation, regardless of the target view condition. To overcome this limitation, we conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis to reveal the root cause of the prior view bias in T2I models. Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians. Notably, HAM facilitates semantic-specific interventions, enabling controllable and precise 3D editing. Extensive experiments firmly establish that TD-Attn has the potential to serve as a universal plugin, significantly enhancing multi-view consistency across 3D tasks."}

Leveraging powerful proprietary models, we synthesize a rich amount of balanced composite images, followed by human-in-the-loop filtering and refinement, resulting in MICo-150K, a comprehensive dataset for MICo with identity consistency.

To address this gap, we propose DeepAgent, an advanced multi-agent collaboration framework that simultaneously incorporates both visual and audio modalities for the effective detection of deepfakes. DeepAgent consists of two complementary agents. Agent-1 examines each video with a streamlined AlexNet-based CNN to identify the symbols of deepfake manipulation, while Agent-2 detects audio-visual inconsistencies by combining acoustic features, audio transcriptions from Whisper, and frame-reading sequences of images through EasyOCR. Their decisions are fused through a Random Forest meta-classifier that improves final performance by taking advantage of the different decision boundaries learned by each agent. This study evaluates the proposed framework using three benchmark datasets to demonstrate both component-level and fused performance. Agent-1 achieves a test accuracy of 94.35% on the combined Celeb-DF and FakeAVCeleb datasets. On the FakeAVCeleb dataset, Agent-2 and the final meta-classifier attain accuracies of 93.69% and 81.56%, respectively.

However, due to CLIP's pre-training nature on image-text pairs, it tends to focus on global semantic alignment, resulting in suboptimal performance when associating fine-grained visual regions with text. This leads to noisy and inconsistent predictions, particularly in local areas. We attribute this to a dispersed bias stemming from its contrastive training paradigm, which is difficult to alleviate using CLIP features alone. To address this, we propose a structure-aware feature rectification approach that incorporates instance-specific priors derived directly from the image. Specifically, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) based on low-level features (e.g., colour and texture) to capture local structural relationships and use it to refine CLIP features by enhancing local discrimination.

To fill this gap, we propose a new multi-modal visual tracking task termed UAV-Anti-UAV, which involves a pursuer UAV tracking a target adversarial UAV in the video stream. Compared to existing Anti-UAV tasks, UAV-Anti-UAV is more challenging due to severe dual-dynamic disturbances caused by the rapid motion of both the capturing platform and the target.

In a HIT, an object is first static relative to the scene, then is held in hand following contact, where its pose changes. This is usually followed by a firm grip during use, before it is released to be static again w.r.t. to the scene. We model these pose constraints over the HIT, and propose to propagate the object's pose along the HIT enabling superior reconstruction using our proposed Constrained Optimisation and Propagation (COP) framework. Importantly, we focus on timelines with stable grasps - i.e. where the hand is stably holding an object, effectively maintaining constant contact during use. This allows us to efficiently annotate, study, and evaluate object reconstruction in videos without 3D ground truth. We evaluate our proposed task, ROHIT, over two egocentric datasets, HOT3D and in-the-wild EPIC-Kitchens. In HOT3D, we curate 1.2K clips of stable grasps. In EPIC-Kitchens, we annotate 2.4K clips of stable grasps including 390 object instances across 9 categories from videos of daily interactions in 141 environments. Without 3D ground truth, we utilise 2D projection error to assess the reconstruction. Quantitatively, COP improves stable grasp reconstruction by 6.2-11.3% and HIT reconstruction by up to 24.5% with constrained pose propagation."}

However, existing methods are largely confined to single-agent scenarios, overlooking the physically plausible interplay essential for multi-agent interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose InterAgent, the first end-to-end framework for text-driven physics-based multi-agent humanoid control. At its core, we introduce an autoregressive diffusion transformer equipped with multi-stream blocks, which decouples proprioception, exteroception, and action to mitigate cross-modal interference while enabling synergistic coordination. We further propose a novel interaction graph exteroception representation that explicitly captures fine-grained joint-to-joint spatial dependencies to facilitate network learning. Additionally, within it we devise a sparse edge-based attention mechanism that dynamically prunes redundant connections and emphasizes critical inter-agent spatial relations, thereby enhancing the robustness of interaction modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterAgent consistently outperforms multiple strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

In particular, it is crucial to capture the influence that the presence of an individual can have on the others. Important examples of applications include crowd simulation and emergency management, where the simulation of the mass of people passes through the simulation of the individuals, taking into consideration the others as part of the general context. While existing solutions basically start from some preconceived behavioural model, in this work we propose an approach that starts directly from the data, adopting a data mining perspective. Our method searches the mobility events in the data that might be possible evidences of mutual interactions between individuals, and on top of them looks for complex, persistent patterns and time evolving configurations of events. The study of these patterns can provide new insights on the mechanics of mobility interactions between individuals, which can potentially help in improving existing simulation models. We instantiate the general methodology on two real case studies, one on cars and one on pedestrians, and a full experimental evaluation is performed, both in terms of performances, parameter sensitivity and interpretation of sample results."}

Increasingly driven by deep learning, these models learn to approximate data distributions from training examples. This often results in outputs that gravitate toward the average, potentially masking diagnostically important features. More critically, they can introduce hallucinated content, artifacts that appear realistic but are not present in the original tissue, posing a serious threat to downstream analysis. These hallucinations are nearly impossible to detect visually, and current evaluation practices often overlook them. In this work, we demonstrate that the risk of hallucinations is real and underappreciated. While many methods perform adequately on public datasets, we observe a concerning frequency of hallucinations when these same models are retrained and evaluated on real-world clinical data. To address this, we propose a novel image comparison measure designed to automatically detect hallucinations in normalized outputs. Using this measure, we systematically evaluate several well-cited normalization methods retrained on real-world data, revealing significant inconsistencies and failures that are not captured by conventional metrics. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, interpretable normalization techniques and stricter validation protocols in clinical deployment."}

VideoCoF enforces a ``see, reason, then edit\" procedure by compelling the video diffusion model to first predict reasoning tokens (edit-region latents) before generating the target video tokens. This explicit reasoning step removes the need for user-provided masks while achieving precise instruction-to-region alignment and fine-grained video editing.

To overcome these challenges, we propose S2VC, a Single-Step diffusion based Video Codec that integrates a conditional coding framework with an efficient single-step diffusion generator, enabling realistic reconstruction at low bitrates with reduced sampling cost. Recognizing the importance of semantic conditioning in single-step diffusion, we introduce Contextual Semantic Guidance to extract frame-adaptive semantics from buffered features.

In addition, Temporal Consistency Guidance is incorporated into the diffusion U-Net to enforce temporal coherence across frames and ensure stable generation. Extensive experiments show that S2VC delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with an average 52.73% bitrate saving over prior perceptual methods, underscoring the promise of single-step diffusion for efficient, high-quality video compression."}

Most existing detectors implicitly assume temporally consistent and clean facial sequences, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world scenarios where compression artifacts, occlusions, and adversarial attacks destabilize face detection and often lead to invalid or misdetected faces. To address these challenges, we propose a Laplacian-Regularized Graph Convolutional Network (LR-GCN) that robustly detects DeepFakes from noisy or unordered face sequences, while being trained only on clean facial data. Our method constructs an Order-Free Temporal Graph Embedding (OF-TGE) that organizes frame-wise CNN features into an adaptive sparse graph based on semantic affinities. Unlike traditional methods constrained by strict temporal continuity, OF-TGE captures intrinsic feature consistency across frames, making it resilient to shuffled, missing, or heavily corrupted inputs. We further impose a dual-level sparsity mechanism on both graph structure and node features to suppress the influence of invalid faces. Crucially, we introduce an explicit Graph Laplacian Spectral Prior that acts as a high-pass operator in the graph spectral domain, highlighting structural anomalies and forgery artifacts, which are then consolidated by a low-pass GCN aggregation. This sequential design effectively realizes a task-driven spectral band-pass mechanism that suppresses background information and random noise while preserving manipulation cues. Extensive experiments on FF++, Celeb-DFv2, and DFDC demonstrate that LR-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improved robustness under severe global and local disruptions, including missing faces, occlusions, and adversarially perturbed face detections."}

However, multimodal representations often suffer from modality dominance, redundant information coupling, and spurious cross-modal correlations, leading to suboptimal generalization and limited interpretability. In particular, high-variance modalities tend to overshadow weaker but semantically important signals, while naïve fusion strategies entangle modality-shared and modality-specific factors in an uncontrolled manner. This makes it difficult to understand which modality actually drives a prediction and to maintain robustness when some modalities are noisy or missing. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Residual Semantic Decorrelation Network (DSRSD-Net), a simple yet effective framework that disentangles modality-specific and modality-shared information through residual decomposition and explicit semantic decorrelation constraints. DSRSD-Net introduces: (1) a dual-stream representation learning module that separates intra-modal (private) and inter-modal (shared) latent factors via residual projection; (2) a residual semantic alignment head that maps shared factors from different modalities into a common space using a combination of contrastive and regression-style objectives; and (3) a decorrelation and orthogonality loss that regularizes the covariance structure of the shared space while enforcing orthogonality between shared and private streams, thereby suppressing cross-modal redundancy and preventing feature collapse. Experimental results on two large-scale educational benchmarks demonstrate that DSRSD-Net consistently improves next-step prediction and final outcome prediction over strong single-modality, early-fusion, late-fusion, and co-attention baselines."}

Demystifying Token Pruning in VLLMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) incur high computational costs due to their reliance on hundreds of visual tokens to represent images. While token pruning offers a promising solution for accelerating inference, this paper, however, identifies a key observation: in deeper layers (e.g., beyond the 20th), existing training-free pruning methods perform no better than random pruning. We hypothesize that this degradation is caused by \"vanishing token information\", where visual tokens progressively lose their salience with increasing network depth. To validate this hypothesis, we quantify a token's information content by measuring the change in the model output probabilities upon its removal. Using this proposed metric, our analysis of the information of visual tokens across layers reveals three key findings: (1) As layers deepen, the information of visual tokens gradually becomes uniform and eventually vanishes at an intermediate layer, which we term as \"information horizon\", beyond which the visual tokens become redundant; (2) The position of this horizon is not static; it extends deeper for visually intensive tasks, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), compared to more general tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA); (3) This horizon is also strongly correlated with model capacity, as stronger VLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL) employ deeper visual tokens than weaker models (e.g., LLaVA-1.5). Based on our findings, we show that simple random pruning in deep layers efficiently balances performance and efficiency. Moreover, integrating random pruning consistently enhances existing methods. Using DivPrune with random pruning achieves state-of-the-art results, maintaining 96.9% of Qwen-2.5-VL-7B performance while pruning 50% of visual tokens.

Recent advancements employ predefined object queries to aggregate semantic information from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) outputs that are lifted into 3D point clouds, facilitating spatial information propagation through inter-query interactions. Nevertheless, perception is an inherently dynamic process, rendering temporal understanding a critical yet overlooked dimension within these prevailing query-based pipelines. Therefore, to further unlock the temporal environmental perception capabilities of embodied agents, our work reconceptualizes online 3D segmentation as an instance tracking problem (AutoSeg3D). Our core strategy involves utilizing object queries for temporal information propagation, where long-term instance association promotes the coherence of features and object identities, while short-term instance update enriches instant observations. Given that viewpoint variations in embodied robotics often lead to partial object visibility across frames, this mechanism aids the model in developing a holistic object understanding beyond incomplete instantaneous views. Furthermore, we introduce spatial consistency learning to mitigate the fragmentation problem inherent in VFMs, yielding more comprehensive instance information for enhancing the efficacy of both long-term and short-term temporal learning. The temporal information exchange and consistency learning facilitated by these sparse object queries not only enhance spatial comprehension but also circumvent the computational burden associated with dense temporal point cloud interactions.

While most prior work has focused on selecting informative images for classification tasks, we investigate the more challenging setting of dense prediction, where annotations are more costly and time-intensive, especially in medical imaging. Region-level annotation has been shown to be more efficient than image-level annotation for these tasks. However, existing methods for representative annotation region selection suffer from high computational and memory costs, irrelevant region choices, and heavy reliance on uncertainty sampling. We propose decomposition sampling (DECOMP), a new active learning sampling strategy that addresses these limitations. It enhances annotation diversity by decomposing images into class-specific components using pseudo-labels and sampling regions from each class. Class-wise predictive confidence further guides the sampling process, ensuring that difficult classes receive additional annotations. Across ROI classification, 2-D segmentation, and 3-D segmentation, DECOMP consistently surpasses baseline methods by better sampling minority-class regions and boosting performance on these challenging classes.

A major barrier is data heterogeneity. This is particularly true in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, where scanner hardware differences, diverse acquisition protocols, and varying sequence parameters introduce substantial domain shifts that obscure underlying biological signals. Data harmonization methods aim to reduce these instrumental and acquisition variability, but existing approaches remain insufficient. When applied to imaging data, image-based harmonization approaches are often restricted by the need for target images, while existing text-guided methods rely on simplistic labels that fail to capture complex acquisition details or are typically restricted to datasets with limited variability, failing to capture the heterogeneity of real-world clinical environments. To address these limitations, we propose DIST-CLIP (Disentangled Style Transfer with CLIP Guidance), a unified framework for MRI harmonization that flexibly uses either target images or DICOM metadata for guidance. Our framework explicitly disentangles anatomical content from image contrast, with the contrast representations being extracted using pre-trained CLIP encoders. These contrast embeddings are then integrated into the anatomical content via a novel Adaptive Style Transfer module. We trained and evaluated DIST-CLIP on diverse real-world clinical datasets, and showed significant improvements in performance when compared against state-of-the-art methods in both style translation fidelity and anatomical preservation, offering a flexible solution for style transfer and standardizing MRI data.

Training or even finetuning such models demands vast datasets and computational resources, which are often scarce and costly. Adaptation methods provide a computationally efficient solution to address these limitations by allowing such models to be finetuned on small amounts of data and computing power. This is achieved by appending new trainable modules to frozen backbones with only a fraction of the trainable parameters and fitting only these modules on novel tasks. Recently, the VeRA adapter was shown to excel in parameter-efficient adaptations by utilizing a pair of frozen random low-rank matrices shared across all layers. In this paper, we propose PVeRA, a probabilistic version of the VeRA adapter, which modifies the low-rank matrices of VeRA in a probabilistic manner. This modification naturally allows handling inherent ambiguities in the input and allows for different sampling configurations during training and testing.

Current 3D avatar generation methods, which rely on large reconstruction models, are fast and capable of producing stable body structures, but they often suffer from artifacts such as blurry textures and stiff, unnatural motion. In contrast, generative video models show promising performance by synthesizing photorealistic and dynamic results, but they frequently struggle with unstable behavior, including body structural errors and identity drift. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework employs a 3D reconstruction model to provide robust structural and appearance priors, which in turn guides a real-time autoregressive video diffusion model for rendering. This process enables the model to synthesize high-frequency, photorealistic details and fluid dynamics in real time, effectively reducing texture blur and motion stiffness while preventing the structural inconsistencies common in video generation methods. By uniting the geometric stability of 3D reconstruction with the generative capabilities of video models, our method produces high-fidelity digital avatars with realistic appearance and dynamic, temporally coherent motion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces artifacts and achieves substantial improvements in visual quality over leading methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for real-time applications such as gaming and virtual reality.

Action information can be extracted from the body pose and movements, as well as from the background scene. However, the extent to which deep neural networks (DNNs) make use of information about the body and information about the background remains unclear. Since these two sources of information may be correlated within a training dataset, DNNs might learn to rely predominantly on one of them, without taking full advantage of the other. Unlike DNNs, humans have domain-specific brain regions selective for perceiving bodies, and regions selective for perceiving scenes. The present work tests whether humans are thus more effective at extracting information from both body and background, and whether building brain-inspired deep network architectures with separate domain-specific streams for body and scene perception endows them with more human-like performance. We first demonstrate that DNNs trained using the HAA500 dataset perform almost as accurately on versions of the stimuli that show both body and background and on versions of the stimuli from which the body was removed, but are at chance-level for versions of the stimuli from which the background was removed. Conversely, human participants (N=28) can recognize the same set of actions accurately with all three versions of the stimuli, and perform significantly better on stimuli that show only the body than on stimuli that show only the background. Finally, we implement and test a novel architecture patterned after domain specificity in the brain with separate streams to process body and background information. We show that 1) this architecture improves action recognition performance, and 2) its accuracy across different versions of the stimuli follows a pattern that matches more closely the pattern of accuracy observed in human participants."}

In this work, we propose DiffusionDriveV2, which leverages reinforcement learning to both constrain low-quality modes and explore for superior trajectories. This significantly enhances the overall output quality while preserving the inherent multimodality of its core Gaussian Mixture Model. First, we use scale-adaptive multiplicative noise, ideal for trajectory planning, to promote broad exploration.

By mining and attending to the visible-infrared modality bias, this paper focuses on addressing cross-modality learning from two aspects: bias-mitigated global association and modality-invariant representation learning. Motivated by the camera-aware distance rectification in single-modality re-ID, we propose modality-aware Jaccard distance to mitigate the distance bias caused by modality discrepancy, so that more reliable cross-modality associations can be estimated through global clustering. To further improve cross-modality representation learning, a `split-and-contrast' strategy is designed to obtain modality-specific global prototypes.

The primary obstacle to automating this process has been the lack of large-scale, \"in-the-wild\" video datasets suitable for training robust deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark with three novel datasets: Gorilla-SPAC-Wild, the largest video dataset for wild primate re-identification to date; Gorilla-Berlin-Zoo, for assessing cross-domain re-identification generalization; and Gorilla-SPAC-MoT, for evaluating multi-object tracking in camera trap footage. Building on these datasets, we present GorillaWatch, an end-to-end pipeline integrating detection, tracking, and re-identification. To exploit temporal information, we introduce a multi-frame self-supervised pretraining strategy that leverages consistency in tracklets to learn domain-specific features without manual labels. To ensure scientific validity, a differentiable adaptation of AttnLRP verifies that our model relies on discriminative biometric traits rather than background correlations. Extensive benchmarking subsequently demonstrates that aggregating features from large-scale image backbones outperforms specialized video architectures. Finally, we address unsupervised population counting by integrating spatiotemporal constraints into standard clustering to mitigate over-segmentation. We publicly release all code and datasets to facilitate scalable, non-invasive monitoring of endangered species"}

Yet, existing approaches such as VAEs and foundation model aligned encoders implicitly constrain the latent space without explicitly shaping its distribution, making it unclear which types of distributions are optimal for modeling. We introduce \\textbf{Distribution-Matching VAE} (\\textbf{DMVAE}), which explicitly aligns the encoder's latent distribution with an arbitrary reference distribution via a distribution matching constraint. This generalizes beyond the Gaussian prior of conventional VAEs, enabling alignment with distributions derived from self-supervised features, diffusion noise, or other prior distributions. With DMVAE, we can systematically investigate which latent distributions are more conducive to modeling, and we find that SSL-derived distributions provide an excellent balance between reconstruction fidelity and modeling efficiency, reaching gFID equals 3.2 on ImageNet with only 64 training epochs. Our results suggest that choosing a suitable latent distribution structure (achieved via distribution-level alignment), rather than relying on fixed priors, is key to bridging the gap between easy-to-model latents and high-fidelity image synthesis.

However, existing multi-shot video generation (MSV) methods struggle to effectively model long-range cross-shot context, as they rely on limited temporal windows or single keyframe conditioning, leading to degraded performance under complex narratives. In this work, we propose OneStory, enabling global yet compact cross-shot context modeling for consistent and scalable narrative generation. OneStory reformulates MSV as a next-shot generation task, enabling autoregressive shot synthesis while leveraging pretrained image-to-video (I2V) models for strong visual conditioning. We introduce two key modules: a Frame Selection module that constructs a semantically-relevant global memory based on informative frames from prior shots, and an Adaptive Conditioner that performs importance-guided patchification to generate compact context for direct conditioning. We further curate a high-quality multi-shot dataset with referential captions to mirror real-world storytelling patterns, and design effective training strategies under the next-shot paradigm. Finetuned from a pretrained I2V model on our curated 60K dataset, OneStory achieves state-of-the-art narrative coherence across diverse and complex scenes in both text- and image-conditioned settings, enabling controllable and immersive long-form video storytelling."}

This dual hierarchy achieves both computational efficiency and representational richness, enabling fast reconstruction of large and complex scenes.

Project webpage: https://tau-vailab.github.io/Lang3D-XL", "summary": "Embedding a language field in a 3D representation enables richer semantic understanding of spatial environments by linking geometry with descriptive meaning. This allows for a more intuitive human-computer interaction, enabling querying or editing scenes using natural language, and could potentially improve tasks like scene retrieval, navigation, and multimodal reasoning. While such capabilities could be transformative, in particular for large-scale scenes, we find that recent feature distillation approaches cannot effectively learn over massive Internet data due to challenges in semantic feature misalignment and inefficiency in memory and runtime. To this end, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges. First, we introduce extremely low-dimensional semantic bottleneck features as part of the underlying 3D Gaussian representation. These are processed by rendering and passing them through a multi-resolution, feature-based, hash encoder. This significantly improves efficiency both in runtime and GPU memory. Second, we introduce an Attenuated Downsampler module and propose several regularizations addressing the semantic misalignment of ground truth 2D features. We evaluate our method on the in-the-wild HolyScenes dataset and demonstrate that it surpasses existing approaches in both performance and efficiency."}

We present WorldReel, a 4D video generator that is natively spatio-temporally consistent. WorldReel jointly produces RGB frames together with 4D scene representations, including pointmaps, camera trajectory, and dense flow mapping, enabling coherent geometry and appearance modeling over time. Our explicit 4D representation enforces a single underlying scene that persists across viewpoints and dynamic content, yielding videos that remain consistent even under large non-rigid motion and significant camera movement. We train WorldReel by carefully combining synthetic and real data: synthetic data providing precise 4D supervision (geometry, motion, and camera), while real videos contribute visual diversity and realism. This blend allows WorldReel to generalize to in-the-wild footage while preserving strong geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WorldReel sets a new state-of-the-art for consistent video generation with dynamic scenes and moving cameras, improving metrics of geometric consistency, motion coherence, and reducing view-time artifacts over competing methods. We believe that WorldReel brings video generation closer to 4D-consistent world modeling, where agents can render, interact, and reason about scenes through a single and stable spatiotemporal representation."}

In parallel, there has been growing interest in leveraging high-quality pre-trained visual representations, either by aligning them inside VAEs or directly within the generative model. However, adapting such representations remains challenging due to fundamental mismatches between understanding-oriented features and generation-friendly latent spaces. Representation encoders benefit from high-dimensional latents that capture diverse hypotheses for masked regions, whereas generative models favor low-dimensional latents that must faithfully preserve injected noise. This discrepancy has led prior work to rely on complex objectives and architectures. In this work, we propose FAE (Feature Auto-Encoder), a simple yet effective framework that adapts pre-trained visual representations into low-dimensional latents suitable for generation using as little as a single attention layer, while retaining sufficient information for both reconstruction and understanding. The key is to couple two separate deep decoders: one trained to reconstruct the original feature space, and a second that takes the reconstructed features as input for image generation. FAE is generic; it can be instantiated with a variety of self-supervised encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP) and plugged into two distinct generative families: diffusion models and normalizing flows. Across class-conditional and text-to-image benchmarks, FAE achieves strong performance. For example, on ImageNet 256x256, our diffusion model with CFG attains a near state-of-the-art FID of 1.29 (800 epochs) and 1.70 (80 epochs). Without CFG, FAE reaches the state-of-the-art FID of 1.48 (800 epochs) and 2.08 (80 epochs), demonstrating both high quality and fast learning."}

An apple is like a peach because both are reddish fruit, but the Earth is also like a peach: its crust, mantle, and core correspond to the peach's skin, flesh, and pit. This ability to perceive and recognize relational similarity, is arguable by cognitive scientist to be what distinguishes humans from other species. Yet, all widely used visual similarity metrics today (e.g., LPIPS, CLIP, DINO) focus solely on perceptual attribute similarity and fail to capture the rich, often surprising relational similarities that humans perceive. How can we go beyond the visible content of an image to capture its relational properties? How can we bring images with the same relational logic closer together in representation space? To answer these questions, we first formulate relational image similarity as a measurable problem: two images are relationally similar when their internal relations or functions among visual elements correspond, even if their visual attributes differ. We then curate 114k image-caption dataset in which the captions are anonymized -- describing the underlying relational logic of the scene rather than its surface content. Using this dataset, we finetune a Vision-Language model to measure the relational similarity between images. This model serves as the first step toward connecting images by their underlying relational structure rather than their visible appearance. Our study shows that while relational similarity has a lot of real-world applications, existing image similarity models fail to capture it -- revealing a critical gap in visual computing."}

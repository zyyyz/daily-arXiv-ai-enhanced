For instance, a pasta dish might\nappear with various garnishes on different plates and in diverse lighting\nconditions and camera perspectives. This problem leads to losing focus on the\nmost important elements when comparing the query with support images, resulting\nin misclassification. To address this issue, we propose Stochastic-based Patch\nFiltering for Few-Shot Learning (SPFF) to attend to the patch embeddings that\nshow greater correlation with the class representation. The key concept of SPFF\ninvolves the stochastic filtering of patch embeddings, where patches less\nsimilar to the class-aware embedding are more likely to be discarded. With\npatch embedding filtered according to the probability of appearance, we use a\nsimilarity matrix that quantifies the relationship between the query image and\nits respective support images. Through a qualitative analysis, we demonstrate\nthat SPFF effectively focuses on patches where class-specific food features are\nmost prominent while successfully filtering out non-relevant patches. We\nvalidate our approach through extensive experiments on few-shot classification\nbenchmarks: Food-101, VireoFood-172 and UECFood-256, outperforming the existing\nSoA methods."}

In the third stage, we design an in-context\nlearning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image\nas the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we\ndesign a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level\nanomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in\nconjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To\nsupport our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across\n400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level\ntextual annotations.

While QINRs recently\nemerged as a promising new paradigm, many challenges concerning their\narchitecture and ansatz design, the utility of quantum-mechanical properties,\ntraining efficiency and the interplay with classical modules remain. This paper\nadvances the field by introducing a new type of QINR for 2D image and 3D\ngeometric field learning, which we collectively refer to as Quantum Visual\nField (QVF). QVF encodes classical data into quantum statevectors using neural\namplitude encoding grounded in a learnable energy manifold, ensuring meaningful\nHilbert space embeddings. Our ansatz follows a fully entangled design of\nlearnable parametrised quantum circuits, with quantum (unitary) operations\nperformed in the real Hilbert space, resulting in numerically stable training\nwith fast convergence. QVF does not rely on classical post-processing -- in\ncontrast to the previous QINR learning approach -- and directly employs\nprojective measurement to extract learned signals encoded in the ansatz.\nExperiments on a quantum hardware simulator demonstrate that QVF outperforms\nthe existing quantum approach and widely used classical foundational baselines\nin terms of visual representation accuracy across various metrics and model\ncharacteristics, such as learning of high-frequency details. We also show\napplications of QVF in 2D and 3D field completion and 3D shape interpolation,\nhighlighting its practical potential."}

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under
distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this
challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior
approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time
adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight
test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant
Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple
variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that
nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions
are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove
unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and
trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets
demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones,
highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both
high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos,
and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either
reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these
diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and
modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer
architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of
arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we
introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and
Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By
employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from
single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent
tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01
rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9%
classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both
visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete
tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding
tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all
benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI
systems built upon unified visual tokenization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering results
while addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views.
At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticity
to quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability to
consolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspired
by the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism in
neuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering
method (MemEvo) to achieve this balance. First, we propose a
hippocampus-inspired view alignment module that captures the gain information
of new views by aligning structures in continuous representations. Second, we
introduce a cognitive forgetting mechanism that simulates the decay patterns of
human memory to modulate the weights of historical knowledge. Additionally, we
design a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module that
leverages temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate historical
knowledge. By integrating these modules, MemEvo achieves strong knowledge
retention capabilities in scenarios with a growing number of views. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MemEvo exhibits remarkable advantages over
existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [4] [Edge-Aware Normalized Attention for Efficient and Detail-Preserving Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14550)

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains highly ill-posed because
recovering structurally faithful high-frequency content from a single
low-resolution observation is ambiguous. Existing edge-aware methods often
attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones,
yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or
limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention
mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge
features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and
reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while
suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a
lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining
pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual
realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR
benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and
perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at
comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a
parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial
refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity
without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These
results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation
for advancing perceptual super-resolution.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the
scanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent
state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point
locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising
process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear
how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with
different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion
model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and
determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then
invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the
adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process,
we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the
network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative
denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our
approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the
shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other
methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the
synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the
real-scanned dataset.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing
methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide
high-precision localization references, their costly construction and
maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward
standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based
approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and
maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily
available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose
DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS
denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS
trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly
encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative
diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g.,
OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse
GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals,
achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that
diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a
generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based
methods.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction is fundamentally
challenging due to undersampling, leading to an ill-posed inverse problem.
Traditional iterative methods incorporate handcrafted or learned priors to
regularize the solution but struggle to capture the complex structures present
in medical images. In contrast, diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as
powerful generative priors that can accurately model complex image
distributions. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium
(DICE), a framework that integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the
sampling process of a DM. DICE alternates between: (i) a data-consistency
agent, implemented through a proximal operator enforcing measurement
consistency, and (ii) a prior agent, realized by a DM performing a clean image
estimation at each sampling step. By balancing these two complementary agents
iteratively, DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities
with measurement consistency. Experimental results show that DICE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images
under uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out
of a total of 180), demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The development of methods to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis
(UC) is of significant importance. However, these methods often suffer from
domain shifts caused by differences in imaging devices and clinical settings
across hospitals. Although several domain adaptation methods have been proposed
to address domain shift, they still struggle with the lack of supervision in
the target domain or the high cost of annotation. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method that leverages
patient-level diagnostic results, which are routinely recorded in UC diagnosis,
as weak supervision in the target domain. The proposed method aligns class-wise
distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity
Triplet Loss, which leverages the characteristic that patient-level diagnoses
are determined by the most severe region within each patient. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative DA approaches,
improving UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

Abstract: Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We
introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban
perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs
and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community
groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical
attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to
English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt
and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard
overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and
pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible,
objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet)
reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human
agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower
scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible,
uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive
reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely
depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular
structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task
highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation,
whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully
exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud
compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal
alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using
aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding
framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that
enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby
supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding
efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly
improving compression efficiency and processing performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In the domain of 3D biomedical image segmentation, Mamba exhibits the
superior performance for it addresses the limitations in modeling long-range
dependencies inherent to CNNs and mitigates the abundant computational overhead
associated with Transformer-based frameworks when processing high-resolution
medical volumes. However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling
may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus
leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs.
Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual
complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively
integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to
harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a
gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual
modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer.
Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image
segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and
low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections
exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature
constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of
feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is
transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The
intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale
feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global
contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer
connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two
complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module
addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden
representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature
refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the
intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on
global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature
integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly
incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across
CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like
networks.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the
scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and
long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified
framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data
diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC)
module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches
are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to
preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal
convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an
Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and
restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution
shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves
state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4%
and 92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set),97.2% on NW-UCLA. Code:

Abstract: Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with
challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing

noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model
capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality
image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a
diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer
operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex
semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We
employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions
and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our
MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated
editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively
preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe
MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse
and challenging IBIE capabilities. Our dataset is available at

Abstract: In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in
visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose;
however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation
generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating
explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance
interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention
Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism
simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus
enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA
mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively
addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our
method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results
showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean
intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and
insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets.
Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the

address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages
foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our
method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with
high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature
extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex
Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this
constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images,
achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos
remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view
observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise,
they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of
3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and
information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that
integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian
Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh
faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior
surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage
foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to
complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when
distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting
optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct
parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training
strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to
optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination
of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our
approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared
to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance
fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled
prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and
temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

Abstract: Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer
vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ
them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking
process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain
underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.
Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly
participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in
an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with
users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method
supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable
decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To
enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query
deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple
semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR),
composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our
code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .

Abstract: Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem.
Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their

accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several
diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating
synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our
findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion
models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy,
particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to
obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with
relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for
further enhancements.

data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different

the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video
VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored

Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely
applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot
collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are
computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time
methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of
freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this
problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface
detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is
first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat
clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be
easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.
Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary
description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public
datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the
state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.
Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian
mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring
large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model
complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data
efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field
of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training
datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative
adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR
was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the
current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific
information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these
issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does
not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract
high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then
fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution
and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less
training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we
train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original
dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model
fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much
shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

Abstract: Text to image latent diffusion models have recently advanced medical image
synthesis, but applications to 3D CT generation remain limited. Existing
approaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in
full radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical
fidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion
framework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text
radiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using
multiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text
encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced
clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a
3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset.
Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real
synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic
alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against
GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with
excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning
improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical
details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further
enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the
VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved
state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging
complete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT
advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality
synthetic data.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually
limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle
the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we
propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for
bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly
to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic
knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the
intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges
without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces
mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can
be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size
to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and
fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and
improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned
problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a
broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides
insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

Abstract: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions
through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However,
ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy

regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used
Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and
demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training
consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and
topological correctness.

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection
and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a
diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The
applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods
rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and
focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and
left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a
multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient
records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design,
which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the
upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions,
including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be
visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients,
the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8%
in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

Abstract: To maintain an overview of urban conditions, city administrations manage

digitization increases, so does the need for more data and up-to-date
databases, requiring significant manual effort. This paper introduces
MapAnything, a module that automatically determines the geocoordinates of
objects using individual images. Utilizing advanced Metric Depth Estimation
models, MapAnything calculates geocoordinates based on the object's distance
from the camera, geometric principles, and camera specifications. We detail and
validate the module, providing recommendations for automating urban object and
incident mapping. Our evaluation measures the accuracy of estimated distances
against LiDAR point clouds in urban environments, analyzing performance across
distance intervals and semantic areas like roads and vegetation. The module's
effectiveness is demonstrated through practical use cases involving traffic
signs and road damage.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization
capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are
expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting
degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature
Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit
degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have
assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG),
while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models
predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct
degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we
propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and
denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be
seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring
architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance
compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional
benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack.
This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model
training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to
achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs)
alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on
single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of
visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for
Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image
classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an
Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted
prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained
descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent
synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,
producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly
decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective
synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training
and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and
interpretable image classification.

Abstract: The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to

generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete
control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive
attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse
denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with
those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized
anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left
unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while
requiring no additional model training. The source code is available on our

Abstract: Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual
response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and
response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to
learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging
data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent
space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task
model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the
comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the
publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory
space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0),
0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points
(T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e.,

data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their
adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their
decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues
on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based
image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation
network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited
by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our
method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional
insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision
and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

Track based on the SAM2 framework. We adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy during
training: a trained SAM2 checkpoint is deployed within the SAM2Long framework
to generate pseudo labels for the MOSE test set, which are then combined with
existing data for further training. For inference, the SAM2Long framework is
employed to obtain our primary segmentation results, while an open-source SeC
model runs in parallel to produce complementary predictions. A cascaded
decision mechanism dynamically integrates outputs from both models, exploiting
the temporal stability of SAM2Long and the concept-level robustness of SeC.
Benefiting from pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference, our
approach achieves a J\&F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set -- +1.4 points
over our SAM2Long baseline -- securing the 2nd place in the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track, and demonstrating strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video

Abstract: Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and
few-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when
fine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR),
morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these
models may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their
foundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we
systematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP
fine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the
original CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and
linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our
results indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization,
especially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed
out that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs.
binary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The
FRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the
large-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.
However, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching
only 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover,
the larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's
original generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that
increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.

Abstract: The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition
systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental
learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric
misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with
2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by
texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural
cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To
address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a
framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical
spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric
Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's
intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion.
Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet
discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal
consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a
Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot
class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and
robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive
window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex
functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit
a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due
to inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent
these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical
performance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric
deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the
intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network
hierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs
a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to
distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning
robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr\'echet mean for
graph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric
disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
a wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines. This work pioneers a new
geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, highlighting the immense
potential of hyperbolic GNNs in the field of computational psychiatry.

Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce
makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses
substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and
a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with
diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large
viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and
reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely
on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification
framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D
reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the
first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for
generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then
estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,
preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When
invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a
3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a
keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences
between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity
scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior
state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,
avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code

Abstract: Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on

spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic
object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a
dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive
Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates
structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric
relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic
masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful
parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams
are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing
from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play
components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant
frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across
different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,
and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation
scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline
rotation-invariant methods.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer

multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a
vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The
model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning
seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple
tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual
question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM
achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and
ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report
generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential
to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a
viable technical solution for future clinical applications. Source code and

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for
applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D
modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in
generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often
face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency,
and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality
dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a
comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes
with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this
dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model
that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a
3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model
synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and
semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while
preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently
generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are
open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the
field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail
settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different
brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be
taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored
catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to
distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching
methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur
prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid
method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging
the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching
approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval
accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP)
is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products
from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a
segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3)
fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the
filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination
between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual
cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset
show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval
methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of
real-time processing for practical retail deployments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation
and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability
to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in
clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and
generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete
inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this,
we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for
missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of
three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module
explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and
modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The
Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge
from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial
feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior
probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task,
effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive
experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM
consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation
accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality
configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six
categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of
knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and
future research. Our source code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image
editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in
hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these
methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent
hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification,
\textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge
hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's
hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion
denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework,
which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts
hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a
reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy
optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations.
Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational
overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical
deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

Abstract: This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection,
focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can)
using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology
involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition,
and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high,
they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently,
models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of
predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to
guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle
competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity,
specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined
with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain
gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded
and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's
hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only
training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully

chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of
3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected
based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung
segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning
models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using
quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient,
Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical
acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and
MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories
(p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to
moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05),
without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231
provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models
with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined
significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized
model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

Abstract: Recent research on representation learning has proved the merits of

unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework,
termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we
assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt,
which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient
pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different
modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a
universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the
model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios, regardless of the
arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor
achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic
segmentation datasets, including NYU Depthv2, EventScape, MFNet, DeLiVER,
SUNRGBD, and KITTI-360.

Abstract: Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter
optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and
reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes.
Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as
supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera
poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually
captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate
and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised
by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1)
Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse
hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint
Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive
down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A
Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by
a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We
visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate
accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and
assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform
experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics)
and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates
camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as
the only supervision.

self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks,
MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over
previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of

Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in

inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions
well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification
training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric
geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies
that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification
objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i)
incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically
improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving
intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive
biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered
unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity
of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a
novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new
directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy
and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within
the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have
exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,
which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.
This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional
prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their
implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG
behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that
exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly
altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the
instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface
components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted
to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,
to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across
diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that
simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the
discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.
Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to
evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and
stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR
while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and
previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to
reassess the shared instructional prompts.

focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical
images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle
this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills
knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from
scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models
using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning
rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and
unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction
accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate
pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets
demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different
settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,
allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its
adaptability as more advanced models emerge. The code is available at

Abstract: The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the

likeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN,
consisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially
unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship
verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child
images. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an
average of 13.14\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by
9.1\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects'
identities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups.
Additionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the
KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the
verification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our
RA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter,
mother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41,
respectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal
tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we
utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot
solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to
dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens},
for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal
grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query
(\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we
propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel
decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented
assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH
strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action
sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and
temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to
learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token
predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action
cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and
temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the
attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS
strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the
temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We
evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods
on three common STVG benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture, yet
curated datasets remain scarce. We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image
dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season
crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting
determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as
replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and
error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD
contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse
growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,
and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows
detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among
tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for
single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall
up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity
and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further
reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11
maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for
saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that
enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time
decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural
monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.

In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms

identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual
semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency,
and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively
addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to
a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models
(ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR
significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models
and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings
approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for
LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

networks are end-to-end trained to minimize the error between the predicted and
ground-truth parameters of the transformation, combined with a discriminator to
maintain high perceptual quality. We experimentally validate our method on a
wide variety of geometric and valuemetric transformations, demonstrating its
effectiveness in accurately synchronizing images. We further show that our
synchronization can effectively upgrade existing watermarking methods to
withstand geometric transformations to which they were previously vulnerable.

Abstract: This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built
upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We
propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric
Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric
manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame
and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware
Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories,
thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction.
Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a
variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact
latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When
finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the
proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA
models.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous
systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and
virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free
observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight
objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera
coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised
trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable
prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present
advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the
noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.
Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight
Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending
its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual
reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera
calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of
visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an
unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB
datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory
denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.
Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such
as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,
providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative
to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor
trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances. The
code and preprocessed datasets are available at github.com/Hai-chao-Zhang/OST

Abstract: To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based
multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation
and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the
computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then
gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve
great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion
models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In
this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models
in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion
process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we
design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve
efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net
and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling
strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence
estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two
novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory.
CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and
ETH3D. Code is available at: https://github.com/cvg/diffmvs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled computer use agents (CUAs) that
operate GUIs autonomously, showing great potential, yet progress is limited by
the lack of large-scale, open-source computer use data and foundation models.
In this work, we introduce ScaleCUA, a step toward scaling open-source CUAs. It
offers a large-scale dataset spanning 6 operating systems and 3 task domains,
built via a closed-loop pipeline uniting automated agents with human experts.
Trained on this scaled-up data, ScaleCUA can operate seamlessly across
platforms. Specifically, it delivers strong gains over baselines (+26.6 on
WebArena-Lite-v2, +10.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro) and sets new state-of-the-art
results (94.4% on MMBench-GUI L1-Hard, 60.6% on OSWorld-G, 47.4% on
WebArena-Lite-v2). These findings underscore the power of data-driven scaling
for general-purpose computer use agents. We will release data, models, and code
to advance future research: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ScaleCUA.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information,
making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed
motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large
datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based
monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we
propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels
leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event
stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available
off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally,
we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2),
or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from
monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world
datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive
performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive
depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: We introduce VocAlign, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework
specifically designed for VLMs in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Our
method adopts a student-teacher paradigm enhanced with a vocabulary alignment
strategy, which improves pseudo-label generation by incorporating additional
class concepts. To ensure efficiency, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
fine-tune the model, preserving its original capabilities while minimizing
computational overhead. In addition, we propose a Top-K class selection
mechanism for the student model, which significantly reduces memory
requirements while further improving adaptation performance. Our approach
achieves a notable 6.11 mIoU improvement on the CityScapes dataset and
demonstrates superior performance on zero-shot segmentation benchmarks, setting
a new standard for source-free adaptation in the open-vocabulary setting.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale
image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely
unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated
predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and
decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the
first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt
optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration
objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that
attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences.
Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature
proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of
multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs
and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently
improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy. Our code is
available at https://github.com/iabh1shekbasu/CalibPrompt.

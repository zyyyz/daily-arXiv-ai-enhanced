While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for\nnatural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral\ndomain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an\nattempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene\nunderstanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework.

This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake\nscenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader\nAI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such\ncontent becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the\nintegrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a\nphysically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that\ndefocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a\ndepth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured\nimages due to lens focus and scene geometry.

While post-training quantization (PTQ) has\nsuccessfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without\nsignificant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)\nremains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on\nultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals\nthat multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them\nexhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text\ntokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the\nactivation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over\ndifferent layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation\ndistributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better\ntolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a\nnovel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit\nQuantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers\nthat are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of\nmultimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the\nultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL\nacross 9 popular VQA benchmarks.

The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and\ntheir corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation\nmaps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.\nTheir contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image\nclassification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying\nthe concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to\nhandle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset.

However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object\ndetection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on\nthese tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.\nUnderstanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to\nassessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of\nCLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic\nsegmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples\ngenerated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic\nsegmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from\ncoarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP\nmodel. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task\nAdversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature\naggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task\ngeneralization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of\nfine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on\nmultiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the\nadversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across\nmultiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,\nwithout increasing the perturbation budget.

We address these issues by proposing\nConfidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven\nframework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment\nin complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence\nreliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap\nconfidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric\nsimilarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The\ncontext-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global\nattention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving\nrobustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value\ndecomposition solver to compute precise transformations.

Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim\nmodel to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or\nreplaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are\nrelatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such\nfrequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on\nthese targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce\nTokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the\ncompositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed\ntargeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object\nrelationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate\noutputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their\nrelationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap\ninjects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the\ngrammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,\nthe poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,\nmaking it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address\nthis, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly\nemphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and\nbags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nTokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior\nevasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM\narchitectures."}

Based on this\nprinciple, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:\n(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial\nchannels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature\ninteraction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which\nlearns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and\nsuppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models\nlong-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong\nefficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG\nsolution."}

Our study\nreveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental\nbarriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that\ndegrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we\nintroduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that\nscales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output\nenhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show\nthat these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with\nCOLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense\nCOLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of\nremaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the\nfuture development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS.

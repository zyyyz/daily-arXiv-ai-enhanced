Specifically, to\nsupport interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary\nPosition Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to\nalign generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables\nfine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of\nfixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we\ndecompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We\nfurther design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it\nleverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and\ntemporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless\nspatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build\ncomprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to\nassess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show\nthat ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher\nfidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity.

However, such\napproaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of\nparallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like\nMamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state\ntransitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while\nmaintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,\nMamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its\ncausal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we\npropose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for\nspatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient\ntemporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an\nalignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame\nwithin the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back\nafterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective\nredistribution of aggregated information across all frames.

We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware\nDawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label\nunderstanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,\ncontext-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,\nconverts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio\nthat is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated\nvia Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable\nposteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve\nuniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise\ngeneral VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured\nannotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an\nautomatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11\n+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three\nheterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming\ndistance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the\nproposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement\nin Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best\nsingle model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust\ndecision-support component for AV pipelines."}

Intuitively, such\nrequirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable\nenvironment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,\ncode). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for\ngenerating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework\ncomprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture\ncontent into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual\nassets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable\nPython codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;\nand (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual\nanchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support\nsystematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,\ndiscipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse\ndimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and\nparticularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a\nVLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.\nOur results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,\ninterpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct\ncode generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials.

Inspired by this mental process,\nwe present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with\nevolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.\nGiven a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video\nframes by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then\nevolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play\ntransformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric\nreprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior\nstate-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in\nexploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the\nvideo generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target\nviewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual\nrealism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration\ncapabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic\noutdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world\nscenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial\ncoherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains\nspatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a\nsignificant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling."}

We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and\nprecise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and\na prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'\nunderstanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and\nmask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the\nobtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video\ngeneration model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization\ncapability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning\nand overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,\nthereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More\nimportantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation\nmodel, significantly improving overall performance.

However, current training pipelines primarily\nrely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured\nalignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome\nthis challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied\nagents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is\nSGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating\nscene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic\nlearning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from\nvideo-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for\nhuman-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both\nprompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph\ngeneration and action localization benchmarks.

However, current training\nmethods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to\nfully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are\noften trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic\nscaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models\nsuffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and\ntemporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal\ninflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a\nmodel's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos.\nTherefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves\nthe inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying\ntemporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates\nmodel weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM,\nwhich we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to\nseamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long,\ncomplex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of\nflexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On\nshort-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks,\nStretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%,\nwith strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore,\nour method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more\nrobust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition\nscenarios."}

The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning\n(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the\nsignificant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder\nas well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of\ntraining strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in\nstrongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a\ncritical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through\ndiverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and\nsegmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's\npost-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on\nMLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual\nrepresentations.

At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance\nmechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with\ndetailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously\nmatched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large\nvision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references\nof the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure.\nExperiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned\nresults.

Satellite-based attribution is challenging due\nto limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform\nbefore detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using\nground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high\nspatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually\ndistinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS)\ndataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed\nusing ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft\nsurveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple\ngeometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal\nsmoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This\nwork establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future\nresearch in linking contrails to their source flight."}

Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing\noutputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from\ncorners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a\nlightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as\nlabels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing\nhighly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded\nconditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset\ndemonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,\nrepeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of\n0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003\n(correct matches)."}

Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a\nframework that renders long texts into images and processes them with\nvision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual\ninput while preserving semantic information, and we further design an\nLLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations\nfor balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining\naccuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context\nbenchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and\ndecoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme\ncompression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text\ntasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal\ntasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at\nhttps://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph."}

However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong\nediting strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation\nbecomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual\nerrors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global\nconsistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as\ntexture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.\nRecently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant\nimprovements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for\nintegrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for\novercoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an\nin-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention\nmechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention\ncontrol method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates\nvision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and\ndifferentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce\nconsistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image\nand video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and\nstructure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first\napproach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers\nwithout handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which\nenables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports\nprogressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control."}

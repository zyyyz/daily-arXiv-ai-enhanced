However, these properties are not fully captured by\ndata augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on\ntransformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a\ntraining methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire\ninput space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training\nset to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which\nwe refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce\nfunctional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the\ntraining dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised\nmanner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled\nvirtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across\ndatasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently\noutperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On\npopular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%\ntop-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data\naugmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray\ndataset."}

We\nintroduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward\nlooking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and\n734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert\nannotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming\ninstrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video\nlanguage model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal\nCross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,\nwhile an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the\ntoken level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone\nto the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and\nEndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations\nshow that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame\nbudget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32\nframes slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a\ntemporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA\nadvances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.\nPitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and\nhighlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future\naware surgical assistance."}

We introduce Anny, a simple, fully\ndifferentiable, and scan-free human body model grounded in anthropometric\nknowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous,\ninterpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age,\nheight, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms --\nacross ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated\nusing WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically\ngrounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its\nopenness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D\nhuman modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled\nsynthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce\nAnny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny,\nshowing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the\nperformance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining\ninterpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are\nreleased under the Apache 2.0 license, making Anny an accessible foundation for\nhuman-centric 3D modeling."}

Rao"], "title": "Signal Intensity-weighted coordinate channels improve learning stability and generalisation in 1D and 2D CNNs in localisation tasks on biomedical signals", "comment": null, "summary": "Localisation tasks in biomedical data often require models to learn\nmeaningful spatial or temporal relationships from signals with complex\nintensity distributions. A common strategy, exemplified by CoordConv layers, is\nto append coordinate channels to convolutional inputs, enabling networks to\nlearn absolute positions. In this work, we propose a signal intensity-weighted\ncoordinate representation that replaces the pure coordinate channels with\nchannels scaled by local signal intensity. This modification embeds an\nintensity-position coupling directly in the input representation, introducing a\nsimple and modality-agnostic inductive bias. We evaluate the approach on two\ndistinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological\ntransition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the\ncoordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.\nIn both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher\ngeneralisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel\napproaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and\ntwo-dimensional biomedical signals."}

Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as\nconventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In\ncontrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an\ninherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network\neffectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a\ncompact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and\nenhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data\naugmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a\ncomposite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy\nof 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,\nand MC3_18 by up to 3%.

However, existing methods for social\ninteraction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic\nrepresentations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups\nwithout explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.\nThese drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and\nintroduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social\ninteractions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware\nbottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction\ndetection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions\nusing body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first\ndetects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then\ninfers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based\nreasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social\ncues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.\nExperiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior\nmethods, achieving the new state of the art."}

Project page:\n  https://jong980812.github.io/DANCE/", "summary": "Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle\nhow movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,\nexisting methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it\nunclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based\napproaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit\nnature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based\nExplainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions\nthrough disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We\ndefine motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large\nlanguage model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an\nante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these\nconcepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101\n-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with\ncompetitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE\nthrough a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial\nfor model debugging, editing, and failure analysis."}

Consequently, a model\nequipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of\napplications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension,\nanswering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos,\ncaption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and\nhigh-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we\nreview representative works across the key areas of research on modern\ngeneral-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance\nof grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary\nparadigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical\napplications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded\nmultimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among\nvisual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally,\nwe analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising\ndirections for future research."}

However, such\nmethods are susceptible to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a\nnovel attack that targets the visual component of editing methods. We introduce\nAttention Attack, which disrupts the cross-attention between a textual prompt\nand the visual representation of the image by using an automatically generated\ncaption of the source image as a proxy for the edit prompt. This breaks the\nalignment between the contents of the image and their textual description,\nwithout requiring knowledge of the editing method or the editing prompt.\nReflecting on the reliability of existing metrics for immunization success, we\npropose two novel evaluation strategies: Caption Similarity, which quantifies\nsemantic consistency between original and adversarial edits, and semantic\nIntersection over Union (IoU), which measures spatial layout disruption via\nsegmentation masks. Experiments conducted on the TEDBench++ benchmark\ndemonstrate that our attack significantly degrades editing performance while\nremaining imperceptible."}

With advances in deep learning, neural network-based\ncompression methods have emerged. In this process, an encoder maps the image to\na low-dimensional latent space, which is then quantized, entropy-coded into a\nbinary bitstream, and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver end, the\nbitstream is entropy-decoded, and a decoder reconstructs an approximation of\nthe original image. Recent research suggests that these models consistently\noutperform conventional codecs. However, they require significant processing\npower, making them unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained\nplatforms, which hinders their deployment in mainstream applications. This\nstudy aims to reduce the resource requirements of neural networks used for\nimage compression by leveraging knowledge distillation, a training paradigm\nwhere smaller neural networks, partially trained on the outputs of larger, more\ncomplex models, can achieve better performance than when trained independently.\nOur work demonstrates that knowledge distillation can be effectively applied to\nimage compression tasks: i) across various architecture sizes, ii) to achieve\ndifferent image quality/bit rate tradeoffs, and iii) to save processing and\nenergy resources. This approach introduces new settings and hyperparameters,\nand future research could explore the impact of different teacher models, as\nwell as alternative loss functions. Knowledge distillation could also be\nextended to transformer-based models. The code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/FABallemand/PRIM ."}

Recent methods rely on synthetic data\nor sparse annotations for limited indoor and even fewer outdoor scenes. We\nintroduce a novel training-free approach for intrinsic image decomposition\nusing only a pair of visible and thermal images. We leverage the principle that\nlight not reflected from an opaque surface is absorbed and detected as heat by\na thermal camera. This allows us to relate the ordinalities between visible and\nthermal image intensities to the ordinalities of shading and reflectance, which\ncan densely self-supervise an optimizing neural network to recover shading and\nreflectance. We perform quantitative evaluations with known reflectance and\nshading under natural and artificial lighting, and qualitative experiments\nacross diverse outdoor scenes. The results demonstrate superior performance\nover recent learning-based models and point toward a scalable path to curating\nreal-world ordinal supervision, previously infeasible via manual labeling."}

Nevertheless, current approaches remain\nvulnerable to challenging conditions such as poor lighting, occlusions, and\nadverse weather. To address these limitations, multimodal methods that\nintegrate auxiliary sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, infrared) have recently emerged,\nproviding complementary information that enhances robustness. In this work, we\npresent MM SAM-adapter, a novel framework that extends the capabilities of the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM) for multimodal semantic segmentation. The proposed\nmethod employs an adapter network that injects fused multimodal features into\nSAM's rich RGB features. This design enables the model to retain the strong\ngeneralization ability of RGB features while selectively incorporating\nauxiliary modalities only when they contribute additional cues. As a result, MM\nSAM-adapter achieves a balanced and efficient use of multimodal information. We\nevaluate our approach on three challenging benchmarks, DeLiVER, FMB, and MUSES,\nwhere MM SAM-adapter delivers state-of-the-art performance. To further analyze\nmodality contributions, we partition DeLiVER and FMB into RGB-easy and RGB-hard\nsubsets. Results consistently demonstrate that our framework outperforms\ncompeting methods in both favorable and adverse conditions, highlighting the\neffectiveness of multimodal adaptation for robust scene understanding.

Thus, we present the\n\\textbf{InfGen}, replacing the VAE decoder with the new generator, for\ngenerating images at any resolution from a fixed-size latent without retraining\nthe diffusion models, which simplifies the process, reducing computational\ncomplexity and can be applied to any model using the same latent space.\nExperiments show InfGen is capable of improving many models into the arbitrary\nhigh-resolution era while cutting 4K image generation time to under 10 seconds."}

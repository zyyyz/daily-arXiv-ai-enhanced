Abstract: A deep learning real-time smoking detection system for CCTV surveillance of
fire exit areas is proposed due to critical safety requirements. The dataset
contains 8,124 images from 20 different scenarios along with 2,708 raw samples
demonstrating low-light areas. We evaluated three advanced object detection
models: YOLOv8, YOLOv11, and YOLOv12, followed by development of a custom model
derived from YOLOv8 with added structures for challenging surveillance
contexts. The proposed model outperformed the others, achieving a recall of
78.90 percent and mAP at 50 of 83.70 percent, delivering optimal object
detection across varied environments. Performance evaluation on multiple edge
devices using multithreaded operations showed the Jetson Xavier NX processed
data at 52 to 97 milliseconds per inference, establishing its suitability for
time-sensitive operations. This system offers a robust and adaptable platform
for monitoring public safety and enabling automatic regulatory compliance.

Abstract: We train representation models with procedural data only, and apply them on
visual similarity, classification, and semantic segmentation tasks without
further training by using visual memory -- an explicit database of reference
image embeddings. Unlike prior work on visual memory, our approach achieves
full compartmentalization with respect to all real-world images while retaining
strong performance. Compared to a model trained on Places, our procedural model
performs within $1\%$ on NIGHTS visual similarity, outperforms by $8\%$ and
$15\%$ on CUB200 and Flowers102 fine-grained classification, and is within
$10\%$ on ImageNet-1K classification. It also demonstrates strong zero-shot
segmentation, achieving an $R^2$ on COCO within $10\%$ of the models trained on
real data. Finally, we analyze procedural versus real data models, showing that
parts of the same object have dissimilar representations in procedural models,
resulting in incorrect searches in memory and explaining the remaining
performance gap.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have shown great promise in medical image analysis by
improving generalization across diverse downstream tasks. In ophthalmology,
several FMs have recently emerged, but there is still no clear answer to
fundamental questions: Which FM performs the best? Are they equally good across
different tasks? What if we combine all FMs together? To our knowledge, this is
the first study to systematically evaluate both single and fused ophthalmic
FMs. To address these questions, we propose FusionFM, a comprehensive
evaluation suite, along with two fusion approaches to integrate different
ophthalmic FMs. Our framework covers both ophthalmic disease detection
(glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration) and
systemic disease prediction (diabetes and hypertension) based on retinal
imaging. We benchmarked four state-of-the-art FMs (RETFound, VisionFM,
RetiZero, and DINORET) using standardized datasets from multiple countries and
evaluated their performance using AUC and F1 metrics. Our results show that
DINORET and RetiZero achieve superior performance in both ophthalmic and
systemic disease tasks, with RetiZero exhibiting stronger generalization on
external datasets. Regarding fusion strategies, the Gating-based approach
provides modest improvements in predicting glaucoma, AMD, and hypertension.
Despite these advances, predicting systemic diseases, especially hypertension
in external cohort remains challenging. These findings provide an
evidence-based evaluation of ophthalmic FMs, highlight the benefits of model
fusion, and point to strategies for enhancing their clinical applicability.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Dentocraniofacial hard tissue defects profoundly affect patients'
physiological functions, facial aesthetics, and psychological well-being,
posing significant challenges for precise reconstruction. Current deep learning
models are limited to single-tissue scenarios and modality-specific imaging
inputs, resulting in poor generalizability and trade-offs between anatomical
fidelity, computational efficiency, and cross-tissue adaptability. Here we
introduce UniDCF, a unified framework capable of reconstructing multiple
dentocraniofacial hard tissues through multimodal fusion encoding of point
clouds and multi-view images. By leveraging the complementary strengths of each
modality and incorporating a score-based denoising module to refine surface
smoothness, UniDCF overcomes the limitations of prior single-modality
approaches. We curated the largest multimodal dataset, comprising intraoral
scans, CBCT, and CT from 6,609 patients, resulting in 54,555 annotated
instances. Evaluations demonstrate that UniDCF outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric precision, structural
completeness, and spatial accuracy. Clinical simulations indicate UniDCF
reduces reconstruction design time by 99% and achieves clinician-rated
acceptability exceeding 94%. Overall, UniDCF enables rapid, automated, and
high-fidelity reconstruction, supporting personalized and precise restorative
treatments, streamlining clinical workflows, and enhancing patient outcomes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present Ovis2.5, a successor to Ovis2 designed for native-resolution
visual perception and strong multimodal reasoning. Ovis2.5 integrates a
native-resolution vision transformer that processes images at their native,
variable resolutions, avoiding the degradation from fixed-resolution tiling and
preserving both fine detail and global layout -- crucial for visually dense
content like complex charts. To strengthen reasoning, we train the model to
move beyond linear chain-of-thought and perform reflection -- including
self-checking and revision. This advanced capability is exposed as an optional
"thinking mode" at inference time, allowing users to trade latency for enhanced
accuracy on difficult inputs. The model is trained via a comprehensive
five-phase curriculum that progressively builds its skills. The process begins
with foundational visual and multimodal pretraining, advances through
large-scale instruction tuning, and culminates in alignment and reasoning
enhancement using DPO and GRPO. To scale these upgrades efficiently, we employ
multimodal data packing and hybrid parallelism, yielding a significant
end-to-end speedup. We release two open-source models: Ovis2.5-9B and
Ovis2.5-2B. The latter continues the "small model, big performance" philosophy
of Ovis2, making it ideal for resource-constrained, on-device scenarios. On the
OpenCompass multimodal leaderboard, Ovis2.5-9B averages 78.3, marking a
substantial improvement over its predecessor, Ovis2-8B, and achieving
state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs in the sub-40B parameter
range; Ovis2.5-2B scores 73.9, establishing SOTA for its size. Beyond aggregate
scores, Ovis2.5 achieves leading results on STEM benchmarks, exhibits strong
capabilities on grounding and video tasks, and achieves open-source SOTA at its
scale for complex chart analysis.

Abstract: Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is important for structuring product
information in e-commerce. However, existing AVE datasets are primarily limited
to text-to-text or image-to-text settings, lacking support for product videos,
diverse attribute coverage, and public availability. To address these gaps, we
introduce VideoAVE, the first publicly available video-to-text e-commerce AVE
dataset across 14 different domains and covering 172 unique attributes. To
ensure data quality, we propose a post-hoc CLIP-based Mixture of Experts
filtering system (CLIP-MoE) to remove the mismatched video-product pairs,
resulting in a refined dataset of 224k training data and 25k evaluation data.
In order to evaluate the usability of the dataset, we further establish a
comprehensive benchmark by evaluating several state-of-the-art video vision
language models (VLMs) under both attribute-conditioned value prediction and
open attribute-value pair extraction tasks. Our results analysis reveals that
video-to-text AVE remains a challenging problem, particularly in open settings,
and there is still room for developing more advanced VLMs capable of leveraging
effective temporal information. The dataset and benchmark code for VideoAVE are
available at: https://github.com/gjiaying/VideoAVE

Abstract: This study investigates whether second-order geometric cues - planar
curvature magnitude, curvature sign, and gradient orientation - are sufficient
on their own to drive a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for handwritten
character recognition (HCR), offering an alternative to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). Using these three handcrafted feature maps as inputs, our
curvature-orientation MLP achieves 97 percent accuracy on MNIST digits and 89
percent on EMNIST letters. These results underscore the discriminative power of
curvature-based representations for handwritten character images and
demonstrate that the advantages of deep learning can be realized even with
interpretable, hand-engineered features.

Abstract: The modern web is saturated with multimodal content, intensifying the
challenge of detecting hateful memes, where harmful intent is often conveyed
through subtle interactions between text and image under the guise of humor or
satire. While recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise,
these models lack support for fine-grained supervision and remain susceptible
to implicit hate speech. In this paper, we present a dual-pronged approach to
improve multimodal hate detection. First, we propose a prompt optimization
framework that systematically varies prompt structure, supervision granularity,
and training modality. We show that prompt design and label scaling both
influence performance, with structured prompts improving robustness even in
small models, and InternVL2 achieving the best F1-scores across binary and
scaled settings. Second, we introduce a multimodal data augmentation pipeline
that generates 2,479 counterfactually neutral memes by isolating and rewriting
the hateful modality. This pipeline, powered by a multi-agent LLM-VLM setup,
successfully reduces spurious correlations and improves classifier
generalization. Our approaches inspire new directions for building synthetic
data to train robust and fair vision-language models. Our findings demonstrate
that prompt structure and data composition are as critical as model size, and
that targeted augmentation can support more trustworthy and context-sensitive
hate detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have predominantly relied on data-driven
approaches that leverage deep learning and large-scale datasets. Deep neural
networks have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as stereo matching and
monocular depth reconstruction. However, these methods lack explicit models of
3D geometry that can be directly analyzed, transferred across modalities, or
systematically modified for controlled experimentation. We investigate the role
of Gaussian curvature in 3D surface modeling. Besides Gaussian curvature being
an invariant quantity under change of observers or coordinate systems, we
demonstrate using the Middlebury stereo dataset that it offers: (i) a sparse
and compact description of 3D surfaces, (ii) state-of-the-art monocular and
stereo methods seem to implicitly consider it, but no explicit module of such
use can be extracted, (iii) a form of geometric prior that can inform and
improve 3D surface reconstruction, and (iv) a possible use as an unsupervised
metric for stereo methods.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful approach for
graph-based machine learning tasks. Previous work applied GNNs to image-derived
graph representations for various downstream tasks such as classification or
anomaly detection. These transformations include segmenting images, extracting
features from segments, mapping them to nodes, and connecting them. However, to
the best of our knowledge, no study has rigorously compared the effectiveness
of the numerous potential image-to-graph transformation approaches for
GNN-based graph-level anomaly detection (GLAD). In this study, we
systematically evaluate the efficacy of multiple segmentation schemes, edge
construction strategies, and node feature sets based on color, texture, and
shape descriptors to produce suitable image-derived graph representations to
perform graph-level anomaly detection. We conduct extensive experiments on
dermoscopic images using state-of-the-art GLAD models, examining performance
and efficiency in purely unsupervised, weakly supervised, and fully supervised
regimes. Our findings reveal, for example, that color descriptors contribute
the best standalone performance, while incorporating shape and texture features
consistently enhances detection efficacy. In particular, our best unsupervised
configuration using OCGTL achieves a competitive AUC-ROC score of up to 0.805
without relying on pretrained backbones like comparable image-based approaches.
With the inclusion of sparse labels, the performance increases substantially to
0.872 and with full supervision to 0.914 AUC-ROC.

Abstract: As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) gains rapid adoption in safety-critical tasks
for efficient novel-view synthesis from static images, how might an adversary
tamper images to cause harm? We introduce ComplicitSplat, the first attack that
exploits standard 3DGS shading methods to create viewpoint-specific camouflage
- colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed adversarial
content in scene objects that are visible only from specific viewpoints and
without requiring access to model architecture or weights. Our extensive
experiments show that ComplicitSplat generalizes to successfully attack a
variety of popular detector - both single-stage, multi-stage, and
transformer-based models on both real-world capture of physical objects and
synthetic scenes. To our knowledge, this is the first black-box attack on
downstream object detectors using 3DGS, exposing a novel safety risk for
applications like autonomous navigation and other mission-critical robotic
systems.

Abstract: Foundation models in medical imaging have shown promising label efficiency,
achieving high downstream performance with only a fraction of annotated data.
Here, we evaluate this in prostate multiparametric MRI using ProFound, a
domain-specific vision foundation model pretrained on large-scale prostate MRI
datasets. We investigate how variable image quality affects label-efficient
finetuning by measuring the generalisability of finetuned models. Experiments
systematically vary high-/low-quality image ratios in finetuning and evaluation
sets. Our findings indicate that image quality distribution and its
finetune-and-test mismatch significantly affect model performance. In
particular: a) Varying the ratio of high- to low-quality images between
finetuning and test sets leads to notable differences in downstream
performance; and b) The presence of sufficient high-quality images in the
finetuning set is critical for maintaining strong performance, whilst the
importance of matched finetuning and testing distribution varies between
different downstream tasks, such as automated radiology reporting and prostate
cancer detection.When quality ratios are consistent, finetuning needs far less
labeled data than training from scratch, but label efficiency depends on image
quality distribution. Without enough high-quality finetuning data, pretrained
models may fail to outperform those trained without pretraining. This
highlights the importance of assessing and aligning quality distributions
between finetuning and deployment, and the need for quality standards in
finetuning data for specific downstream tasks. Using ProFound, we show the
value of quantifying image quality in both finetuning and deployment to fully
realise the data and compute efficiency benefits of foundation models.

Abstract: Adapter-based fine-tuning has gained remarkable attention in adapting large
pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for a wide range of downstream tasks
efficiently. In this paradigm, only the inserted adapters are fine-tuned,
without the need for training the original VLM backbone. Existing works scale
adapters by integrating them into every layer of VLMs to increase the capacity
of adapters. However, these methods face two primary limitations: 1) limited
compression rate due to ignoring cross-layer redundancy, and 2) limited
representational capacity across homogeneous adapters. In this paper, we
propose a novel vision-language fine-tuning framework based on cross-layer
tensor ring decomposition (TRD) with the integration and collaboration of
diverse adapters, called AdaRing, achieving ultra-light parameter-efficient
adaptation of VLMs on various tasks. To remove the high redundancy that exists
among adapters across layers, we exploit the tensor-level low-rankness to
formulate adapters as layer-shared tensor cores and layer-specific slices.
Moreover, guided by generalization-aware fine-tuning, diverse rank-driven
adapters cooperate to handle tasks that require different representations. Our
experiments show that the proposed AdaRing achieves the state-of-the-art
performance while reducing average training parameters by 90%.

Abstract: Instructed Visual Segmentation (IVS) tasks require segmenting objects in
images or videos based on natural language instructions. While recent
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
IVS, their inference cost remains a major bottleneck, particularly in video. We
empirically analyze visual token sampling in MLLMs and observe a strong
correlation between subset token coverage and segmentation performance. This
motivates our design of a simple and effective token pruning method that
selects a compact yet spatially representative subset of tokens to accelerate
inference. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual token pruning method for
IVS, called EVTP-IV, which builds upon the k-center by integrating spatial
information to ensure better coverage. We further provide an
information-theoretic analysis to support our design. Experiments on standard
IVS benchmarks show that our method achieves up to 5X speed-up on video tasks
and 3.5X on image tasks, while maintaining comparable accuracy using only 20%
of the tokens. Our method also consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
pruning baselines under varying pruning ratios.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) in resource-constrained scenarios demands
lightweight models balancing performance and latency. Convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) offer low latency but lack non-local feature capture, while
Transformers excel at non-local modeling yet suffer slow inference. To address
this trade-off, we propose the Large Kernel Modulation Network (LKMN), a pure
CNN-based model. LKMN has two core components: Enhanced Partial Large Kernel
Block (EPLKB) and Cross-Gate Feed-Forward Network (CGFN). The EPLKB utilizes
channel shuffle to boost inter-channel interaction, incorporates channel
attention to focus on key information, and applies large kernel strip
convolutions on partial channels for non-local feature extraction with reduced
complexity. The CGFN dynamically adjusts discrepancies between input, local,
and non-local features via a learnable scaling factor, then employs a
cross-gate strategy to modulate and fuse these features, enhancing their
complementarity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight SR models while balancing quality
and efficiency. Specifically, LKMN-L achieves 0.23 dB PSNR improvement over
DAT-light on the Manga109 dataset at $\times$4 upscale, with nearly $\times$4.8
times faster. Codes are in the supplementary materials. The code is available

Abstract: We revisit the classical Sobel operator to ask a simple question: Are
first-order edge maps sufficient to drive an all-dense multilayer perceptron

derivatives as input, we train an MLP on MNIST and EMNIST Letters. Despite its
extreme simplicity, the resulting network reaches 98% accuracy on MNIST digits
and 92% on EMNIST letters -- approaching CNNs while offering a smaller memory
footprint and transparent features. Our findings highlight that much of the
class-discriminative information in handwritten character images is already
captured by first-order gradients, making edge-aware MLPs a compelling option
for HCR.

Abstract: Video grounding (VG) task focuses on locating specific moments in a video
based on a query, usually in text form. However, traditional VG struggles with
some scenarios like streaming video or queries using visual cues. To fill this
gap, we present a new task named Online Video Grounding with Hybrid-modal
Queries (OVG-HQ), which enables online segment localization using text, images,
video segments, and their combinations. This task poses two new challenges:
limited context in online settings and modality imbalance during training,
where dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones. To address these, we propose
OVG-HQ-Unify, a unified framework featuring a Parametric Memory Block (PMB)
that retain previously learned knowledge to enhance current decision and a
cross-modal distillation strategy that guides the learning of non-dominant
modalities. This design enables a single model to effectively handle
hybrid-modal queries. Due to the lack of suitable datasets, we construct
QVHighlights-Unify, an expanded dataset with multi-modal queries. Besides,
since offline metrics overlook prediction timeliness, we adapt them to the
online setting, introducing oR@n, IoU=m, and online mean Average Precision
(omAP) to evaluate both accuracy and efficiency. Experiments show that our
OVG-HQ-Unify outperforms existing models, offering a robust solution for
online, hybrid-modal video grounding. Source code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The widespread deployment of text-to-image models is challenged by their
potential to generate harmful content. While existing safety methods, such as
prompt rewriting or model fine-tuning, provide valuable interventions, they
often introduce a trade-off between safety and fidelity. Recent
localization-based approaches have shown promise, yet their reliance on
explicit ``concept replacement" can sometimes lead to semantic incongruity. To
address these limitations, we explore a more flexible detect-then-suppress
paradigm. We introduce SafeCtrl, a lightweight, non-intrusive plugin that first
precisely localizes unsafe content. Instead of performing a hard A-to-B
substitution, SafeCtrl then suppresses the harmful semantics, allowing the
generative process to naturally and coherently resolve into a safe,
context-aware alternative. A key aspect of our work is a novel training
strategy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We leverage readily
available, image-level preference data to train our module, enabling it to
learn nuanced suppression behaviors and perform region-guided interventions at
inference without requiring costly, pixel-level annotations. Extensive
experiments show that SafeCtrl significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both safety efficacy and fidelity preservation. Our findings suggest
that decoupled, suppression-based control is a highly effective and scalable
direction for building more responsible generative models.

and dependence on text-based supervision, which is often not readily available.
In this work, we present TimeSenCLIP, a lightweight framework that reevaluate
the role of spatial context by evaluating the effectiveness of a single pixel
by leveraging its temporal and spectral dimensions, for classifying LULC and
ecosystem types. By leveraging spectral and temporal information from
Sentinel-2 imagery and cross-view learning with geo-tagged ground-level photos,
we minimises the need for caption-based training while preserving semantic
alignment between overhead (satellite) and ground perspectives. Our approach is
grounded in the LUCAS and Sen4Map datasets, and evaluated on classification
tasks including LULC, crop type, and ecosystem type. We demonstrate that single
pixel inputs, when combined with temporal and spectral cues, are sufficient for
thematic mapping, offering a scalable and efficient alternative for large-scale
remote sensing applications. Code is available at

Abstract: Manual brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans is challenging due to tumor
heterogeneity, scarcity of annotated data, and class imbalance in medical
imaging datasets. Synthetic data generated by generative models has the
potential to mitigate these issues by improving dataset diversity. This study
investigates, as a proof of concept, the impact of incorporating synthetic MRI
data, generated using a pre-trained GAN model, into training a U-Net
segmentation network. Experiments were conducted using real data from the BraTS
2020 dataset, synthetic data generated with the medigan library, and hybrid
datasets combining real and synthetic samples in varying proportions. While
overall quantitative performance (Dice coefficient, IoU, precision, recall,
accuracy) was comparable between real-only and hybrid-trained models,
qualitative inspection suggested that hybrid datasets, particularly with 40%
real and 60% synthetic data, improved whole tumor boundary delineation.
However, region-wise accuracy for the tumor core and the enhancing tumor
remained lower, indicating a persistent class imbalance. The findings support
the feasibility of synthetic data as an augmentation strategy for brain tumor
segmentation, while highlighting the need for larger-scale experiments,
volumetric data consistency, and mitigating class imbalance in future work.

Abstract: Real-world environment-derived point clouds invariably exhibit noise across
varying modalities and intensities. Hence, point cloud denoising (PCD) is
essential as a preprocessing step to improve downstream task performance. Deep
learning (DL)-based PCD models, known for their strong representation
capabilities and flexible architectures, have surpassed traditional methods in
denoising performance. To our best knowledge, despite recent advances in
performance, no comprehensive survey systematically summarizes the developments
of DL-based PCD. To fill the gap, this paper seeks to identify key challenges
in DL-based PCD, summarizes the main contributions of existing methods, and
proposes a taxonomy tailored to denoising tasks. To achieve this goal, we
formulate PCD as a two-step process: outlier removal and surface noise
restoration, encompassing most scenarios and requirements of PCD. Additionally,
we compare methods in terms of similarities, differences, and respective
advantages. Finally, we discuss research limitations and future directions,
offering insights for further advancements in PCD.

Abstract: We present DynamicPose, a retraining-free 6D pose tracking framework that
improves tracking robustness in fast-moving camera and object scenarios.
Previous work is mainly applicable to static or quasi-static scenes, and its
performance significantly deteriorates when both the object and the camera move
rapidly. To overcome these challenges, we propose three synergistic components:
(1) A visual-inertial odometry compensates for the shift in the Region of
Interest (ROI) caused by camera motion; (2) A depth-informed 2D tracker
corrects ROI deviations caused by large object translation; (3) A VIO-guided
Kalman filter predicts object rotation, generates multiple candidate poses, and
then obtains the final pose by hierarchical refinement. The 6D pose tracking
results guide subsequent 2D tracking and Kalman filter updates, forming a
closed-loop system that ensures accurate pose initialization and precise pose
tracking. Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method, achieving real-time and robust 6D pose tracking for fast-moving
cameras and objects.

Abstract: This paper investigates multi-scale feature approximation and transferable
features for object detection from point clouds. Multi-scale features are
critical for object detection from point clouds. However, multi-scale feature
learning usually involves multiple neighborhood searches and scale-aware
layers, which can hinder efforts to achieve lightweight models and may not be
conducive to research constrained by limited computational resources. This
paper approximates point-based multi-scale features from a single neighborhood
based on knowledge distillation. To compensate for the loss of constructive
diversity in a single neighborhood, this paper designs a transferable feature
embedding mechanism. Specifically, class-aware statistics are employed as
transferable features given the small computational cost. In addition, this
paper introduces the central weighted intersection over union for localization
to alleviate the misalignment brought by the center offset in optimization.
Note that the method presented in this paper saves computational costs.
Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

first unified understanding and generation framework for 3D modalities. Our
unified framework employs an LLM to comprehend and decode sentences and 3D
representations. At its core, we propose a spatial decoder leveraging a latent
diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D representations. This allows for
the generation and imagination of 3D scenes based on a reference image and an
arbitrary view transformation, while remaining supports for spatial visual
question answering (VQA) tasks. Additionally, we propose a geometric-semantic
learning strategy to pretrain the vision encoder. This design jointly captures
the input's semantic and geometric cues, enhancing both spatial understanding
and generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
our method in visual representation, spatial understanding, and 3D generation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment and track objects
in videos based on natural language expressions, requiring precise alignment
between visual content and textual queries. However, existing methods often
suffer from semantic misalignment, largely due to indiscriminate frame sampling
and supervision of all visible objects during training -- regardless of their
actual relevance to the expression. To address this, we introduce a
moment-aware RVOS framework named SAMDWICH, along with a newly annotated
dataset, MeViS-M, built upon the challenging MeViS benchmark. We manually
annotate temporal moments indicating when each object is referred to by the
expression, enabling semantically grounded supervision that strengthens
video-text alignment. SAMDWICH leverages these aligned text-to-clip pairs to
guide training, significantly enhancing referential understanding. Building
upon this framework, we propose Moment-guided Dual-path Propagation (MDP), a
moment-aware propagation strategy that improves both object grounding and
tracking by training on both relevant and irrelevant frames through a
moment-centric memory mechanism. In addition, we introduce Object-level
Selective Supervision (OSS), an object-level filtering strategy that supervises
only the objects temporally aligned with the expression in each training clip.
This selective supervision reduces semantic noise and reinforces
language-conditioned learning. Extensive experiments show that SAMDWICH
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging MeViS benchmark,
particularly excelling in complex scenarios involving diverse expressions.

Abstract: Edge detection serves as a critical foundation for numerous computer vision
applications, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and image
editing, by extracting essential structural cues that define object boundaries
and salient edges. To be viable for broad deployment across devices with
varying computational capacities, edge detectors shall balance high accuracy
with low computational complexity. While deep learning has evidently improved
accuracy, they often suffer from high computational costs, limiting their
applicability on resource-constrained devices. This paper addresses the
challenge of achieving that balance: \textit{i.e.}, {how to efficiently capture
discriminative features without relying on large-size and sophisticated
models}. We propose PEdger++, a collaborative learning framework designed to
reduce computational costs and model sizes while improving edge detection
accuracy. The core principle of our PEdger++ is that cross-information derived
from heterogeneous architectures, diverse training moments, and multiple
parameter samplings, is beneficial to enhance learning from an ensemble
perspective. Extensive experimental results on the BSDS500, NYUD and Multicue
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, both quantitatively and
qualitatively, showing clear improvements over existing methods. We also
provide multiple versions of the model with varying computational requirements,
highlighting PEdger++'s adaptability with respect to different resource
constraints. Codes are accessible at

Abstract: Micro-expression analysis has applications in domains such as Human-Robot

facial movements remains difficult when relying solely on RGB cameras, due to
limitations in temporal resolution and sensitivity to motion blur. Event
cameras offer an alternative, with microsecond-level precision, high dynamic
range, and low latency. However, public datasets featuring event-based
recordings of Action Units are still scarce. In this work, we introduce a
novel, preliminary multi-resolution and multi-modal micro-expression dataset
recorded with synchronized RGB and event cameras under variable lighting
conditions. Two baseline tasks are evaluated to explore the spatial-temporal
dynamics of micro-expressions: Action Unit classification using Spiking Neural
Networks (51.23\% accuracy with events vs. 23.12\% with RGB), and frame
reconstruction using Conditional Variational Autoencoders, achieving SSIM =
0.8513 and PSNR = 26.89 dB with high-resolution event input. These promising
results show that event-based data can be used for micro-expression recognition
and frame reconstruction.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, exploring general representations
rather than task-specific ones has attracted increasing research attention. For
product understanding, although existing discriminative dual-flow architectures
drive progress in this field, they inherently struggle to model the many-to-one
alignment between multiple images and texts of products. Therefore, we argue
that generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold significant
potential for improving product representation learning. Nevertheless,
achieving this goal still remains non-trivial due to several key challenges:
the lack of multimodal and aspect-aware modeling modules in typical LLMs; the
common presence of background noise in product images; and the absence of a
standard benchmark for evaluation. To address these issues, we propose the
first generative MLLM-based model named MOON for product representation
learning. Our method (1) employs a guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module for
targeted modeling of multimodal and aspect-specific product content; (2)
effectively detects core semantic regions in product images to mitigate the
distraction and interference caused by background noise; and (3) introduces the
specialized negative sampling strategy to increase the difficulty and diversity
of negative samples. In addition, we release a large-scale multimodal benchmark
MBE for various product understanding tasks. Experimentally, our model
demonstrates competitive zero-shot performance on both our benchmark and the
public dataset, showcasing strong generalization across various downstream
tasks, including cross-modal retrieval, product classification, and attribute
prediction. Furthermore, the case study and visualization illustrate the
effectiveness of MOON for product understanding.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes from dashcam videos has attracted
increasing attention due to its significance in autonomous driving and scene
understanding. While recent advances have made impressive progress, most
methods still unify all background elements into a single representation,
hindering both instance-level understanding and flexible scene editing. Some
approaches attempt to lift 2D segmentation into 3D space, but often rely on
pre-processed instance IDs or complex pipelines to map continuous features to
discrete identities. Moreover, these methods are typically designed for indoor
scenes with rich viewpoints, making them less applicable to outdoor driving
scenarios. In this paper, we present InstDrive, an instance-aware 3D Gaussian
Splatting framework tailored for the interactive reconstruction of dynamic
driving scene. We use masks generated by SAM as pseudo ground-truth to guide 2D
feature learning via contrastive loss and pseudo-supervised objectives. At the
3D level, we introduce regularization to implicitly encode instance identities
and enforce consistency through a voxel-based loss. A lightweight static
codebook further bridges continuous features and discrete identities without
requiring data pre-processing or complex optimization. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstDrive, and to the
best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to achieve 3D instance
segmentation in dynamic, open-world driving scenes.More visualizations are

Abstract: Clinical guidelines recommend performing left ventricular (LV) linear
measurements in B-mode echocardiographic images at the basal level -- typically
at the mitral valve leaflet tips -- and aligned perpendicular to the LV long
axis along a virtual scanline (SL). However, most automated methods estimate
landmarks directly from B-mode images for the measurement task, where even
small shifts in predicted points along the LV walls can lead to significant
measurement errors, reducing their clinical reliability. A recent
semi-automatic method, EnLVAM, addresses this limitation by constraining
landmark prediction to a clinician-defined SL and training on generated
Anatomical Motion Mode (AMM) images to predict LV landmarks along the same. To
enable full automation, a contour-aware SL placement approach is proposed in
this work, in which the LV contour is estimated using a weakly supervised
B-mode landmark detector. SL placement is then performed by inferring the LV
long axis and the basal level-mimicking clinical guidelines. Building on this
foundation, we introduce \textit{WiseLVAM} -- a novel, fully automated yet
manually adaptable framework for automatically placing the SL and then
automatically performing the LV linear measurements in the AMM mode.
\textit{WiseLVAM} utilizes the structure-awareness from B-mode images and the
motion-awareness from AMM mode to enhance robustness and accuracy with the
potential to provide a practical solution for the routine clinical application.

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text

propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum-inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image-text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

motion generation by retrieving relevant 2D human motion signals. While
video-based motion RAG is nontrivial, we address two key bottlenecks: (1)
developing an effective motion-centered video retrieval model that
distinguishes human poses and actions, and (2) mitigating the issue of error
propagation caused by suboptimal retrieval results. We design the Gemini Motion
Video Retriever mechanism and the Motion-centric Dual-alignment DPO Trainer,
enabling effective retrieval and generation processes. Experimental results

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more

limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for
object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR),
which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional
detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates
detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the
spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability
of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a
more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying
image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that
PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods,
and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance.

Abstract: Generic event boundary detection (GEBD) aims to identify natural boundaries

deterministic predictions, overlooking the diversity of plausible solutions. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based boundary detection model,
dubbed DiffGEBD, that tackles the problem of GEBD from a generative
perspective. The proposed model encodes relevant changes across adjacent frames
via temporal self-similarity and then iteratively decodes random noise into
plausible event boundaries being conditioned on the encoded features.
Classifier-free guidance allows the degree of diversity to be controlled in
denoising diffusion. In addition, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
assess the quality of predictions considering both diversity and fidelity.
Experiments show that our method achieves strong performance on two standard
benchmarks, Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS, generating diverse and plausible event
boundaries.

scanner (LS) in rough indoor rooms, providing more accurate spatial
measurements for high-precision geometric model creation and renovation. Due to
different equipment limitations and environmental factors, high-end and low-end
LS have positional errors. Our approach pairs high-accuracy scanners (HAS) as
references with corresponding low-accuracy scanners (LAS) of measurements in
identical environments to quantify specific error patterns. By establishing a
statistical relationship between measurement discrepancies and their spatial
distribution, we develop a correction framework that combines traditional
geometric processing with targeted neural network refinement. This method
transforms the quantification of systematic errors into a supervised learning
problem, allowing precise correction while preserving critical geometric
features. Experimental results in our rough indoor rooms dataset show
significant improvements in measurement accuracy, with mean square error (MSE)
reductions exceeding 70% and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) improvements of

Abstract: Diffusion models have transformed image synthesis by establishing
unprecedented quality and creativity benchmarks. Nevertheless, their
large-scale deployment faces challenges due to computationally intensive
iterative denoising processes. Although post-training quantization(PTQ)
provides an effective pathway for accelerating sampling, the iterative nature
of diffusion models causes stepwise quantization errors to accumulate
progressively during generation, inevitably compromising output fidelity. To
address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that mathematically
formulates error propagation in Diffusion Models (DMs), deriving per-step
quantization error propagation equations and establishing the first closed-form
solution for cumulative error. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme. Extensive
experiments across multiple image datasets demonstrate that our compensation
strategy effectively mitigates error propagation, significantly enhancing
existing PTQ methods to achieve state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance on
low-precision diffusion models.

Abstract: Vision-and-language models (VLMs) have been increasingly explored in the
medical domain, particularly following the success of CLIP in general domain.
However, unlike the relatively straightforward pairing of 2D images and text,
curating large-scale paired data in the medical field for volumetric modalities
such as CT scans remains a challenging and time-intensive process. This
difficulty often limits the performance on downstream tasks. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel vision-language pre-training (VLP) framework,
termed as \textbf{VELVET-Med}, specifically designed for limited volumetric
data such as 3D CT and associated radiology reports. Instead of relying on
large-scale data collection, our method focuses on the development of effective
pre-training objectives and model architectures. The key contributions are: 1)
We incorporate uni-modal self-supervised learning into VLP framework, which are
often underexplored in the existing literature. 2) We propose a novel language
encoder, termed as \textbf{TriBERT}, for learning multi-level textual
semantics. 3) We devise the hierarchical contrastive learning to capture
multi-level vision-language correspondence. Using only 38,875 scan-report
pairs, our approach seeks to uncover rich spatial and semantic relationships
embedded in volumetric medical images and corresponding clinical narratives,
thereby enhancing the generalization ability of the learned encoders. The
resulting encoders exhibit strong transferability, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a wide range of downstream tasks, including 3D segmentation,
cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, and report generation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive performance on

multimodal scenarios remain underexplored. Inspired by OpenAI's o3 model, which
emulates human-like ''thinking with image'' through iterative visual
transformations and linguistic reasoning, we propose Simple o3, an end-to-end
framework that integrates dynamic tool interactions (e.g., cropping, zooming,
and reusing) into interleaved vision-language reasoning via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). Our approach features a scalable data synthesis pipeline
that generates high-quality interleaved vision-language reasoning chains via an
''observe-reason-act'' cycle, complete with executable visual operations and
rigorous verification, yielding the open-source TWI-Tools-146K dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate Simple o3's superior performance on diverse
benchmarks, outperforming existing approaches. By combining enhanced reasoning
capabilities, Simple o3 establishes a powerful yet computationally affordable
paradigm for advancing multimodal reasoning. Remarkably, we provide the first
in-depth analysis of different interleaved reasoning strategies, offering
insights into their impact on model performance. We found that by introducing
additional visual tokens for interleaved vision-language reasoning, reusing and
magnifying the original image significantly improves the model's visual
reasoning and fine-grained perception, while image cropping based on precise
visual grounding allows the model to effectively focus on key entities or
regions, further enhancing its capabilities.

Abstract: Virtual Try-On technology has garnered significant attention for its

recent advances in diffusion-based warping-free methods have improved

DualFit warps the target garment to align with the person image using a learned

the model to retain key areas and regenerate only where necessary, particularly
around garment seams. Extensive qualitative results show that DualFit achieves
visually seamless try-on results while faithfully maintaining high-frequency
garment details, striking an effective balance between reconstruction accuracy

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) are increasingly deployed in edge and
resource-constrained environments due to their efficiency in computation and
memory usage. While shown to distort the gradient landscape and weaken
conventional pixel-level attacks, it provides limited robustness against
patch-based adversarial attacks-localized, high-saliency perturbations that
remain surprisingly transferable across bit-widths. Existing defenses either
overfit to fixed quantization settings or fail to address this cross-bit
generalization vulnerability. We introduce \textbf{TriQDef}, a tri-level
quantization-aware defense framework designed to disrupt the transferability of
patch-based adversarial attacks across QNNs. TriQDef consists of: (1) a Feature
Disalignment Penalty (FDP) that enforces semantic inconsistency by penalizing
perceptual similarity in intermediate representations; (2) a Gradient
Perceptual Dissonance Penalty (GPDP) that explicitly misaligns input gradients
across bit-widths by minimizing structural and directional agreement via Edge
IoU and HOG Cosine metrics; and (3) a Joint Quantization-Aware Training
Protocol that unifies these penalties within a shared-weight training scheme
across multiple quantization levels. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet demonstrate that TriQDef reduces Attack Success Rates (ASR) by over
40\% on unseen patch and quantization combinations, while preserving high clean
accuracy. Our findings underscore the importance of disrupting both semantic
and perceptual gradient alignment to mitigate patch transferability in QNNs.

Abstract: Large-scale contrastive pre-training produces powerful Vision-and-Language
Models (VLMs) capable of generating representations (embeddings) effective for
a wide variety of visual and multimodal tasks. However, these pretrained
embeddings remain suboptimal for fine-grained open-set visual retrieval, where
state-of-the-art results require fine-tuning the vision encoder using annotated
domain-specific samples. Naively performing such fine-tuning typically leads to
catastrophic forgetting, severely diminishing the model's general-purpose
visual and cross-modal capabilities.
  In this work, we propose a fine-tuning method explicitly designed to achieve
optimal balance between fine-grained domain adaptation and retention of the
pretrained VLM's broad multimodal knowledge. Drawing inspiration from continual
learning literature, we systematically analyze standard regularization
techniques aimed at knowledge retention and propose an efficient and effective
combination strategy. Additionally, we address the commonly overlooked yet
critical aspects of validation set design and hyperparameter tuning to ensure
reproducibility and robust generalization across datasets and pretrained
models. We extensively evaluate our method on both fine-grained and
coarse-grained image-image and image-text retrieval benchmarks. Our approach
consistently achieves strong results, notably retaining the visual-text
alignment without utilizing any text data or the original text encoder during
fine-tuning. Code and model checkpoints: https://github.com/nikosips/infusing .

Abstract: Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a non-invasive method for
assessing cardiac structure, function, and blood flow. Cine MRI extends this by
capturing heart motion, providing detailed insights into cardiac mechanics. To
reduce scan time and breath-hold discomfort, fast acquisition techniques have
been utilized at the cost of lowering image quality. Recently, Implicit Neural
Representation (INR) methods have shown promise in unsupervised reconstruction
by learning coordinate-to-value mappings from undersampled data, enabling
high-quality image recovery. However, current existing INR methods primarily
focus on using coordinate-based positional embeddings to learn the mapping,
while overlooking the feature representations of the target point and its
neighboring context. In this work, we propose KP-INR, a dual-branch INR method
operating in k-space for cardiac cine MRI reconstruction: one branch processes
the positional embedding of k-space coordinates, while the other learns from
local multi-scale k-space feature representations at those coordinates. By
enabling cross-branch interaction and approximating the target k-space values
from both branches, KP-INR can achieve strong performance on challenging
Cartesian k-space data. Experiments on the CMRxRecon2024 dataset confirms its
improved performance over baseline models and highlights its potential in this
field.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) memorize training images and can reproduce
near-duplicates during generation. Current detection methods identify verbatim
memorization but fail to capture two critical aspects: quantifying partial
memorization occurring in small image regions, and memorization patterns beyond
specific prompt-image pairs. To address these limitations, we propose
Foreground Background Memorization (FB-Mem), a novel segmentation-based metric
that classifies and quantifies memorized regions within generated images. Our
method reveals that memorization is more pervasive than previously understood:
(1) individual generations from single prompts may be linked to clusters of
similar training images, revealing complex memorization patterns that extend
beyond one-to-one correspondences; and (2) existing model-level mitigation
methods, such as neuron deactivation and pruning, fail to eliminate local
memorization, which persists particularly in foreground regions. Our work
establishes an effective framework for measuring memorization in diffusion
models, demonstrates the inadequacy of current mitigation approaches, and
proposes a stronger mitigation method using a clustering approach.

Abstract: Emotion is a critical component of artificial social intelligence. However,
while current methods excel in lip synchronization and image quality, they
often fail to generate accurate and controllable emotional expressions while
preserving the subject's identity. To address this challenge, we introduce
RealTalk, a novel framework for synthesizing emotional talking heads with high
emotion accuracy, enhanced emotion controllability, and robust identity
preservation. RealTalk employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate 3D
facial landmarks from driving audio, which are concatenated with emotion-label
embeddings using a ResNet-based landmark deformation model (LDM) to produce
emotional landmarks. These landmarks and facial blendshape coefficients jointly
condition a novel tri-plane attention Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to
synthesize highly realistic emotional talking heads. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RealTalk outperforms existing methods in emotion accuracy,
controllability, and identity preservation, advancing the development of
socially intelligent AI systems.

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving

collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

Abstract: Feature lifting has emerged as a crucial component in 3D scene understanding,
enabling the attachment of rich image feature descriptors (e.g., DINO, CLIP)
onto splat-based 3D representations. The core challenge lies in optimally
assigning rich general attributes to 3D primitives while addressing the
inconsistency issues from multi-view images. We present a unified, kernel- and
feature-agnostic formulation of the feature lifting problem as a sparse linear
inverse problem, which can be solved efficiently in closed form. Our approach
admits a provable upper bound on the global optimal error under convex losses
for delivering high quality lifted features. To address inconsistencies and
noise in multi-view observations, we introduce two complementary regularization
strategies to stabilize the solution and enhance semantic fidelity. Tikhonov
Guidance enforces numerical stability through soft diagonal dominance, while
Post-Lifting Aggregation filters noisy inputs via feature clustering. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
on open-vocabulary 3D segmentation benchmarks, outperforming training-based,
grouping-based, and heuristic-forward baselines while producing the lifted
features in minutes. Code is available at

Abstract: Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) is a radiation-free, high-resolution
modality but remains limited for musculoskeletal imaging due to conventional
ray-based reconstructions that neglect strong scattering. We propose a
generative neural physics framework that couples generative networks with
physics-informed neural simulation for fast, high-fidelity 3D USCT. By learning
a compact surrogate of ultrasonic wave propagation from only dozens of
cross-modality images, our method merges the accuracy of wave modeling with the
efficiency and stability of deep learning. This enables accurate quantitative
imaging of in vivo musculoskeletal tissues, producing spatial maps of acoustic
properties beyond reflection-mode images. On synthetic and in vivo data
(breast, arm, leg), we reconstruct 3D maps of tissue parameters in under ten
minutes, with sensitivity to biomechanical properties in muscle and bone and
resolution comparable to MRI. By overcoming computational bottlenecks in
strongly scattering regimes, this approach advances USCT toward routine
clinical assessment of musculoskeletal disease.

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) in complex environments remains a challenging
research topic. Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with
negligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and
infrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the
damage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with
pixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel
Weather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of
14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding
ground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm
generalization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and
a real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean
images, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we
propose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network
(WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture.
Specifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep
features, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted
from the backbone with weather features for SOD. Comprehensive comparisons
against 17 SOD methods shows that our WFANet achieves superior performance on
WXSOD. The code and benchmark results will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Low-rank tensor representation (LRTR) has emerged as a powerful tool for
multi-dimensional data processing. However, classical LRTR-based methods face
two critical limitations: (1) they typically assume that the holistic data is
low-rank, this assumption is often violated in real-world scenarios with
significant spatial variations; and (2) they are constrained to discrete
meshgrid data, limiting their flexibility and applicability. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a Superpixel-informed Continuous low-rank Tensor
Representation (SCTR) framework, which enables continuous and flexible modeling
of multi-dimensional data beyond traditional grid-based constraints. Our
approach introduces two main innovations: First, motivated by the observation
that semantically coherent regions exhibit stronger low-rank characteristics
than holistic data, we employ superpixels as the basic modeling units. This
design not only encodes rich semantic information, but also enhances
adaptability to diverse forms of data streams. Second, we propose a novel
asymmetric low-rank tensor factorization (ALTF) where superpixel-specific
factor matrices are parameterized by a shared neural network with specialized
heads. By strategically separating global pattern learning from local
adaptation, this framework efficiently captures both cross-superpixel
commonalities and within-superpixel variations. This yields a representation
that is both highly expressive and compact, balancing model efficiency with
adaptability. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate
that SCTR achieves 3-5 dB PSNR improvements over existing LRTR-based methods
across multispectral images, videos, and color images.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, existing research on Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) mainly focuses on general visual understanding, overlooking the
ability to integrate textual context associated with objects for a more
context-aware multimodal understanding -- an ability we refer to as
Region-level Context-aware Multimodal Understanding (RCMU). To address this
limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond
to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information
of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose
Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which
incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to
utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual
content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we
introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset
that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\&P-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal
personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free
evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the
region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL
models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental
results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding
performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications
in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation. Our data, model and benchmark

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by discrete binary activations,
offer high computational efficiency and low energy consumption, making them
well-suited for computation-intensive tasks such as stereo image restoration.
In this work, we propose SNNSIR, a simple yet effective Spiking Neural Network
for Stereo Image Restoration, specifically designed under the spike-driven
paradigm where neurons transmit information through sparse, event-based binary
spikes. In contrast to existing hybrid SNN-ANN models that still rely on
operations such as floating-point matrix division or exponentiation, which are
incompatible with the binary and event-driven nature of SNNs, our proposed
SNNSIR adopts a fully spike-driven architecture to achieve low-power and
hardware-friendly computation. To address the expressiveness limitations of
binary spiking neurons, we first introduce a lightweight Spike Residual Basic
Block (SRBB) to enhance information flow via spike-compatible residual
learning. Building on this, the Spike Stereo Convolutional Modulation (SSCM)
module introduces simplified nonlinearity through element-wise multiplication
and highlights noise-sensitive regions via cross-view-aware modulation.
Complementing this, the Spike Stereo Cross-Attention (SSCA) module further
improves stereo correspondence by enabling efficient bidirectional feature
interaction across views within a spike-compatible framework. Extensive
experiments on diverse stereo image restoration tasks, including rain streak
removal, raindrop removal, low-light enhancement, and super-resolution
demonstrate that our model achieves competitive restoration performance while
significantly reducing computational overhead. These results highlight the
potential for real-time, low-power stereo vision applications. The code will be

allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware
constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model
scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific

  Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to

Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through
automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity
and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate

alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA
customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing

noisy pseudo labels generated by large foundation models such as CLIP. To this

from the similarity between the CLIP text and image features. Furthermore, we
design inter-instance and inter-cluster contrastive losses to encode images
into a class-aware latent space, and an inter-domain contrastive loss to
alleviate domain discrepancies. We also learn a novel cross-domain mapping
function in closed-form, using only CLIP text embeddings to project image
features from one domain to another, thereby further aligning the image
features for retrieval. Finally, we enhance the zero-shot generalization
ability of our CLAIR to handle novel categories by introducing an extra set of
learnable prompts. Extensive experiments are carried out using TUBerlin,
Sketchy, Quickdraw, and DomainNet zero-shot datasets, where our CLAIR
consistently shows superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art

methods increase point density through temporal aggregation with ego-motion
compensation, but this approach introduces scatter from dynamic objects,
degrading detection performance. We propose DoppDrive, a novel Doppler-Driven
temporal aggregation method that enhances radar point cloud density while
minimizing scatter. Points from previous frames are shifted radially according
to their dynamic Doppler component to eliminate radial scatter, with each point
assigned a unique aggregation duration based on its Doppler and angle to
minimize tangential scatter. DoppDrive is a point cloud density enhancement
step applied before detection, compatible with any detector, and we demonstrate
that it significantly improves object detection performance across various

Abstract: Head-mounted displays (HMDs) are essential for experiencing extended reality

upper part of the user's face, complicating external video recording and
significantly impacting social XR applications such as teleconferencing, where
facial expressions and eye gaze details are crucial for creating an immersive
experience. This study introduces a geometry-aware learning-based framework to
jointly remove HMD occlusions and reconstruct complete 3D facial geometry from
RGB frames captured from a single viewpoint. The method integrates a GAN-based
video inpainting network, guided by dense facial landmarks and a single
occlusion-free reference frame, to restore missing facial regions while
preserving identity. Subsequently, a SynergyNet-based module regresses 3D
Morphable Model (3DMM) parameters from the inpainted frames, enabling accurate
3D face reconstruction. Dense landmark optimization is incorporated throughout
the pipeline to improve both the inpainting quality and the fidelity of the
recovered geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
framework can successfully remove HMDs from RGB facial videos while maintaining
facial identity and realism, producing photorealistic 3D face geometry outputs.
Ablation studies further show that the framework remains robust across
different landmark densities, with only minor quality degradation under sparse

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of image generation techniques, robust forgery
detection has become increasingly imperative to ensure the trustworthiness of
digital media. Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of
pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the
misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the
model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a
novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction
learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting
the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we
specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space
shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic
concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a
visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction
between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing
discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery
feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies
to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two
standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD,
which achieves superior results compared to existing methods. The code is

Abstract: The severe image degradation in underwater environments impairs object
detection models, as traditional image enhancement methods are often not
optimized for such downstream tasks. To address this, we propose AquaFeat, a
novel, plug-and-play module that performs task-driven feature enhancement. Our
approach integrates a multi-scale feature enhancement network trained
end-to-end with the detector's loss function, ensuring the enhancement process
is explicitly guided to refine features most relevant to the detection task.
When integrated with YOLOv8m on challenging underwater datasets, AquaFeat
achieves state-of-the-art Precision (0.877) and Recall (0.624), along with
competitive mAP scores (mAP@0.5 of 0.677 and mAP@[0.5:0.95] of 0.421). By
delivering these accuracy gains while maintaining a practical processing speed
of 46.5 FPS, our model provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for real-world applications, such as marine ecosystem monitoring and
infrastructure inspection.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The Mamba architecture has emerged as a promising alternative to CNNs and
Transformers for image deblurring. However, its flatten-and-scan strategy often
results in local pixel forgetting and channel redundancy, limiting its ability
to effectively aggregate 2D spatial information. Although existing methods
mitigate this by modifying the scan strategy or incorporating local feature
modules, it increase computational complexity and hinder real-time performance.
In this paper, we propose a structure-aware image deblurring network without
changing the original Mamba architecture. Specifically, we design a memory
buffer mechanism to preserve historical information for later fusion, enabling
reliable modeling of relevance between adjacent features. Additionally, we
introduce an Ising-inspired regularization loss that simulates the energy
minimization of the physical system's "mutual attraction" between pixels,
helping to maintain image structure and coherence. Building on this, we develop
MBMamba. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on widely used benchmarks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Analyzing hand-object interaction in egocentric vision facilitates VR/AR
applications and human-robot policy transfer. Existing research has mostly
focused on modeling the behavior paradigm of interactive actions (i.e., ``how
to interact''). However, the more challenging and fine-grained problem of
capturing the critical moments of contact and separation between the hand and
the target object (i.e., ``when to interact'') is still underexplored, which is
crucial for immersive interactive experiences in mixed reality and robotic
motion planning. Therefore, we formulate this problem as temporal interaction
localization (TIL). Some recent works extract semantic masks as TIL references,
but suffer from inaccurate object grounding and cluttered scenarios. Although
current temporal action localization (TAL) methods perform well in detecting
verb-noun action segments, they rely on category annotations during training
and exhibit limited precision in localizing hand-object contact/separation
moments. To address these issues, we propose a novel zero-shot approach dubbed
EgoLoc to localize hand-object contact and separation timestamps in egocentric
videos. EgoLoc introduces hand-dynamics-guided sampling to generate
high-quality visual prompts. It exploits the vision-language model to identify
contact/separation attributes, localize specific timestamps, and provide
closed-loop feedback for further refinement. EgoLoc eliminates the need for
object masks and verb-noun taxonomies, leading to generalizable zero-shot
implementation. Comprehensive experiments on the public dataset and our novel
benchmarks demonstrate that EgoLoc achieves plausible TIL for egocentric
videos. It is also validated to effectively facilitate multiple downstream
applications in egocentric vision and robotic manipulation tasks. Code and
relevant data will be released at https://github.com/IRMVLab/EgoLoc.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising framework for training
agents using pre-collected datasets without the need for further environment
interaction. However, policies trained on offline data often struggle to
generalise due to limited exposure to diverse states. The complexity of visual
data introduces additional challenges such as noise, distractions, and spurious
correlations, which can misguide the policy and increase the risk of
overfitting if the training data is not sufficiently diverse. Indeed, this
makes it challenging to leverage vision-based offline data in training robust
agents that can generalize to unseen environments. To solve this problem, we
propose a simple approach generating additional synthetic training data. We
propose a two-step process, first augmenting the originally collected offline
data to improve zero-shot generalization by introducing diversity, then using a
diffusion model to generate additional data in latent space. We test our method
across both continuous action spaces (Visual D4RL) and discrete action spaces
(Procgen), demonstrating that it significantly improves generalization without
requiring any algorithmic changes to existing model-free offline RL methods. We
show that our method not only increases the diversity of the training data but
also significantly reduces the generalization gap at test time while
maintaining computational efficiency. We believe this approach could fuel
additional progress in generating synthetic data to train more general agents
in the future.

Abstract: Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while
survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict
critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from
whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning
have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However,
existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial
relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent
interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges,
we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel
framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and
models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely
provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring
post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and
cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark
datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method,
IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the
way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology.

Abstract: Ensemble-based attacks have been proven to be effective in enhancing
adversarial transferability by aggregating the outputs of models with various
architectures. However, existing research primarily focuses on refining
ensemble weights or optimizing the ensemble path, overlooking the exploration
of ensemble models to enhance the transferability of adversarial attacks. To
address this gap, we propose applying adversarial augmentation to the surrogate
models, aiming to boost overall generalization of ensemble models and reduce
the risk of adversarial overfitting. Meanwhile, observing that ensemble Vision
Transformers (ViTs) gain less attention, we propose ViT-EnsembleAttack based on
the idea of model adversarial augmentation, the first ensemble-based attack
method tailored for ViTs to the best of our knowledge. Our approach generates
augmented models for each surrogate ViT using three strategies: Multi-head
dropping, Attention score scaling, and MLP feature mixing, with the associated
parameters optimized by Bayesian optimization. These adversarially augmented
models are ensembled to generate adversarial examples. Furthermore, we
introduce Automatic Reweighting and Step Size Enlargement modules to boost
transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViT-EnsembleAttack
significantly enhances the adversarial transferability of ensemble-based
attacks on ViTs, outperforming existing methods by a substantial margin. Code

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements, current Text-to-Image (T2I) models struggle
with complex, long-form textual instructions, frequently failing to accurately
render intricate details, spatial relationships, or specific constraints. This
limitation is highlighted by benchmarks such as LongBench-T2I, which reveal
deficiencies in handling composition, specific text, and fine textures. To
address this, we propose DeCoT (Decomposition-CoT), a novel framework that
leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance T2I models'
understanding and execution of complex instructions. DeCoT operates in two core
stages: first, Complex Instruction Decomposition and Semantic Enhancement,
where an LLM breaks down raw instructions into structured, actionable semantic
units and clarifies ambiguities; second, Multi-Stage Prompt Integration and
Adaptive Generation, which transforms these units into a hierarchical or
optimized single prompt tailored for existing T2I models. Extensive experiments
on the LongBench-T2I dataset demonstrate that DeCoT consistently and
substantially improves the performance of leading T2I models across all
evaluated dimensions, particularly in challenging aspects like "Text" and
"Composition". Quantitative results, validated by multiple MLLM evaluators
(Gemini-2.0-Flash and InternVL3-78B), show that DeCoT, when integrated with
Infinity-8B, achieves an average score of 3.52, outperforming the baseline
Infinity-8B (3.44). Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of each
DeCoT component and the importance of sophisticated LLM prompting. Furthermore,
human evaluations corroborate these findings, indicating superior perceptual
quality and instruction fidelity. DeCoT effectively bridges the gap between
high-level user intent and T2I model requirements, leading to more faithful and
accurate image generation.

Abstract: Prompt learning has propelled vision-language models like CLIP to excel in
diverse tasks, making them ideal for federated learning due to computational
efficiency. However, conventional approaches that rely solely on final-layer
features miss out on rich multi-scale visual cues and domain-specific style
variations in decentralized client data. To bridge this gap, we introduce
FedCSAP (Federated Cross-Modal Style-Aware Prompt Generation). Our framework
harnesses low, mid, and high-level features from CLIP's vision encoder
alongside client-specific style indicators derived from batch-level statistics.
By merging intricate visual details with textual context, FedCSAP produces
robust, context-aware prompt tokens that are both distinct and non-redundant,
thereby boosting generalization across seen and unseen classes. Operating
within a federated learning paradigm, our approach ensures data privacy through
local training and global aggregation, adeptly handling non-IID class
distributions and diverse domain-specific styles. Comprehensive experiments on
multiple image classification datasets confirm that FedCSAP outperforms
existing federated prompt learning methods in both accuracy and overall
generalization.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
continue to face challenges in complex visual reasoning tasks that demand deep
contextual understanding, multi-angle analysis, or meticulous detail
recognition. Existing approaches often rely on single-shot image encoding and
prompts, limiting their ability to fully capture nuanced visual information.
Inspired by the notion that strategically generated "additional" information
can serve as beneficial contextual augmentation, we propose Multi-Perspective
Contextual Augmentation for Reasoning (MPCAR), a novel inference-time strategy
designed to enhance LVLM performance. MPCAR operates in three stages: first, an
LVLM generates N diverse and complementary descriptions or preliminary
reasoning paths from various angles; second, these descriptions are
intelligently integrated with the original question to construct a
comprehensive context-augmented prompt; and finally, this enriched prompt
guides the ultimate LVLM for deep reasoning and final answer generation.
Crucially, MPCAR achieves these enhancements without requiring any fine-tuning
of the underlying LVLM's parameters. Extensive experiments on challenging
Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, including GQA, VQA-CP v2, and
ScienceQA (Image-VQA), demonstrate that MPCAR consistently outperforms
established baseline methods. Our quantitative results show significant
accuracy gains, particularly on tasks requiring robust contextual
understanding, while human evaluations confirm improved coherence and
completeness of the generated answers. Ablation studies further highlight the
importance of diverse prompt templates and the number of generated
perspectives. This work underscores the efficacy of leveraging LVLMs' inherent
generative capabilities to enrich input contexts, thereby unlocking their
latent reasoning potential for complex multimodal tasks.

incorporating comprehensive scene understanding and a task-specialized
structure with VLMs. In particular, we introduce preliminary scene interaction
and specialized expert adapters within the same driving task structure, which
better align VLMs with autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, our approach
is designed to be fully compatible with existing VLMs while seamlessly
integrating with planning-oriented driving systems. Extensive experiments on
the DriveLM and nuScenes-QA datasets demonstrate that LMAD significantly boosts
the performance of existing VLMs on driving reasoning tasks,setting a new

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (S4) has advanced remote sensing (RS)

models, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we propose S5,
the first scalable framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation in RS,
which unlocks the potential of vast unlabeled Earth observation data typically
underutilized due to costly pixel-level annotations. Built upon existing
large-scale RS datasets, S5 introduces a data selection strategy that
integrates entropy-based filtering and diversity expansion, resulting in the
RS4P-1M dataset. Using this dataset, we systematically scales S4 methods by
pre-training RS foundation models (RSFMs) of varying sizes on this extensive
corpus, significantly boosting their performance on land cover segmentation and
object detection tasks. Furthermore, during fine-tuning, we incorporate a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based multi-dataset fine-tuning approach, which
enables efficient adaptation to multiple RS benchmarks with fewer parameters.
This approach improves the generalization and versatility of RSFMs across
diverse RS benchmarks. The resulting RSFMs achieve state-of-the-art performance
across all benchmarks, underscoring the viability of scaling semi-supervised
learning for RS applications. All datasets, code, and models will be released

diverse pathological changes of liver tissue complicate the accurate detection

SRMA-Mamba performs selective Mamba scans within liver cirrhotic tissues and

volumetric segmentation of pathological liver structures. Furthermore, we

In this paper, we introduce \textbf{TiP4GEN}, an advanced text-to-dynamic

\textbf{Dual-branch Generation Model} consisting of a panorama branch and a
perspective branch, responsible for global and local view generation,
respectively. A bidirectional cross-attention mechanism facilitates
comprehensive information exchange between the branches. For scene
reconstruction, we propose a \textbf{Geometry-aligned Reconstruction Model}
based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. By aligning spatial-temporal point clouds using
metric depth maps and initializing scene cameras with estimated poses, our
method ensures geometric consistency and temporal coherence for the
reconstructed scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of

Abstract: By comparing biological and artificial perception through the lens of
illusions, we highlight critical differences in how each system constructs
visual reality. Understanding these divergences can inform the development of
more robust, interpretable, and human-aligned artificial intelligence (AI)
vision systems. In particular, visual illusions expose how human perception is
based on contextual assumptions rather than raw sensory data. As artificial
vision systems increasingly perform human-like tasks, it is important to ask:
does AI experience illusions, too? Does it have unique illusions? This article
explores how AI responds to classic visual illusions that involve color, size,
shape, and motion. We find that some illusion-like effects can emerge in these
models, either through targeted training or as by-products of pattern
recognition. In contrast, we also identify illusions unique to AI, such as
pixel-level sensitivity and hallucinations, that lack human counterparts. By
systematically comparing human and AI responses to visual illusions, we uncover
alignment gaps and AI-specific perceptual vulnerabilities invisible to human
perception. These findings provide insights for future research on vision
systems that preserve human-beneficial perceptual biases while avoiding
distortions that undermine trust and safety.

external knowledge to alleviate these inconsistencies, thereby bolstering model
robustness. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks and two widely

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learning approaches require expensive alignment
pre-training to bridge vision and language modalities, typically projecting
visual features into discrete text token spaces. We challenge both fundamental
assumptions underlying this paradigm by proposing Inverse-LLaVA, a novel
approach that eliminates alignment pre-training entirely while inverting the
conventional mapping direction. Rather than projecting visual features to text
space, our method maps text embeddings into continuous visual representation
space and performs fusion within transformer intermediate layers. Through
selective additive components in attention mechanisms, we enable dynamic
integration of visual and textual representations without requiring massive
image-text alignment datasets. Comprehensive experiments across nine multimodal
benchmarks demonstrate nuanced performance trade-offs: Inverse-LLaVA achieves
notable improvements on reasoning-intensive and cognitive tasks (MM-VET: +0.2%,
VizWiz: +1.8%, ScienceQA: +0.2%, cognitive reasoning: +27.2%), while showing
expected decreases in perception tasks requiring memorized visual-text
associations (celebrity recognition: -49.5%, OCR: -21.3%). These results
provide the first empirical evidence that alignment pre-training is not
necessary for effective multimodal learning, particularly for complex reasoning
tasks. Our work establishes the feasibility of a new paradigm that reduces
computational requirements by 45%, challenges conventional wisdom about
modality fusion, and opens new research directions for efficient multimodal

Abstract: Accurate assessment of neuromuscular reflexes, such as the H-reflex, plays a
critical role in sports science, rehabilitation, and clinical neurology.
Traditional analysis of H-reflex EMG waveforms is subject to variability and
interpretation bias among clinicians and researchers, limiting reliability and
standardization. To address these challenges, we propose a Fine-Tuned
Vision-Language Model (VLM) Consortium and a reasoning Large-Language Model
(LLM)-enabled Decision Support System for automated H-reflex waveform
interpretation and diagnosis. Our approach leverages multiple VLMs, each
fine-tuned on curated datasets of H-reflex EMG waveform images annotated with
clinical observations, recovery timelines, and athlete metadata. These models
are capable of extracting key electrophysiological features and predicting
neuromuscular states, including fatigue, injury, and recovery, directly from
EMG images and contextual metadata. Diagnostic outputs from the VLM consortium
are aggregated using a consensus-based method and refined by a specialized
reasoning LLM, which ensures robust, transparent, and explainable decision
support for clinicians and sports scientists. The end-to-end platform
orchestrates seamless communication between the VLM ensemble and the reasoning
LLM, integrating prompt engineering strategies and automated reasoning
workflows using LLM Agents. Experimental results demonstrate that this hybrid
system delivers highly accurate, consistent, and interpretable H-reflex
assessments, significantly advancing the automation and standardization of

Abstract: Skin cancer classification is a crucial task in medical image analysis, where
precise differentiation between malignant and non-malignant lesions is
essential for early diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we explore
Sequential and Parallel Hybrid CNN-Transformer models with Convolutional
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CKAN). Our approach integrates transfer learning and
extensive data augmentation, where CNNs extract local spatial features,
Transformers model global dependencies, and CKAN facilitates nonlinear feature
fusion for improved representation learning. To assess generalization, we
evaluate our models on multiple benchmark datasets (HAM10000,BCN20000 and
PAD-UFES) under varying data distributions and class imbalances. Experimental
results demonstrate that hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures effectively
capture both spatial and contextual features, leading to improved
classification performance. Additionally, the integration of CKAN enhances
feature fusion through learnable activation functions, yielding more
discriminative representations. Our proposed approach achieves competitive
performance in skin cancer classification, demonstrating 92.81% accuracy and
92.47% F1-score on the HAM10000 dataset, 97.83% accuracy and 97.83% F1-score on
the PAD-UFES dataset, and 91.17% accuracy with 91.79% F1- score on the BCN20000
dataset highlighting the effectiveness and generalizability of our model across
diverse datasets. This study highlights the significance of feature
representation and model design in advancing robust and accurate medical image
classification.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age
individuals. Early detection of DR can reduce the risk of vision loss by up to
95%, but a shortage of retinologists and challenges in timely examination
complicate detection. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models using retinal fundus
photographs (RFPs) offer a promising solution. However, adoption in clinical
settings is hindered by low-quality data and biases that may lead AI systems to
learn unintended features. To address these challenges, we developed RAIS-DR, a
Responsible AI System for DR screening that incorporates ethical principles
across the AI lifecycle. RAIS-DR integrates efficient convolutional models for
preprocessing, quality assessment, and three specialized DR classification
models. We evaluated RAIS-DR against the FDA-approved EyeArt system on a local
dataset of 1,046 patients, unseen by both systems. RAIS-DR demonstrated
significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 5-12%, accuracy by
6-19%, and specificity by 10-20%. Additionally, fairness metrics such as
Disparate Impact and Equal Opportunity Difference indicated equitable
performance across demographic subgroups, underscoring RAIS-DR's potential to
reduce healthcare disparities. These results highlight RAIS-DR as a robust and
ethically aligned solution for DR screening in clinical settings. The code,

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual and text modalities to enable
multimodal understanding and generation. These models typically combine a
Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder and a Large Language Model (LLM)
for text generation. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient fine-tuning
method to adapt pre-trained models to new tasks by introducing low-rank updates
to their weights. While LoRA has emerged as a powerful technique for
fine-tuning large models by introducing low-rank updates, current
implementations assume a fixed rank, potentially limiting flexibility and
efficiency across diverse tasks. This paper introduces
\textit{LangVision-LoRA-NAS}, a novel framework that integrates Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) with LoRA to optimize VLMs for variable-rank
adaptation. Our approach leverages NAS to dynamically search for the optimal
LoRA rank configuration tailored to specific multimodal tasks, balancing
performance and computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments using
the LLaMA-3.2-11B model on several datasets, LangVision-LoRA-NAS demonstrates
notable improvement in model performance while reducing fine-tuning costs. Our

Abstract: Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps provide a structured, top-down abstraction that is

Transformers (CVT) for learning to map camera images to three BEV's channels -
road, lane markings, and planned trajectory - using a realistic simulator for
urban driving. Our study examines generalization to unseen towns, the effect of
different camera layouts, and two loss formulations (focal and L1). Using
training data from only a town, a four-camera CVT trained with the L1 loss
delivers the most robust test performance, evaluated in a new town. Overall,
our results underscore CVT's promise for mapping camera inputs to reasonably
accurate BEV maps.

Abstract: Personalized expression recognition (ER) involves adapting a machine learning
model to subject-specific data for improved recognition of expressions with
considerable interpersonal variability. Subject-specific ER can benefit
significantly from multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods, where each
domain corresponds to a specific subject, to improve model accuracy and
robustness. Despite promising results, state-of-the-art MSDA approaches often
overlook multimodal information or blend sources into a single domain, limiting
subject diversity and failing to explicitly capture unique subject-specific
characteristics. To address these limitations, we introduce MuSACo, a
multi-modal subject-specific selection and adaptation method for ER based on
co-training. It leverages complementary information across multiple modalities
and multiple source domains for subject-specific adaptation. This makes MuSACo
particularly relevant for affective computing applications in digital health,
such as patient-specific assessment for stress or pain, where subject-level
nuances are crucial. MuSACo selects source subjects relevant to the target and
generates pseudo-labels using the dominant modality for class-aware learning,
in conjunction with a class-agnostic loss to learn from less confident target
samples. Finally, source features from each modality are aligned, while only
confident target features are combined. Our experimental results on challenging
multimodal ER datasets: BioVid and StressID, show that MuSACo can outperform
UDA (blending) and state-of-the-art MSDA methods.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has intensified the challenge of
detecting and interpreting visual forgeries, necessitating robust frameworks
for image forgery detection while providing reasoning as well as localization.
While existing works approach this problem using supervised training for
specific manipulation or anomaly detection in the embedding space,
generalization across domains remains a challenge. We frame this problem of
forgery detection as a prompt-driven visual reasoning task, leveraging the
semantic alignment capabilities of large vision-language models. We propose a
framework, `REVEAL` (Reasoning and Evaluation of Visual Evidence through
Aligned Language), that incorporates generalized guidelines. We propose two
tangential approaches - (1) Holistic Scene-level Evaluation that relies on the
physics, semantics, perspective, and realism of the image as a whole and (2)
Region-wise anomaly detection that splits the image into multiple regions and
analyzes each of them. We conduct experiments over datasets from different
domains (Photoshop, DeepFake and AIGC editing). We compare the Vision Language
Models against competitive baselines and analyze the reasoning provided by
them.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Deep learning techniques have made significant advancements in
reference-based colorization by training on large-scale datasets. However,
directly applying these methods to the task of colorizing old photos is
challenging due to the lack of ground truth and the notorious domain gap
between natural gray images and old photos. To address this issue, we propose a
novel CNN-based algorithm called SFAC, i.e., Structure-preserving Feature
Alignment Colorizer. SFAC is trained on only two images for old photo
colorization, eliminating the reliance on big data and allowing direct
processing of the old photo itself to overcome the domain gap problem. Our
primary objective is to establish semantic correspondence between the two
images, ensuring that semantically related objects have similar colors. We
achieve this through a feature distribution alignment loss that remains robust
to different metric choices. However, utilizing robust semantic correspondence
to transfer color from the reference to the old photo can result in inevitable
structure distortions. To mitigate this, we introduce a structure-preserving
mechanism that incorporates a perceptual constraint at the feature level and a
frozen-updated pyramid at the pixel level. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method for old photo colorization, as confirmed by
qualitative and quantitative metrics.

Abstract: Human action understanding serves as a foundational pillar in the field of
intelligent motion perception. Skeletons serve as a modality- and
device-agnostic representation for human modeling, and skeleton-based action
understanding has potential applications in humanoid robot control and
interaction. \RED{However, existing works often lack the scalability and
generalization required to handle diverse action understanding tasks. There is
no skeleton foundation model that can be adapted to a wide range of action
understanding tasks}. This paper presents a Unified Skeleton-based Dense
Representation Learning (USDRL) framework, which serves as a foundational model
for skeleton-based human action understanding. USDRL consists of a
Transformer-based Dense Spatio-Temporal Encoder (DSTE), Multi-Grained Feature
Decorrelation (MG-FD), and Multi-Perspective Consistency Training (MPCT). The
DSTE module adopts two parallel streams to learn temporal dynamic and spatial
structure features. The MG-FD module collaboratively performs feature
decorrelation across temporal, spatial, and instance domains to reduce
dimensional redundancy and enhance information extraction. The MPCT module
employs both multi-view and multi-modal self-supervised consistency training.
The former enhances the learning of high-level semantics and mitigates the
impact of low-level discrepancies, while the latter effectively facilitates the
learning of informative multimodal features. We perform extensive experiments
on 25 benchmarks across across 9 skeleton-based action understanding tasks,
covering coarse prediction, dense prediction, and transferred prediction. Our
approach significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. We
hope that this work would broaden the scope of research in skeleton-based
action understanding and encourage more attention to dense prediction tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Many reasoning techniques for large multimodal models adapt language model
approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which express reasoning
as word sequences. While effective for text, these methods are suboptimal for
multimodal contexts, struggling to align audio, visual, and textual information
dynamically. To explore an alternative paradigm, we propose the Multimodal
Chain of Continuous Thought (MCOUT), which enables reasoning directly in a
joint latent space rather than in natural language. In MCOUT, the reasoning
state is represented as a continuous hidden vector, iteratively refined and
aligned with visual and textual embeddings, inspired by human reflective
cognition. We develop two variants: MCOUT-Base, which reuses the language
model`s last hidden state as the continuous thought for iterative reasoning,
and MCOUT-Multi, which integrates multimodal latent attention to strengthen
cross-modal alignment between visual and textual features. Experiments on
benchmarks including MMMU, ScienceQA, and MMStar show that MCOUT consistently
improves multimodal reasoning, yielding up to 8.23% accuracy gains over strong
baselines and improving BLEU scores up to 8.27% across multiple-choice and
open-ended tasks. These findings highlight latent continuous reasoning as a
promising direction for advancing LMMs beyond language-bound CoT, offering a
scalable framework for human-like reflective multimodal inference. Code is

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems built on Vision Language Models (VLMs)
have shown significant promise, yet their reliance on autoregressive
architectures introduces some limitations for real-world applications. The
sequential, token-by-token generation process of these models results in high
inference latency and cannot perform bidirectional reasoning, making them
unsuitable for dynamic, safety-critical environments. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce ViLaD, a novel Large Vision Language Diffusion (LVLD)
framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that represents a paradigm shift.
ViLaD leverages a masked diffusion model that enables parallel generation of
entire driving decision sequences, significantly reducing computational
latency. Moreover, its architecture supports bidirectional reasoning, allowing
the model to consider both past and future simultaneously, and supports
progressive easy-first generation to iteratively improve decision quality. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, where ViLaD
outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive VLM baselines in both planning
accuracy and inference speed, while achieving a near-zero failure rate.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the framework's practical viability through a
real-world deployment on an autonomous vehicle for an interactive parking task,
confirming its effectiveness and soundness for practical applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have introduced a
paradigm shift for Image Quality Assessment (IQA) from unexplainable image
quality scoring to explainable IQA, demonstrating practical applications like
quality control and optimization guidance. However, current explainable IQA
methods not only inadequately use the same distortion criteria to evaluate both
User-Generated Content (UGC) and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) images, but also
lack detailed quality analysis for monitoring image quality and guiding image
restoration. In this study, we establish the first large-scale Visual
Distortion Assessment Instruction Tuning Dataset for UGC images, termed
ViDA-UGC, which comprises 11K images with fine-grained quality grounding,
detailed quality perception, and reasoning quality description data. This
dataset is constructed through a distortion-oriented pipeline, which involves
human subject annotation and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) assessment framework.
This framework guides GPT-4o to generate quality descriptions by identifying
and analyzing UGC distortions, which helps capturing rich low-level visual
features that inherently correlate with distortion patterns. Moreover, we
carefully select 476 images with corresponding 6,149 question answer pairs from
ViDA-UGC and invite a professional team to ensure the accuracy and quality of
GPT-generated information. The selected and revised data further contribute to
the first UGC distortion assessment benchmark, termed ViDA-UGC-Bench.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ViDA-UGC and CoT
framework for consistently enhancing various image quality analysis abilities
across multiple base MLLMs on ViDA-UGC-Bench and Q-Bench, even surpassing
GPT-4o.

Abstract: Optical motion capture is a foundational technology driving advancements in
cutting-edge fields such as virtual reality and film production. However,
system performance suffers severely under large-scale marker occlusions common
in real-world applications. An in-depth analysis identifies two primary
limitations of current models: (i) the lack of training datasets accurately
reflecting realistic marker occlusion patterns, and (ii) the absence of
training strategies designed to capture long-range dependencies among markers.
To tackle these challenges, we introduce the CMU-Occlu dataset, which
incorporates ray tracing techniques to realistically simulate practical marker
occlusion patterns. Furthermore, we propose OpenMoCap, a novel motion-solving
model designed specifically for robust motion capture in environments with
significant occlusions. Leveraging a marker-joint chain inference mechanism,
OpenMoCap enables simultaneous optimization and construction of deep
constraints between markers and joints. Extensive comparative experiments
demonstrate that OpenMoCap consistently outperforms competing methods across
diverse scenarios, while the CMU-Occlu dataset opens the door for future
studies in robust motion solving. The proposed OpenMoCap is integrated into the

Abstract: Pursuing a continuous visual representation that offers flexible frequency

often rely on frequency guidance or complex neural network decoding, leading to
spectrum loss or slow rendering. To address these limitations, we propose
WIPES, a universal Wavelet-based vIsual PrimitivES for representing
multi-dimensional visual signals. Building on the spatial-frequency
localization advantages of wavelets, WIPES effectively captures both the
low-frequency "forest" and the high-frequency "trees." Additionally, we develop
a wavelet-based differentiable rasterizer to achieve fast visual rendering.
Experimental results on various visual tasks, including 2D image

WIPES, as a visual primitive, offers higher rendering quality and faster
inference than INR-based methods, and outperforms Gaussian-based

Abstract: Creative image in advertising is the heart and soul of e-commerce platform.
An eye-catching creative image can enhance the shopping experience for users,

advent of AIGC technology, advertisers can produce large quantities of creative
images at minimal cost. However, they struggle to assess the creative quality

  In this work, we propose the first paradigm for explainable creative

our approach integrates the assessment and selection of creative images into a
natural language generation task. To facilitate this research, we construct
CreativePair, the first comparative reasoning-induced creative dataset
featuring 8k annotated image pairs, with each sample including a label

supervised fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT-SFT) and Group Relative

evaluate and select creative images accurately. Both offline and online

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-time

demand fast and reliable responses based on accurate perception. To meet these
requirements, existing systems commonly employ cloud-edge collaborative
architectures, such as partitioned Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or task
offloading strategies between Large and Small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs).
However, these methods fail to accommodate cloud latency fluctuations and
overlook the full potential of delayed but accurate LVLM responses. In this
work, we propose a novel cloud-edge collaborative paradigm for VLMs, termed
Context Transfer, which treats the delayed outputs of LVLMs as historical
context to provide real-time guidance for SVLMs inference. Based on this
paradigm, we design SpotVLM, which incorporates both context replacement and
visual focus modules to refine historical textual input and enhance visual
grounding consistency. Extensive experiments on three real-time vision tasks
across four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
The new paradigm lays the groundwork for more effective and latency-aware
collaboration strategies in future VLM systems.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced (CE) T1-weighted MRI is central to neuro-oncologic
diagnosis but requires gadolinium-based agents, which add cost and scan time,
raise environmental concerns, and may pose risks to patients. In this work, we
propose a two-stage Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) pipeline for
synthesizing volumetric CE brain MRI from non-contrast inputs. First, a
patch-based 3D U-Net predicts the voxel-wise posterior mean (minimizing MSE).
Then, this initial estimate is refined by a time-conditioned 3D rectified flow
to incorporate realistic textures without compromising structural fidelity. We
train this model on a multi-institutional collection of paired pre- and
post-contrast T1w volumes (BraTS 2023-2025). On a held-out test set of 360
diverse volumes, our best refined outputs achieve an axial FID of $12.46$ and
KID of $0.007$ ($\sim 68.7\%$ lower FID than the posterior mean) while
maintaining low volumetric MSE of $0.057$ ($\sim 27\%$ higher than the
posterior mean). Qualitative comparisons confirm that our method restores
lesion margins and vascular details realistically, effectively navigating the
perception-distortion trade-off for clinical deployment.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to adapt a source pre-trained
model to continually changing target domains during inference. As a fundamental
principle, an ideal CTTA method should rapidly adapt to new domains
(exploration) while retaining and exploiting knowledge from previously
encountered domains to handle similar domains in the future. Despite
significant advances, balancing exploration and exploitation in CTTA is still
challenging: 1) Existing methods focus on adjusting predictions based on
deep-layer outputs of neural networks. However, domain shifts typically affect
shallow features, which are inefficient to be adjusted from deep predictions,
leading to dilatory exploration; 2) A single model inevitably forgets knowledge
of previous domains during the exploration, making it incapable of exploiting
historical knowledge to handle similar future domains. To address these
challenges, this paper proposes a mean teacher framework that strikes an
appropriate Balance between Exploration and Exploitation (BEE) during the CTTA
process. For the former challenge, we introduce a Multi-level Consistency
Regularization (MCR) loss that aligns the intermediate features of the student
and teacher models, accelerating adaptation to the current domain. For the
latter challenge, we employ a Complementary Anchor Replay (CAR) mechanism to
reuse historical checkpoints (anchors), recovering complementary knowledge for
diverse domains. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness
for CTTA tasks.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of dynamic crowds in large scenes has become increasingly
important for applications such as city surveillance and crowd analysis.
However, current works attempt to reconstruct 3D crowds from a static image,
causing a lack of temporal consistency and inability to alleviate the typical
impact caused by occlusions. In this paper, we propose DyCrowd, the first
framework for spatio-temporally consistent 3D reconstruction of hundreds of
individuals' poses, positions and shapes from a large-scene video. We design a
coarse-to-fine group-guided motion optimization strategy for occlusion-robust
crowd reconstruction in large scenes. To address temporal instability and
severe occlusions, we further incorporate a VAE (Variational Autoencoder)-based
human motion prior along with a segment-level group-guided optimization. The
core of our strategy leverages collective crowd behavior to address long-term
dynamic occlusions. By jointly optimizing the motion sequences of individuals
with similar motion segments and combining this with the proposed Asynchronous
Motion Consistency (AMC) loss, we enable high-quality unoccluded motion
segments to guide the motion recovery of occluded ones, ensuring robust and
plausible motion recovery even in the presence of temporal desynchronization
and rhythmic inconsistencies. Additionally, in order to fill the gap of no
existing well-annotated large-scene video dataset, we contribute a virtual
benchmark dataset, VirtualCrowd, for evaluating dynamic crowd reconstruction
from large-scene videos. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in the large-scene dynamic crowd
reconstruction task. The code and dataset will be available for research

appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically
targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our
approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB
completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to
provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with
occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions.
The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the
second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To
further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features
derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP
encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder
fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a
known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent
space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances
even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in
both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our
approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as
2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly
available.

Abstract: W\"olfflin's five principles offer a structured approach to analyzing
stylistic variations for formal analysis. However, no existing metric
effectively predicts all five principles in visual art. Computationally
evaluating the visual aspects of a painting requires a metric that can
interpret key elements such as color, composition, and thematic choices. Recent
advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated their ability
to evaluate abstract image attributes, making them promising candidates for
this task. In this work, we investigate whether CLIP, pre-trained on
large-scale data, can understand and predict W\"olfflin's principles. Our
findings indicate that it does not inherently capture such nuanced stylistic
elements. To address this, we fine-tune CLIP on annotated datasets of real art
images to predict a score for each principle. We evaluate our model, WP-CLIP,
on GAN-generated paintings and the Pandora-18K art dataset, demonstrating its
ability to generalize across diverse artistic styles. Our results highlight the
potential of VLMs for automated art analysis.

Abstract: Despite their success, current training pipelines for reasoning VLMs focus on
a limited range of tasks, such as mathematical and logical reasoning. As a
result, these models face difficulties in generalizing their reasoning
capabilities to a wide range of domains, primarily due to the scarcity of
readily available and verifiable reward data beyond these narrowly defined
areas. Moreover, integrating data from multiple domains is challenging, as the
compatibility between domain-specific datasets remains uncertain. To address
these limitations, we build a comprehensive RL-ready visual reasoning dataset
from 46 data sources across 8 dimensions, covering a wide range of tasks such
as infographic, mathematical, spatial, cross-image, graphic user interface,
medical, common sense and general science. We propose an influence function
based data selection and difficulty based filtering strategy to identify
high-quality training samples from this dataset. Subsequently, we train the
VLM, referred to as Vision-G1, using multi-round RL with a data curriculum to
iteratively improve its visual reasoning capabilities. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various visual reasoning benchmarks,
outperforming similar-sized VLMs and even proprietary models like GPT-4o and
Gemini-1.5 Flash. The model, code and dataset are publicly available at

Abstract: Multi-UAV collaborative 3D detection enables accurate and robust perception
by fusing multi-view observations from aerial platforms, offering significant
advantages in coverage and occlusion handling, while posing new challenges for
computation on resource-constrained UAV platforms. In this paper, we present
AdaBEV, a novel framework that learns adaptive instance-aware BEV
representations through a refine-and-contrast paradigm. Unlike existing methods
that treat all BEV grids equally, AdaBEV introduces a Box-Guided Refinement
Module (BG-RM) and an Instance-Background Contrastive Learning (IBCL) to
enhance semantic awareness and feature discriminability. BG-RM refines only BEV
grids associated with foreground instances using 2D supervision and spatial
subdivision, while IBCL promotes stronger separation between foreground and
background features via contrastive learning in BEV space. Extensive
experiments on the Air-Co-Pred dataset demonstrate that AdaBEV achieves
superior accuracy-computation trade-offs across model scales, outperforming
other state-of-the-art methods at low resolutions and approaching upper bound
performance while maintaining low-resolution BEV inputs and negligible
overhead.

Abstract: Test-time Adaptation (TTA) poses a challenge, requiring models to dynamically

particularly emphasized in real-world driving scenes, where weather domain
shifts occur frequently. To address such dynamic changes, our proposed method,
TTA-DAME, leverages source domain data augmentation into target domains.
Additionally, we introduce a domain discriminator and a specialized domain
detector to mitigate drastic domain shifts, especially from daytime to
nighttime conditions. To further improve adaptability, we train multiple
detectors and consolidate their predictions through Non-Maximum Suppression
(NMS). Our empirical validation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method,

Abstract: Class-incremental with repetition (CIR), where previously trained classes
repeatedly introduced in future tasks, is a more realistic scenario than the
traditional class incremental setup, which assumes that each task contains
unseen classes. CIR assumes that we can easily access abundant unlabeled data
from external sources, such as the Internet. Therefore, we propose two
components that efficiently use the unlabeled data to ensure the high stability
and the plasticity of models trained in CIR setup. First, we introduce
multi-level knowledge distillation (MLKD) that distills knowledge from multiple
previous models across multiple perspectives, including features and logits, so
the model can maintain much various previous knowledge. Moreover, we implement
dynamic self-supervised loss (SSL) to utilize the unlabeled data that
accelerates the learning of new classes, while dynamic weighting of SSL keeps
the focus of training to the primary task. Both of our proposed components
significantly improve the performance in CIR setup, achieving 2nd place in the
CVPR 5th CLVISION Challenge.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles often have varying camera sensor setups, which is
inevitable due to restricted placement options for different vehicle types.
Training a perception model on one particular setup and evaluating it on a new,
different sensor setup reveals the so-called cross-sensor domain gap, typically
leading to a degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the impact
of the cross-sensor domain gap on state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. To this
end, we introduce CamShift, a dataset inspired by nuScenes and created in CARLA
to specifically simulate the domain gap between subcompact vehicles and sport
utility vehicles (SUVs). Using CamShift, we demonstrate significant
cross-sensor performance degradation, identify robustness dependencies on model
architecture, and propose a data-driven solution to mitigate the effect. On the
one hand, we show that model architectures based on a dense Bird's Eye View
(BEV) representation with backward projection, such as BEVFormer, are the most
robust against varying sensor configurations. On the other hand, we propose a
novel data-driven sensor adaptation pipeline based on neural rendering, which
can transform entire datasets to match different camera sensor setups. Applying
this approach improves performance across all investigated 3D object detectors,
mitigating the cross-sensor domain gap by a large margin and reducing the need
for new data collection by enabling efficient data reusability across vehicles
with different sensor setups. The CamShift dataset and the sensor adaptation
benchmark are available at https://dmholtz.github.io/camshift/.

Abstract: The proliferation of multimodal misinformation poses growing threats to
public discourse and societal trust. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have enabled recent progress in multimodal misinformation detection (MMD), the
rise of generative AI (GenAI) tools introduces a new challenge: GenAI-driven
news diversity, characterized by highly varied and complex content. We show
that this diversity induces multi-level drift, comprising (1) model-level
misperception drift, where stylistic variations disrupt a model's internal
reasoning, and (2) evidence-level drift, where expression diversity degrades
the quality or relevance of retrieved external evidence. These drifts
significantly degrade the robustness of current LVLM-based MMD systems. To
systematically study this problem, we introduce DriftBench, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 16,000 news instances across six categories of
diversification. We design three evaluation tasks: (1) robustness of truth
verification under multi-level drift; (2) susceptibility to adversarial
evidence contamination generated by GenAI; and (3) analysis of reasoning
consistency across diverse inputs. Experiments with six state-of-the-art
LVLM-based detectors show substantial performance drops (average F1 -14.8%) and
increasingly unstable reasoning traces, with even more severe failures under
adversarial evidence injection. Our findings uncover fundamental
vulnerabilities in existing MMD systems and suggest an urgent need for more
resilient approaches in the GenAI era.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image generative models have shown remarkable ability to
synthesize diverse and high-quality images. However, it is still challenging to
directly apply these models for editing real images for two reasons. First, it
is difficult for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that accurately
describes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while existing models
can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically
alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions.
To address these challenges, we present Dual Contrastive Denoising Score, a
simple yet powerful framework that leverages the rich generative prior of
text-to-image diffusion models. Inspired by contrastive learning approaches for
unpaired image-to-image translation, we introduce a straightforward dual
contrastive loss within the proposed framework. Our approach utilizes the
extensive spatial information from the intermediate representations of the
self-attention layers in latent diffusion models without depending on auxiliary
networks. Our method achieves both flexible content modification and structure
preservation between input and output images, as well as zero-shot
image-to-image translation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
approach outperforms existing methods in real image editing while maintaining
the capability to directly utilize pretrained text-to-image diffusion models
without further training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in novel
view synthesis under dense-view settings. However, in sparse-view scenarios,
despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests
appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance
artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current
approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to
aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real
appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance
artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed
Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians,
i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple
renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians.
The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated
as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose
two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in
sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise
injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and
their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope
that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to
achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.

Abstract: Single image defocus deblurring aims to recover an all-in-focus image from a
defocus counterpart, where accurately modeling spatially varying blur kernels
remains a key challenge. Most existing methods rely on spatial features for
kernel estimation, but their performance degrades in severely blurry regions
where local high-frequency details are missing. To address this, we propose a
Frequency-Driven Inverse Kernel Prediction network (FDIKP) that incorporates
frequency-domain representations to enhance structural identifiability in
kernel modeling. Given the superior discriminative capability of the frequency
domain for blur modeling, we design a Dual-Branch Inverse Kernel Prediction
(DIKP) strategy that improves the accuracy of kernel estimation while
maintaining stability. Moreover, considering the limited number of predicted
inverse kernels, we introduce a Position Adaptive Convolution (PAC) to enhance
the adaptability of the deconvolution process. Finally, we propose a
Dual-Domain Scale Recurrent Module (DSRM) to fuse deconvolution results and
progressively improve deblurring quality from coarse to fine. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches. Code

Abstract: Image set classification (ISC), which can be viewed as a task of comparing
similarities between sets consisting of unordered heterogeneous images with
variable quantities and qualities, has attracted growing research attention in
recent years. How to learn effective feature representations and how to explore
the similarities between different image sets are two key yet challenging
issues in this field. However, existing traditional ISC methods classify image
sets based on raw pixel features, ignoring the importance of feature learning.
Existing deep ISC methods can learn deep features, but they fail to adaptively
adjust the features when measuring set distances, resulting in limited
performance in few-shot ISC. To address the above issues, this paper combines
traditional ISC methods with deep models and proposes a novel few-shot ISC
approach called Deep Class-specific Collaborative Representation (DCSCR)
network to simultaneously learn the frame- and concept-level feature
representations of each image set and the distance similarities between
different sets. Specifically, DCSCR consists of a fully convolutional deep
feature extractor module, a global feature learning module, and a
class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module. The
deep feature extractor and global feature learning modules are used to learn
(local and global) frame-level feature representations, while the
class-specific collaborative representation-based metric learning module is
exploit to adaptively learn the concept-level feature representation of each
image set and thus obtain the distance similarities between different sets by
developing a new CSCR-based contrastive loss function. Extensive experiments on
several well-known few-shot ISC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method compared with some state-of-the-art image set classification
algorithms.

Abstract: Shadow removal aims to restore images that are partially degraded by shadows,
where the degradation is spatially localized and non-uniform. Unlike general
restoration tasks that assume global degradation, shadow removal can leverage
abundant information from non-shadow regions for guidance. However, the
transformation required to correct shadowed areas often differs significantly
from that of well-lit regions, making it challenging to apply uniform
correction strategies. This necessitates the effective integration of non-local
contextual cues and adaptive modeling of region-specific transformations. To
this end, we propose a novel Mamba-based network featuring dual-scale fusion
and dual-path scanning to selectively propagate contextual information based on
transformation similarity across regions. Specifically, the proposed Dual-Scale
Fusion Mamba Block (DFMB) enhances multi-scale feature representation by fusing
original features with low-resolution features, effectively reducing boundary
artifacts. The Dual-Path Mamba Group (DPMG) captures global features via
horizontal scanning and incorporates a mask-aware adaptive scanning strategy,
which improves structural continuity and fine-grained region modeling.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches on shadow removal benchmarks.

fine-tuned to predict nine image properties (e.g., presence of contrast,
projection angle, motion artefact severity). Separate classifiers were trained
on an annotated dataset containing $1,758$ fluoroscopic MinIPs. The model
achieved excellent performance on all labels, with ROC-AUC ranging from $0.91$
to $0.98$, and precision ranging from $0.70$ to $1.00$. The ability of
CLAIRE-DSA to identify suitable images was evaluated on a segmentation task by
filtering poor quality images and comparing segmentation performance on
filtered and unfiltered datasets. Segmentation success rate increased from
$42%$ to $69%$, $p < 0.001$. CLAIRE-DSA demonstrates strong potential as an
automated tool for accurately classifying image properties in DSA series of

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Labeling Cadmium Zinc Telluride (CdZnTe) semiconductor images is challenging
due to the low-contrast defect boundaries, necessitating annotators to
cross-reference multiple views. These views share a single ground truth (GT),
forming a unique ``many-to-one'' relationship. This characteristic renders
advanced semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) methods suboptimal, as
they are generally limited by a ``one-to-one'' relationship, where each image
is independently associated with its GT. Such limitation may lead to error
accumulation in low-contrast regions, further exacerbating confirmation bias.
To address this issue, we revisit the SSS pipeline from a group-oriented
perspective and propose a human-inspired solution: the Intra-group Consistency
Augmentation Framework (ICAF). First, we experimentally validate the inherent
consistency constraints within CdZnTe groups, establishing a group-oriented
baseline using the Intra-group View Sampling (IVS). Building on this insight,
we introduce the Pseudo-label Correction Network (PCN) to enhance consistency
representation, which consists of two key modules. The View Augmentation Module
(VAM) improves boundary details by dynamically synthesizing a boundary-aware
view through the aggregation of multiple views. In the View Correction Module
(VCM), this synthesized view is paired with other views for information
interaction, effectively emphasizing salient regions while minimizing noise.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution for CdZnTe
materials. Leveraging DeepLabV3+ with a ResNet-101 backbone as our segmentation
model, we achieve a 70.6\% mIoU on the CdZnTe dataset using only 2
group-annotated data (5\textperthousand). The code is available at

Abstract: As a key research direction in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT),
UAV-based multi-object tracking has significant application value in the
analysis and understanding of urban intelligent transportation systems.
However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale
variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely
hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed
at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex
urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the
detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism.
The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of
trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism.
The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors
to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly
improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments.
Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical
trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks,
effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the
UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant
improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators,
highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack
is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with
existing trackers to further enhance performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have enabled exciting progress in
image style transfer. However, several key issues remain. For example, existing
methods still struggle to accurately match styles. They are often limited in
the number of style images that can be used. Furthermore, they tend to entangle
content and style in undesired ways. To address this, we propose leveraging
multiple style images which helps better represent style features and prevent
content leaking from the style images. We design a method that leverages both
image prompt adapters and statistical alignment of the features during the
denoising process. With this, our approach is designed such that it can
intervene both at the cross-attention and the self-attention layers of the
denoising UNet. For the statistical alignment, we employ clustering to distill
a small representative set of attention features from the large number of
attention values extracted from the style samples. As demonstrated in our
experimental section, the resulting method achieves state-of-the-art results
for stylization.

Abstract: Transportation influence health by shaping exposure to physical activity, air

behaviours is scarce, particularly at a global scale.Street view imagery, such
as Google Street View (GSV), combined with computer vision, is a valuable
resource for efficiently capturing travel behaviour data.This study
demonstrates a novel approach using deep learning on street view images to
estimate cycling and motorcycling levels across diverse cities worldwide.We
utilized data from 185 global cities.The data on mode shares of cycling and
motorcycling estimated using travel surveys or censuses.We used GSV images to
detect cycles and motorcycles in sampled locations, using 8000 images per
city.The YOLOv4 model, fine-tuned using images from six cities, achieved a mean
average precision of 89% for detecting cycles and motorcycles in GSV images.A
global prediction model was developed using beta regression with city-level
mode shares as outcome, with log transformed explanatory variables of counts of
GSV-detected images with cycles and motorcycles, while controlling for
population density.We found strong correlations between GSV motorcycle counts
and motorcycle mode share (0.78) and moderate correlations between GSV cycle
counts and cycling mode share (0.51).Beta regression models predicted mode
shares with $R^2$ values of 0.614 for cycling and 0.612 for motorcycling,
achieving median absolute errors (MDAE) of 1.3% and 1.4%,
respectively.Scatterplots demonstrated consistent prediction accuracy, though
cities like Utrecht and Cali were outliers.The model was applied to 60 cities
globally for which we didn't have recent mode share data.We provided estimates
for some cities in the Middle East, Latin America and East Asia.With computer
vision, GSV images capture travel modes and activity, providing insights
alongside traditional data sources.

Abstract: We present an application of computer vision methods to classify the light
curves of eclipsing binaries (EB). We have used pre-trained models based on
convolutional neural networks ($\textit{ResNet50}$) and vision transformers
($\textit{vit\_base\_patch16\_224}$), which were fine-tuned on images created
from synthetic datasets. To improve model generalisation and reduce
overfitting, we developed a novel image representation by transforming
phase-folded light curves into polar coordinates combined with hexbin
visualisation. Our hierarchical approach in the first stage classifies systems
into detached and overcontact types, and in the second stage identifies the
presence or absence of spots. The binary classification models achieved high
accuracy ($>96\%$) on validation data across multiple passbands (Gaia~$G$, $I$,
and $TESS$) and demonstrated strong performance ($>94\%$, up to $100\%$ for
$TESS$) when tested on extensive observational data from the OGLE, DEBCat, and
WUMaCat catalogues. While the primary binary classification was highly
successful, the secondary task of automated spot detection performed poorly,
revealing a significant limitation of our models for identifying subtle
photometric features. This study highlights the potential of computer vision
for EB morphological classification in large-scale surveys, but underscores the
need for further research into robust, automated spot detection.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to image generation by decomposing an image into
a structured sequence, where each element in the sequence shares the same
spatial resolution but differs in the number of unique tokens used, capturing
different level of visual granularity. Image generation is carried out through
our newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which
generates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and
progressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured
manner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation
that offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple
granularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image
generation on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared
to the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30
-> 3.03, 2.57 ->2.44, 2.09 -> 2.06). We also conduct extensive analysis to
showcase the capability and potential of the NVG framework. Our code and models
will be released.

Abstract: Continuous and reliable underwater monitoring is essential for assessing
marine biodiversity, detecting ecological changes and supporting autonomous
exploration in aquatic environments. Underwater monitoring platforms rely on
mainly visual data for marine biodiversity analysis, ecological assessment and
autonomous exploration. However, underwater environments present significant
challenges due to light scattering, absorption and turbidity, which degrade
image clarity and distort colour information, which makes accurate observation
difficult. To address these challenges, we propose DEEP-SEA, a novel deep
learning-based underwater image restoration model to enhance both low- and
high-frequency information while preserving spatial structures. The proposed
Dual-Frequency Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial and Frequency Modulator aims to
adaptively refine feature representations in frequency domains and
simultaneously spatial information for better structural preservation. Our
comprehensive experiments on EUVP and LSUI datasets demonstrate the superiority
over the state of the art in restoring fine-grained image detail and structural
consistency. By effectively mitigating underwater visual degradation, DEEP-SEA
has the potential to improve the reliability of underwater monitoring platforms
for more accurate ecological observation, species identification and autonomous
navigation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on natural image and language data,
such as CLIP, have exhibited significant potential in few-shot image
recognition tasks, leading to development of various efficient transfer
learning methods. These methods exploit inherent pre-learned knowledge in VLMs
and have achieved strong performance on standard image datasets. However, their
effectiveness is often limited when confronted with cross-domain tasks where
imaging domains differ from natural images. To address this limitation, we
propose Consistency-guided Multi-view Collaborative Optimization (CoMuCo), a
novel fine-tuning strategy for VLMs. This strategy employs two functionally
complementary expert modules to extract multi-view features, while
incorporating prior knowledge-based consistency constraints and information
geometry-based consensus mechanisms to enhance the robustness of feature
learning. Additionally, a new cross-domain few-shot benchmark is established to
help comprehensively evaluate methods on imaging domains distinct from natural
images. Extensive empirical evaluations on both existing and newly proposed
benchmarks suggest CoMuCo consistently outperforms current methods in few-shot
tasks. The code and benchmark will be released.

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown remarkable
potential in few-shot image classification and led to numerous effective
transfer learning strategies. These methods leverage the pretrained knowledge
of VLMs to enable effective domain adaptation while mitigating overfitting
through parameter-efficient tuning or instance-based consistency constraints.
However, such regularizations often neglect the geometric structure of data
distribution, which may lead to distortion of the overall semantic
representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel fine-tuning
method, Manifold-Preserving and Sculpting Tuning (MPS-Tuning). Regarding the
data distribution in feature space as a semantic manifold, MPS-Tuning
explicitly constrains the intrinsic geometry of this manifold while further
sculpting it to enhance class separability. Specifically, MPS-Tuning preserves
both macroscopic and microscopic topological structures of the original
manifold by aligning Gram matrices of features before and after fine-tuning.
Theoretically, this constraint is shown to approximate an upper bound of the
Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Furthermore, features from the image and text
modalities are paired, and pairwise similarities are optimized to enhance the
manifold's class discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MPS-Tuning significantly improves model performance while effectively
preserving the structure of the semantic manifold. The code will be released.

Abstract: Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in modern diffusion
models for enhancing sample quality and prompt adherence. However, through an
empirical analysis on Gaussian mixture modeling with a closed-form solution, we
observe a discrepancy between the suboptimal results produced by CFG and the
ground truth. The model's excessive reliance on these suboptimal predictions
often leads to semantic incoherence and low-quality outputs. To address this
issue, we first empirically demonstrate that the model's suboptimal predictions
can be effectively refined using sub-networks of the model itself. Building on
this insight, we propose S^2-Guidance, a novel method that leverages stochastic
block-dropping during the forward process to construct stochastic sub-networks,
effectively guiding the model away from potential low-quality predictions and
toward high-quality outputs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
on text-to-image and text-to-video generation tasks demonstrate that
S^2-Guidance delivers superior performance, consistently surpassing CFG and
other advanced guidance strategies. Our code will be released.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success but their large

involve complex iterative processes, specialized criteria, or struggle to
maintain sparsity effectively during training. We introduce ONG (One-shot
NMF-based Gradient Masking), a novel sparsification strategy that identifies
salient weight structures using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for
one-shot pruning at the outset of training. Subsequently, ONG employs a precise
gradient masking mechanism to ensure that only unpruned weights are updated,
strictly preserving the target sparsity throughout the training phase. We
integrate ONG into the BIMP comparative framework and evaluate it on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 with ResNet56, ResNet34, and ResNet18 against established stable
sparsification methods. Our experiments demonstrate ONG's ability to achieve
comparable or superior performance at various sparsity levels while maintaining
structural integrity post-pruning and offering a clear mechanism for targeting
desired sparsities.

Abstract: Generative modelling of entire CT volumes conditioned on clinical reports has

while preserving diagnostic signals. With the recent release of CT-RATE, a
large-scale collection of 3D CT volumes paired with their respective clinical
reports, training large text-conditioned CT volume generation models has become
achievable. In this work, we introduce CTFlow, a 0.5B latent flow matching
transformer model, conditioned on clinical reports. We leverage the A-VAE from
FLUX to define our latent space, and rely on the CT-Clip text encoder to encode
the clinical reports. To generate consistent whole CT volumes while keeping the
memory constraints tractable, we rely on a custom autoregressive approach,
where the model predicts the first sequence of slices of the volume from
text-only, and then relies on the previously generated sequence of slices and
the text, to predict the following sequence. We evaluate our results against
state-of-the-art generative CT model, and demonstrate the superiority of our
approach in terms of temporal coherence, image diversity and text-image
alignment, with FID, FVD, IS scores and CLIP score.

Abstract: Multi-modal methods based on camera and LiDAR sensors have garnered
significant attention in the field of 3D detection. However, many prevalent
works focus on single or partial stage fusion, leading to insufficient feature
extraction and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a
multi-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to
effectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic
information. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space
via a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the
representation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral
cross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and
pseudo points. The first sparse-to-distant (S2D) branch utilizes an
encoder-decoder structure to reinforce the representation of sparse LiDAR
points. The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to
mitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D
convolution processes. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative voxel-point
aware fine grained pooling module, which captures the spatial information from
LiDAR points and textural information from pseudo points in the proposal
refinement stage. To achieve more precise refinement during iteration, an
intersection over union (IoU) joint prediction branch integrated with a novel
proposals generation technique is designed to preserve the bounding boxes with
both high IoU and classification scores. Extensive experiments show the
superior performance of our method on the KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets.

Abstract: Layout-guided text-to-image models offer greater control over the generation
process by explicitly conditioning image synthesis on the spatial arrangement
of elements. As a result, their adoption has increased in many computer vision
applications, ranging from content creation to synthetic data generation. A
critical challenge is achieving precise alignment between the image, textual
prompt, and layout, ensuring semantic fidelity and spatial accuracy. Although
recent benchmarks assess text alignment, layout alignment remains overlooked,
and no existing benchmark jointly evaluates both. This gap limits the ability
to evaluate a model's spatial fidelity, which is crucial when using
layout-guided generation for synthetic data, as errors can introduce noise and
degrade data quality. In this work, we introduce 7Bench, the first benchmark to
assess both semantic and spatial alignment in layout-guided text-to-image
generation. It features text-and-layout pairs spanning seven challenging
scenarios, investigating object generation, color fidelity, attribute
recognition, inter-object relationships, and spatial control. We propose an
evaluation protocol that builds on existing frameworks by incorporating the
layout alignment score to assess spatial accuracy. Using 7Bench, we evaluate
several state-of-the-art diffusion models, uncovering their respective
strengths and limitations across diverse alignment tasks. The benchmark is

Abstract: Current anomaly detection methods primarily focus on low-resolution
scenarios. For high-resolution images, conventional downsampling often results
in missed detections of subtle anomalous regions due to the loss of
fine-grained discriminative information. Despite some progress, recent studies
have attempted to improve detection resolution by employing lightweight
networks or using simple image tiling and ensemble methods. However, these
approaches still struggle to meet the practical demands of industrial scenarios
in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency. To address the above issues, we
propose HiAD, a general framework for high-resolution anomaly detection. HiAD
is capable of detecting anomalous regions of varying sizes in high-resolution
images under limited computational resources. Specifically, HiAD employs a
dual-branch architecture that integrates anomaly cues across different scales
to comprehensively capture both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Furthermore,
it incorporates a multi-resolution feature fusion strategy to tackle the
challenges posed by fine-grained texture variations in high-resolution images.
To enhance both adaptability and efficiency, HiAD utilizes a detector pool in
conjunction with various detector assignment strategies, enabling detectors to
be adaptively assigned based on patch features, ensuring detection performance
while effectively controlling computational costs. We conduct extensive
experiments on our specifically constructed high-resolution anomaly detection
benchmarks, including MVTec-HD, VisA-HD, and the real-world benchmark
RealIAD-HD, demonstrating the superior performance of HiAD. The code is

Abstract: In incremental learning, enhancing the generality of knowledge is crucial for
adapting to dynamic data inputs. It can develop generalized representations or
more balanced decision boundaries, preventing the degradation of long-term
knowledge over time and thus mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Some emerging
incremental learning methods adopt an encoder-decoder architecture and have
achieved promising results. In the encoder-decoder achitecture, improving the
generalization capabilities of both the encoder and decoder is critical, as it
helps preserve previously learned knowledge while ensuring adaptability and
robustness to new, diverse data inputs. However, many existing continual
methods focus solely on enhancing one of the two components, which limits their
effectiveness in mitigating catastrophic forgetting. And these methods perform
even worse in small-memory scenarios, where only a limited number of historical
samples can be stored. To mitigate this limitation, we introduces SEDEG, a
two-stage training framework for vision transformers (ViT), focusing on
sequentially improving the generality of both Decoder and Encoder. Initially,
SEDEG trains an ensembled encoder through feature boosting to learn generalized
representations, which subsequently enhance the decoder's generality and
balance the classifier. The next stage involves using knowledge distillation
(KD) strategies to compress the ensembled encoder and develop a new, more
generalized encoder. This involves using a balanced KD approach and feature KD
for effective knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three benchmark
datasets show SEDEG's superior performance, and ablation studies confirm the
efficacy of its components. The code is available at

manually on histological slides. Existing automated methods often miss sparse
bundles or require complex post-processing across consecutive sections,
limiting their flexibility and generalizability. We present a streamlined,
fully automated framework for fiber bundle segmentation in macaque tracer data,
based on a U-Net architecture with large patch sizes, foreground aware
sampling, and semisupervised pre-training. Our approach eliminates common
errors such as mislabeling terminals as bundles, improves detection of sparse
bundles by over 20% and reduces the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by 40% compared
to the state-of-the-art, all while enabling analysis of standalone slices. This
new framework will facilitate the automated analysis of anatomic tracing data
at a large scale, generating more ground-truth data that can be used to

Abstract: Video relighting is a challenging yet valuable task, aiming to replace the
background in videos while correspondingly adjusting the lighting in the
foreground with harmonious blending. During translation, it is essential to
preserve the original properties of the foreground, e.g., albedo, and propagate
consistent relighting among temporal frames. In this paper, we propose Lumen,
an end-to-end video relighting framework developed on large-scale video
generative models, receiving flexible textual description for instructing the
control of lighting and background. Considering the scarcity of high-qualified
paired videos with the same foreground in various lighting conditions, we
construct a large-scale dataset with a mixture of realistic and synthetic
videos. For the synthetic domain, benefiting from the abundant 3D assets in the
community, we leverage advanced 3D rendering engine to curate video pairs in
diverse environments. For the realistic domain, we adapt a HDR-based lighting
simulation to complement the lack of paired in-the-wild videos. Powered by the
aforementioned dataset, we design a joint training curriculum to effectively
unleash the strengths of each domain, i.e., the physical consistency in
synthetic videos, and the generalized domain distribution in realistic videos.
To implement this, we inject a domain-aware adapter into the model to decouple
the learning of relighting and domain appearance distribution. We construct a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate Lumen together with existing methods, from
the perspectives of foreground preservation and video consistency assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that Lumen effectively edit the input into
cinematic relighted videos with consistent lighting and strict foreground
preservation. Our project page: https://lumen-relight.github.io/

Abstract: Human action recognition is a crucial task for intelligent robotics,
particularly within the context of human-robot collaboration research. In
self-supervised skeleton-based action recognition, the mask-based
reconstruction paradigm learns the spatial structure and motion patterns of the
skeleton by masking joints and reconstructing the target from unlabeled data.
However, existing methods focus on a limited set of joints and low-order motion
patterns, limiting the model's ability to understand complex motion patterns.
To address this issue, we introduce MaskSem, a novel semantic-guided masking
method for learning 3D hybrid high-order motion representations. This novel
framework leverages Grad-CAM based on relative motion to guide the masking of
joints, which can be represented as the most semantically rich temporal
orgions. The semantic-guided masking process can encourage the model to explore
more discriminative features. Furthermore, we propose using hybrid high-order
motion as the reconstruction target, enabling the model to learn multi-order
motion patterns. Specifically, low-order motion velocity and high-order motion
acceleration are used together as the reconstruction target. This approach
offers a more comprehensive description of the dynamic motion process,
enhancing the model's understanding of motion patterns. Experiments on the
NTU60, NTU120, and PKU-MMD datasets show that MaskSem, combined with a vanilla
transformer, improves skeleton-based action recognition, making it more
suitable for applications in human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong
potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing
computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains
underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this
domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting
their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended
medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited
attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via
semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often
suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic
differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive
Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended
medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning
with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning
quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results
show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving
a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain
benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward
discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards
for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.

ToothFairy3 dataset (63 CBCT scans) with 5-fold cross-validation. Key
preprocessing steps included image resampling to 0.6 mm isotropic resolution
and intensity clipping. We applied an ensemble fusion using Multi-Label STAPLE
on the 5-fold predictions to infer a Phase 1 segmentation and then conducted
tight cropping around the easily segmented Phase 1 mandible to perform Phase 2
segmentation on the smaller nerve structures. Our method achieved an average
Dice of 0.87 on the ToothFairy3 challenge out-of-sample validation set. This

Abstract: Gaze communication plays a crucial role in daily social interactions.
Quantifying this behavior can help in human-computer interaction and digital
phenotyping. While end-to-end models exist for gaze target detection, they only
utilize a single decoder to simultaneously localize human heads and predict
their corresponding gaze (e.g., 2D points or heatmap) in a scene. This
multitask learning approach generates a unified and entangled representation
for human head localization and gaze location prediction. Herein, we propose
GazeDETR, a novel end-to-end architecture with two disentangled decoders that
individually learn unique representations and effectively utilize coherent
attentive fields for each subtask. More specifically, we demonstrate that its

Abstract: The computational demands of self-attention mechanisms pose a critical
challenge for transformer-based video generation, particularly in synthesizing
ultra-long sequences. Current approaches, such as factorized attention and
fixed sparse patterns, fail to fully exploit the inherent spatio-temporal
redundancies in video data. Through systematic analysis of video diffusion
transformers (DiT), we uncover a key insight: Attention matrices exhibit
structured, yet heterogeneous sparsity patterns, where specialized heads
dynamically attend to distinct spatiotemporal regions (e.g., local pattern,
cross-shaped pattern, or global pattern). Existing sparse attention methods
either impose rigid constraints or introduce significant overhead, limiting
their effectiveness. To address this, we propose Compact Attention, a
hardware-aware acceleration framework featuring three innovations: 1) Adaptive
tiling strategies that approximate diverse spatial interaction patterns via
dynamic tile grouping, 2) Temporally varying windows that adjust sparsity
levels based on frame proximity, and 3) An automated configuration search
algorithm that optimizes sparse patterns while preserving critical attention
pathways. Our method achieves 1.6~2.5x acceleration in attention computation on
single-GPU setups while maintaining comparable visual quality with
full-attention baselines. This work provides a principled approach to unlocking
efficient long-form video generation through structured sparsity exploitation.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Zero-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) typically optimises the
architecture search process by exploiting the network or gradient properties at
initialisation through zero-cost proxies. The existing proxies often rely on
labelled data, which is usually unavailable in real-world settings.
Furthermore, the majority of the current methods focus either on optimising the
convergence and generalisation attributes or solely on the expressivity of the
network architectures. To address both limitations, we first demonstrate how
channel collinearity affects the convergence and generalisation properties of a
neural network. Then, by incorporating the convergence, generalisation and
expressivity in one approach, we propose a zero-cost proxy that omits the
requirement of labelled data for its computation. In particular, we leverage
the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the neural network layer features and
the extrinsic curvature of the network output to design our proxy. %As a
result, the proposed proxy is formulated as the simplified harmonic mean of the
logarithms of two key components: the sum of the inverse of the feature
condition number and the extrinsic curvature of the network output. Our
approach enables accurate prediction of network performance on test data using
only a single label-free data sample. Our extensive evaluation includes a total
of six experiments, including the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) search
space, i.e. DARTS and the Transformer search space, i.e. AutoFormer. The
proposed proxy demonstrates a superior performance on multiple correlation
benchmarks, including NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201, and
TransNAS-Bench-101-micro; as well as on the NAS task within the DARTS and the
AutoFormer search space, all while being notably efficient. The code is

Abstract: The development of smart cities has led to the generation of massive amounts
of multi-modal data in the context of a range of tasks that enable a
comprehensive monitoring of the smart city infrastructure and services. This
paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object
tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally,
MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection,
modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation.
Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities,
laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a
discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and
annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on
different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the
auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental
configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth
(D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part
of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an
omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT),
covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we
discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always
guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of
information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is
beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the
distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets,
revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal
categories when compared with RGB datasets.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Open set recognition (OSR) and continual learning are two critical challenges
in machine learning, focusing respectively on detecting novel classes at
inference time and updating models to incorporate the new classes. While many
recent approaches have addressed these problems, particularly OSR, by
heuristically promoting feature diversity, few studies have directly examined
the role that feature diversity plays in tackling them. In this work, we
provide empirical evidence that enhancing feature diversity improves the
recognition of open set samples. Moreover, increased feature diversity also
facilitates both the retention of previously learned data and the integration
of new data in continual learning. We hope our findings can inspire further
research into both practical methods and theoretical understanding in these
domains.

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to

Yet transmitting dense Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps can overwhelm the
bandwidth available for inter-vehicle communication. We present SlimComm, a
communication-efficient framework that integrates 4D radar Doppler with a
query-driven sparse scheme. SlimComm builds a motion-centric dynamic map to
distinguish moving from static objects and generates two query types: (i)
reference queries on dynamic and high-confidence regions, and (ii) exploratory
queries probing occluded areas via a two-stage offset. Only query-specific BEV
features are exchanged and fused through multi-scale gated deformable
attention, reducing payload while preserving accuracy. For evaluation, we
release OPV2V-R and Adver-City-R, CARLA-based datasets with per-point Doppler
radar. SlimComm achieves up to 90% lower bandwidth than full-map sharing while
matching or surpassing prior baselines across varied traffic densities and
occlusions. Dataset and code will be available at: https://url.fzi.de/SlimComm.

Abstract: Recent advances in interactive video generations have demonstrated diffusion
model's potential as world models by capturing complex physical dynamics and
interactive behaviors. However, existing interactive world models depend on
bidirectional attention and lengthy inference steps, severely limiting
real-time performance. Consequently, they are hard to simulate real-world
dynamics, where outcomes must update instantaneously based on historical
context and current actions. To address this, we present Matrix-Game 2.0, an
interactive world model generates long videos on-the-fly via few-step
auto-regressive diffusion. Our framework consists of three key components: (1)
A scalable data production pipeline for Unreal Engine and GTA5 environments to
effectively produce massive amounts (about 1200 hours) of video data with
diverse interaction annotations; (2) An action injection module that enables
frame-level mouse and keyboard inputs as interactive conditions; (3) A few-step
distillation based on the casual architecture for real-time and streaming video
generation. Matrix Game 2.0 can generate high-quality minute-level videos
across diverse scenes at an ultra-fast speed of 25 FPS. We open-source our
model weights and codebase to advance research in interactive world modeling.

Abstract: While exocentric video synthesis has achieved great progress, egocentric
video generation remains largely underexplored, which requires modeling
first-person view content along with camera motion patterns induced by the
wearer's body movements. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of joint
egocentric video and human motion generation, characterized by two key
challenges: 1) Viewpoint Alignment: the camera trajectory in the generated
video must accurately align with the head trajectory derived from human motion;
2) Causal Interplay: the synthesized human motion must causally align with the
observed visual dynamics across adjacent video frames. To address these
challenges, we propose EgoTwin, a joint video-motion generation framework built
on the diffusion transformer architecture. Specifically, EgoTwin introduces a
head-centric motion representation that anchors the human motion to the head
joint and incorporates a cybernetics-inspired interaction mechanism that
explicitly captures the causal interplay between video and motion within
attention operations. For comprehensive evaluation, we curate a large-scale
real-world dataset of synchronized text-video-motion triplets and design novel
metrics to assess video-motion consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of the EgoTwin framework.

through stochastic training that learns center-invariant adaptations. The
framework utilizes multi-scale SSIM loss with frequency domain enhancement and
contrast-adaptive weighting for robust optimization. Comprehensive evaluation

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from images, for example, with 3D Gaussian splatting,
has made great progress. Rendering fidelity and speed are now ready even for
demanding virtual reality applications. However, the problem of assisting
humans in collecting the input images for these rendering algorithms has
received much less attention. High-quality view synthesis requires uniform and
dense view sampling. Unfortunately, these requirements are not easily addressed
by human camera operators, who are in a hurry, impatient, or lack understanding
of the scene structure and the photographic process. Existing approaches to
guide humans during image acquisition concentrate on single objects or neglect
view-dependent material characteristics. We propose a novel situated
visualization technique for scanning at multiple scales. During the scanning of
a scene, our method identifies important objects that need extended image
coverage to properly represent view-dependent appearance. To this end, we
leverage semantic segmentation and category identification, ranked by a
vision-language model. Spherical proxies are generated around highly ranked
objects to guide the user during scanning. Our results show superior
performance in real scenes compared to conventional view sampling strategies.

Abstract: Human shape editing enables controllable transformation of a person's body
shape, such as thin, muscular, or overweight, while preserving pose, identity,
clothing, and background. Unlike human pose editing, which has advanced
rapidly, shape editing remains relatively underexplored. Current approaches
typically rely on 3D morphable models or image warping, often introducing
unrealistic body proportions, texture distortions, and background
inconsistencies due to alignment errors and deformations. A key limitation is
the lack of large-scale, publicly available datasets for training and
evaluating body shape manipulation methods. In this work, we introduce the
first large-scale dataset of 18,573 images across 1523 subjects, specifically
designed for controlled human shape editing. It features diverse variations in
body shape, including fat, muscular and thin, captured under consistent
identity, clothing, and background conditions. Using this dataset, we propose
Odo, an end-to-end diffusion-based method that enables realistic and intuitive
body reshaping guided by simple semantic attributes. Our approach combines a
frozen UNet that preserves fine-grained appearance and background details from
the input image with a ControlNet that guides shape transformation using target
SMPL depth maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
prior approaches, achieving per-vertex reconstruction errors as low as 7.5mm,
significantly lower than the 13.6mm observed in baseline methods, while
producing realistic results that accurately match the desired target shapes.

Abstract: We propose a two-stage multimodal framework that enhances disease

leveraging the MIMIC-Eye dataset. In the first stage, we introduce a
gaze-guided contrastive learning architecture for disease classification. It
integrates visual features, clinical labels, bounding boxes, and radiologist
eye-tracking signals and is equipped with a novel multi-term gaze-attention
loss combining MSE, KL divergence, correlation, and center-of-mass alignment.
Incorporating fixations improves F1 score from 0.597 to 0.631 (+5.70%) and AUC
from 0.821 to 0.849 (+3.41%), while also improving precision and recall,
highlighting the effectiveness of gaze-informed attention supervision. In the
second stage, we present a modular report generation pipeline that extracts
confidence-weighted diagnostic keywords, maps them to anatomical regions using
a curated dictionary constructed from domain-specific priors, and generates
region-aligned sentences via structured prompts. This pipeline improves report
quality as measured by clinical keyword recall and ROUGE overlap. Our results
demonstrate that integrating gaze data improves both classification performance
and the interpretability of generated medical reports.

take into account the limited number of bona fide images. This work is one of
the first to propose a method for mimicking bona fide images by generating
synthetic versions of them using Stable Diffusion, which may help improve the
generalisation capabilities of the detector. Furthermore, the new images
generated are evaluated in a system trained from scratch and in a commercial
solution. The PAD system yields an interesting result, as it identifies our
images as bona fide, which has a positive impact on detection performance and
data restrictions.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RSVQA) presents unique challenges
in ensuring that model decisions are both understandable and grounded in visual
content. Current models often suffer from a lack of interpretability and
explainability, as well as from biases in dataset distributions that lead to
shortcut learning. In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing a novel
RSVQA dataset, Chessboard, designed to minimize biases through 3'123'253
questions and a balanced answer distribution. Each answer is linked to one or
more cells within the image, enabling fine-grained visual reasoning.
  Building on this dataset, we develop an explainable and interpretable model
called Checkmate that identifies the image cells most relevant to its
decisions. Through extensive experiments across multiple model architectures,
we show that our approach improves transparency and supports more trustworthy
decision-making in RSVQA systems.

Abstract: While supervised stereo matching and monocular depth estimation have advanced
significantly with learning-based algorithms, self-supervised methods using
stereo images as supervision signals have received relatively less focus and
require further investigation. A primary challenge arises from ambiguity
introduced during photometric reconstruction, particularly due to missing
corresponding pixels in ill-posed regions of the target view, such as
occlusions and out-of-frame areas. To address this and establish explicit
photometric correspondences, we propose DMS, a model-agnostic approach that
utilizes geometric priors from diffusion models to synthesize novel views along
the epipolar direction, guided by directional prompts. Specifically, we
finetune a Stable Diffusion model to simulate perspectives at key positions:
left-left view shifted from the left camera, right-right view shifted from the
right camera, along with an additional novel view between the left and right
cameras. These synthesized views supplement occluded pixels, enabling explicit
photometric reconstruction. Our proposed DMS is a cost-free, ''plug-and-play''
method that seamlessly enhances self-supervised stereo matching and monocular
depth estimation, and relies solely on unlabeled stereo image pairs for both
training and synthesizing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach, with up to 35% outlier reduction and state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

investigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a

conducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and
RT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of
coastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves
marginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\% IoU
(mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's
0.810 and 0.606, respectively. However, this minor performance gain is realized
at a significant computational cost; the RT-DETR-L model demonstrates a
substantially faster inference time of 20.1 ms versus 34.5 ms for the
RT-DETR-X. The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more
practical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its
superior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy. This research
provides valuable insights into the application of advanced Transformer-based
detectors for environmental conservation, highlighting the critical trade-offs

Abstract: We present visual action prompts, a unified action representation for

transferable visual dynamics across domains. Action-driven video generation
faces a precision-generality trade-off: existing methods using text, primitive
actions, or coarse masks offer generality but lack precision, while
agent-centric action signals provide precision at the cost of cross-domain
transferability. To balance action precision and dynamic transferability, we
propose to "render" actions into precise visual prompts as domain-agnostic
representations that preserve both geometric precision and cross-domain
adaptability for complex actions; specifically, we choose visual skeletons for
their generality and accessibility. We propose robust pipelines to construct
skeletons from two interaction-rich data sources - human-object interactions
(HOI) and dexterous robotic manipulation - enabling cross-domain training of
action-driven generative models. By integrating visual skeletons into
pretrained video generation models via lightweight fine-tuning, we enable
precise action control of complex interaction while preserving the learning of
cross-domain dynamics. Experiments on EgoVid, RT-1 and DROID demonstrate the

Abstract: This work studies the challenge of transfer animations between characters
whose skeletal topologies differ substantially. While many techniques have
advanced retargeting techniques in decades, transfer motions across diverse
topologies remains less-explored. The primary obstacle lies in the inherent
topological inconsistency between source and target skeletons, which restricts
the establishment of straightforward one-to-one bone correspondences. Besides,
the current lack of large-scale paired motion datasets spanning different
topological structures severely constrains the development of data-driven
approaches. To address these limitations, we introduce Motion2Motion, a novel,
training-free framework. Simply yet effectively, Motion2Motion works with only
one or a few example motions on the target skeleton, by accessing a sparse set
of bone correspondences between the source and target skeletons. Through
comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
Motion2Motion achieves efficient and reliable performance in both
similar-skeleton and cross-species skeleton transfer scenarios. The practical
utility of our approach is further evidenced by its successful integration in
downstream applications and user interfaces, highlighting its potential for
industrial applications. Code and data are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing complete and interactive 3D scenes remains a fundamental
challenge in computer vision and robotics, particularly due to persistent
object occlusions and limited sensor coverage. Multiview observations from a
single scene scan often fail to capture the full structural details. Existing
approaches typically rely on multi stage pipelines, such as segmentation,
background completion, and inpainting or require per-object dense scanning,
both of which are error-prone, and not easily scalable. We propose IGFuse, a
novel framework that reconstructs interactive Gaussian scene by fusing
observations from multiple scans, where natural object rearrangement between
captures reveal previously occluded regions. Our method constructs segmentation
aware Gaussian fields and enforces bi-directional photometric and semantic
consistency across scans. To handle spatial misalignments, we introduce a
pseudo-intermediate scene state for unified alignment, alongside collaborative
co-pruning strategies to refine geometry. IGFuse enables high fidelity
rendering and object level scene manipulation without dense observations or
complex pipelines. Extensive experiments validate the framework's strong
generalization to novel scene configurations, demonstrating its effectiveness

to alleviate the scarcity of 4D data, we construct 4DNeX-10M, a large-scale
dataset with high-quality 4D annotations generated using advanced
reconstruction approaches. 2) we introduce a unified 6D video representation
that jointly models RGB and XYZ sequences, facilitating structured learning of
both appearance and geometry. 3) we propose a set of simple yet effective
adaptation strategies to repurpose pretrained video diffusion models for 4D
modeling. 4DNeX produces high-quality dynamic point clouds that enable
novel-view video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4DNeX
outperforms existing 4D generation methods in efficiency and generalizability,
offering a scalable solution for image-to-4D modeling and laying the foundation
for generative 4D world models that simulate dynamic scene evolution.

This work\npresents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to\nexploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function.\nOur approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L)\nevaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on\n48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance\ncomputations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to\nconventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold\nmatches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5\ngray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical\nlogarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees\nsuitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical\ncomputational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without\ncompromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the\noriginal Otsu method."}

However, existing open-source\nmodels often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We\npresent Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially\nreduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated\ntraining recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters\nthat produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete\ntokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified\nautoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image\ntokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image\ntokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe\nover understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both\ncapabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,\nand is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich\nevaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from\nscaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer."}

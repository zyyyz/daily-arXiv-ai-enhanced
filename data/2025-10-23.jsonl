Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is\nessential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among\nthem, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach\npossible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a\nwarehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has\nlimitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is\nnecessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19\nwide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the\nlogistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera\ncoordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment\nbased on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle\ncameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly\nin the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from\neach camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image\ndistortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras.

However, the research community's progress remains constrained\nby the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets\nbuilt from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive\n400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is\nconstructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real\nphotographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K\nfrom previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and\ndiversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure\ncomprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content\npreservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring\nand careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables\nresearch into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized\nsubsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential\nediting, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a\n56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;\nand (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction\nrewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,\nhigh-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust\nfoundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided\nimage editing models."}

This paper\ncontributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of\ntheir sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,\nemphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing\nmetrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making\nflat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative\nsurface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled\nmethod to create composite metrics with better human alignment.

To\nscale unit test creation, we develop a pipeline for generating synthetic\ndocuments with diverse and challenging layouts, known ground-truth HTML source\ncode, and extracted test cases. We show that RL training on these test cases\nresults in state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, our English-language\nOCR benchmark, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table\nparsing, and multi-column layouts compared to previous versions.

Our\nvideos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,\nwith high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.\nITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity\ncharacteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in\ncurrent benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking\nmethods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.\nOur findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,\nparticularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical\nfailure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches\ntailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for\nadvancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking\nalgorithms."}

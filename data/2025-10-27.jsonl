These adapters are typically trained to\ncapture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using\nsingle-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image\ninevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle\nthe target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and\nlighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs\nthe model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we\nuncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to\neliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,\nconfounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or\nLoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The\nauxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like\nfacial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation\nquality, diversity, and prompt adherence.

Convolutional neural\nnetworks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution\noperations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range\ndependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment\nstructures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this\nrestriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global\ncontext and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based\narchitecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional\nFeature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as\nFM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper.

On the local\ntest sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically\nconsistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in\nimproved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.\nOn the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data\nachieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment\nstrategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline.

We then extend the approach to two other\nwell-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple\nPolygon Problem.\n  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard\nvisual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image\nrepresenting a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.\nThe model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct\nconfigurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.\n  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and\ndomain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric\nrepresentations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on\nthe visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a\nsurprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.\nBeyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader\nparadigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework\nfor approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a\nfar wider class of challenging geometric tasks."}

Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is\ncritical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding\nspurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such\ndependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a\nself-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about\nvisual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the\nagent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a\nself-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain\nmodel behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its\nfindings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach\non a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute\ndependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's\nperformance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant\nperformance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that\nthe agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in\nstate-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object\ndetector."}

While their\nextension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video\ncaptioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In\nthis work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in\npixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based\non natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing\ntechniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video\nMLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to\ngrasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,\nMoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging\nthe interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by\nstatic appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We\nfurther establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or\noutperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation\ntechniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.\nOur motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models\nto improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within\nvideos.

Numerous visual-only approaches\naddress these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,\nyet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex\nocclusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground\ninformation, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by\nhuman perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the\nforeground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background\ndistractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper\nproposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background\ninformation within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To\nhelp the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an\nintra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.\nSpecifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same\nsemantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between\nforeground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative\npower. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background\nregions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.\nComprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with\nresults that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches."}

Moreover, most fMRI\ndatasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation\nand connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies\nautomatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for\nbrain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven\nfMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,\nconnectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid\nfrequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a\ncross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside\nlong-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module\nembeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a\nregularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive\nexperiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses\ncurrent methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,\nspecificity, and area under the ROC curve.

Meanwhile,\nthese advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas\ncurrent benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified\none-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a\ncomprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and\nreasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure\ncomposition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and\nreasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,\ninductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To\nincrease complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world\nscenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for\ncomposition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt\nwith a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each\nintended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable\nevaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts\nand around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models\nreveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex\nhigh-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind\nas a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements\nfrom prompts.

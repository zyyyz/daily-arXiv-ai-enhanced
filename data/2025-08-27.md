Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes

guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive

Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class

detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains

feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational

using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss

Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online

perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern

propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing

tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can

Abstract: This paper presents our solution for the MIDOG 2025 Challenge Track 2, which
focuses on binary classification of normal mitotic figures (NMFs) versus
atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) in histopathological images. Our approach
leverages a ConvNeXt V2 base model with center cropping preprocessing and
5-fold cross-validation ensemble strategy. The method addresses key challenges
including severe class imbalance, high morphological variability, and domain
heterogeneity across different tumor types, species, and scanners. Through
strategic preprocessing with 60% center cropping and mixed precision training,
our model achieved robust performance on the diverse MIDOG 2025 dataset. The
solution demonstrates the effectiveness of modern convolutional architectures
for mitotic figure subtyping while maintaining computational efficiency through
careful architectural choices and training optimizations.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems

repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such

stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector
through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a
bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination
patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy.
We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using
the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation
regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the
CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior
reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly
undersampled regimes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster

Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through

remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot

reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

This work evaluates the SalUn unlearning model by conducting experiments on the
PathMNIST, OrganAMNIST, and BloodMNIST datasets. We also analyse the impact of
data augmentation on the quality of unlearning. Results show that SalUn
achieves performance close to full retraining, indicating an efficient solution
for use in medical applications.

Abstract: In this paper a comparative study of the performance of three Convolutional
Neural Network models, ResNet50, Inception v3 and VGG19 for classification of
skin images with lesions affected by psoriasis is presented. The images used
for training and validation of the models were obtained from specialized
platforms. Some techniques were used to adjust the evaluation metrics of the
neural networks. The results found suggest the model Inception v3 as a valuable
tool for supporting the diagnosis of psoriasis. This is due to its satisfactory
performance with respect to accuracy and F1-Score (97.5% ${\pm}$ 0.2).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

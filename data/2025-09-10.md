Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately

using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a

using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to

thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient

MedicalPatchNet demonstrates substantially improved interpretability with
higher pathology localization accuracy (mean hit-rate 0.485 vs. 0.376 with

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

Abstract: Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in
human-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand

gesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal

It includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects
using two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion
capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal

understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of

prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale

directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,

containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D

missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent

consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

Abstract: Accurate and timely mapping of burned areas is crucial for environmental
monitoring, disaster management, and assessment of climate change. This study
presents a novel approach to automated burned area mapping using the AlphaEArth
dataset combined with the Siamese U-Net deep learning architecture. The
AlphaEArth Dataset, comprising high-resolution optical and thermal infrared
imagery with comprehensive ground-truth annotations, provides an unprecedented
resource for training robust burned area detection models. We trained our model
with the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) dataset in the contiguous US
and evaluated it with 17 regions cross in Europe. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed ensemble approach achieves superior performance
with an overall accuracy of 95%, IoU of 0.6, and F1-score of 74% on the test
dataset. The model successfully identifies burned areas across diverse
ecosystems with complex background, showing particular strength in detecting
partially burned vegetation and fire boundaries and its transferability and
high generalization in burned area mapping. This research contributes to the
advancement of automated fire damage assessment and provides a scalable
solution for global burn area monitoring using the AlphaEarth dataset.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency
in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve
proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial

assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full
pipeline and resources are publicly available at

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

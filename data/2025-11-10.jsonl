This work introduces a novel\nknowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape\nartifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage\nframework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a\nspecialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle\ngradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based\nanomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for\nidentifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography\ndatasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets\nrespectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully\nconcentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with\nAUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn).

In this paper, we\ndescribe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single\nconsumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU\nmemory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce\nperformance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy\nthat exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,\nand thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.\nFurthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce\ncommunication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation\ncan render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single\nRTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality."}

Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3\nmodel family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling\nstate-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires\nthe input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large\namounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer\narchitecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge\ndistillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature\nmaps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the\nbaseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution\nis kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very\nsimilar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost.

Two\nvariants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped\nregions around tumors.

In these settings, visual place\nrecognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based\nmethods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a\nmultimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both\nvision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely\nunstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF\nintegrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose\nestimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient\ncandidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric\nverification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show\nthat MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while\nenhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing\ninterpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a\nfavorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,\ndemonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and\npose estimation.
